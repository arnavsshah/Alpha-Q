" A unique film
",,"Fight Club is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. In addition to presenting a rather fresh take on life, FC also presents its material in a fresh way. My main interest in the film is in that, in my opinion, it does not present characters for us to think about. Rather, it presents actions for us to think about. I will say that I cannot recall *ever* having been ""asked"" by a film to both suspend my disbelief the way this film asks in its third act AND at the same time come to terms with an understanding that there is no room--or need--for disbelief.Perhaps these comments will not make sense to the average movie goer who will dismiss this film--and, unfortunately, its premise--as another hollywood flick filled with gratuitous violence. I'd go as far as to say that this film is not about violence. It is about choices. It is about activity. It is about lethargy. It is about waking up and realizing that at some point in the past we've gone to the toilet and thrown up our dreams without even realizing that society has stuck its fingers down our throat.I would argue that anyone caught, at some point in their lives, between a rock and a hard place--anyone who has reached bottom on a mental level--anyone who has uttered to themselves ""Wait, this isn't right. I would not do/say/feel what it is that I just did/said/felt... I do not like this. I must change before I am forever stuck being the person that I am not."" These people, they will know what I'm talking about. These people will not only recognize the similarities between Edward Norton's character and themselves--they will be uncomfortably familiar with him. These people will appreciate Fight Club for what it is: a wake up call that we are not alone.As David Berman once said: ""I'm afraid I've got more in common with who I was than who I am becoming."" If this sentence makes any sense to you, go see Fight Club. You won't regret it.L.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" This is a very important movie.
",,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, it had me interested.  A movie about guys who fight - it didn't seem to deep, but I thought it would provide entertainment.  I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced.  I should see this movie.  I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD.  I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it again.  And again.  And again.This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and stylistic.  I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes away.  Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern consumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).Norton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life.  He needs something to change his life.  Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away.  Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching.  As for it's ending, it doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away.  One of the best movie endings I've seen.  Even better if you're a Pixies fan.As for it being important, don't worry.  You will be hearing about this movie.  When 'A Clockwork Orange' came out, it was met with mixed reviews, deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic.  These two movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books.  If you haven't read either, get to it.  Politicians will use this movie as a demonstration of careless and consequenceless violence in movies, and as a perfect example of what today's youth are being influenced by.Watch this movie, and watch it again with some of your more intelligent friends.  10 out of 10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Life-changing Fight Club
",,"I am, unfortunately, not one of the faithful Chuck Palahniuk readers who had read the book BEFORE they saw the movie. I, however, couldn't wait to read the book after seeing this film. I've read the book 5 times since and seen the movie more times than I can remember. Simply put, this movie changed my life. Not just on a personal level (on which I will not comment here except to say I'm now a major Palahniuk fan) but also as a movie-watcher. I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors. This movie is literally the first time I ever came upon something that, at first sight seemed incredibly stylish, sophisticated and entertaining. The plot lured you in before turning you upside down, the acting was nothing short of perfect (has there ever been a more memorable character than Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden?), the music, the screenplay (based on what is now my all-time favorite book), the lighting, the pacing, the everything! Virtually everything about this movie took my by surprise, save for one man. David Fincher, director, was probably the only reason I went to see this movie in the first place. His work on 'Seven' and 'The Game' had me excited to see what he would do next, but I came to this movie expecting a stylish flick that offered a good plot and hopefully some good acting but what I got was so much, much more. Honestly, how many times have you seen a movie that, with every viewing, gets even more complicated yet so simple that you can't help but laugh. Every time I watch this movie I notice something new about it, such is the depth of what is on the screen. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk (who has one of the most fertile imaginations around. Don't believe me? Read 'Survivor' and weep!) the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. You'll cry, you'll laugh, you'll do all the clichés but most importantly you'll identify with every single thing on the screen. This movie rates as one of my all-time favorite movies and, simply put, if you haven't seen it yet then quit wasting your time OnLine and get to the nearest videostore! 5/5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Welcome to movie heaven!
",,"Let's ignore the advice and talk about ""Fight Club"". This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher's cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. Despite the risky 'cutting edge' nature of the film, Fincher got a huge budget for this and it shows: the camera effects and the whole production design are amazing.This movie has a raw energy that grips me every time I watch it. What a crazy, fun ride! Whether it is a very clever satire or pure testosterone going on a rampage - both are fine by me. A film so visually stunning and sexy, with career best performances by all involved - welcome to movie heaven.My vote: 10 out of 10Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.
",,"""Fight Club"" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. The film's narrator (Edward Norton) is an insignificant cog in the drab, corporate machine, dutifully doing his job and what he's told without question. He's an insomniac slave to his IKEA possessions and only finds joy in going to as many self-help/dealing with terminal diseases sessions as he can. It provides him with an escape from his sleepless nights. That is, until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a trashy chain-smoking poser, enters his life and upsets his routine. The narrator also meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of ""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula? ""Fight Club"" openly rejects this tired, clearly outdated structure in favour of a stylized frenzy of jump cuts, freeze frames, slow motion and every other film technique in the book that only reinforces its anarchistic message. A film like this would have never been greenlighted by a major studio if Brad Pitt had not been attached to the project. Once you see the film, it becomes obvious that he was the only choice for Tyler Durden. Like he did with ""Kalifornia"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"", Pitt grunges himself down and disappears completely into his role to a frighteningly convincing degree. During many of the brutal fight scenes, he is transformed into a bloody, pulpy mess that'll surely have the ""Legends of the Fall"" fans running for the exits. It is an incredible performance -- probably his best -- for the simple fact that he becomes the character so completely. If Pitt has the flashy, gonzo role, Edward Norton is his perfect foil as the seemingly meek yet sardonic narrator. It's a deceptively understated performance as the last third of the film reveals but Norton nails it perfectly. He is clearly our surrogate, our introduction into this strange world and his wry observations on our consumer-obsessed culture are right on the money. They are the perfect setup for Tyler's introduction and his view on the world which is clearly a call to arms of sorts, a manifesto that rejects the notion that we are what we own. And ultimately, that is what ""Fight Club"" tries to do. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Superb
",,"Superb, and truly one of the greatest movies of all time.It starts with the screenplay. Adapted from, and very faithful to, an excellent book. The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental. Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.An absolute classic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Great Film: Deserved Several Academy Award Nominations
",,"The script was tight, the theme fascinating, the acting incredible (especially Edward Norton, as one might expect), the direction inspired, and the cinematography stunning. It is one of the few films of the past five years that deserves to be seen multiple times.  In fact, if you have seen it only once, you have missed something.  I was seriously hoping the movie would receive Oscar nominations for Best Actor (Norton), Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Picture.So, how is it that the film received no nominations? Unfortunately, it had a mismatched ad campaign.  The ads made it seem like the movie was about street boxing, instead of a intellectual and emotional ride through a man's psyche as he takes a strange path toward rebellion against consumer society. As a result, most who went to see it were disappointed, and those who would recognize its brilliance stayed far away from the movie theaters.  This is one of the most underrated movies I know.I always love movies that keep you entertained and keep you guessing, and this movie scores a 10 in both.  Those who enjoyed The Game, Memento, or The Matrix really should check it out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" It doesn't get much better than this
",,"Similar in idea to 'American Beauty' but certainly not in style or content this bleak look at underground culture and the spiritual redemption it brings is easily one of the most intelligent films I've ever seen. Directed by the same man who brought us the superb 'The Game' this is another film which you'll have to see more than once to truly understand.  Focusing on sad white-collar, middle-class Norton whose only real dream in life is to own all the contents of an IKEA catalogue it follows him through a chance meeting with charismatic stranger Pitt and the unfortunate events which conspire to draw them together. After a nights hard drinking they start a friendly-ish scrap which is viewed by a couple of others and from that small acorn a mighty oak called Fight Club grows. This is the point around which the whole film revolves with Norton and Pitt forming an underground club which draws more and more disillusioned young men to join it. Based on firm 'Queensbury Rules' it is a cathartic if bloody way to spend your night. Eventually as it becomes a huge operation Pitt, the de facto leader, moves it up a gear and creates his own cult from this secret society. This is where the film becomes brilliant and the twist near the end is magnificent, better even than the much talked about 'The Sixth Sense'. It just has so much to say about things: the emasculation of an entire generation of young men (""No great war to fight, no great depression""), the growing isolation we all feel from one another and the need to find something to draw us back together and most importantly, the power of an exciting, challenging idea and it's fermentation into cultism. However, where many films would just say 'This is a bad thing' 'Fight Club' doesn't. It is more a condemnation of a materialistic society which has forgotten about a large section of itself. You can empathise with these men completely, even when they band together against this uncaring society that has reared them to be something their instincts don't understand. It's as close to genius as you'll get and one film you'll talk about and think about for days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A rare film that challenges the viewer to come up with his own interpretations
",,"Faithfully following Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic satire, Fight Club presents the vast emptiness of modern existence- ridden as it is with shallow values, rampant consumerism, empty of meaning, feeling and life itself- in a slick and ironically consumer oriented fashion.  In a different vein from American Beauty, Fight Club explores the solutions to the veritable sleepwalking existence that plagues modern life.  The film is violent, but it is not gratuitous violence, and any reviewer who claims that the film is promoting violence has missed the entire point of the film. A very black comedy, it is sure to provoke much conversation- it is definitely a film to see with friends.  The film is fast-paced, densely packed and merits a second viewing, just to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the book. In typical Fincher style, you the viewer are left to draw your own conclusions. He feels no impetus to tell you how to interpret what you've seen, appropriate since the film condemns falling victim to the strictures of what society tells us to think and to value.  My only criticism is that the editing is not as tight as it could be in the middle section of the film, it drags just a bit then picks up again. Other than that, it should definitely be an Oscar contender.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Brilliant Direction and Superb Acting
",,"Fight Club is a brash slap in the face of consumerism and the working dead. It questions reality. It is strikingly thought provoking and visually stimulating. The direction is incredibly brilliant. Director David Fincher (Aliens, Se7en and The Game) is at his finest here warping both space and time, dropping in things here and there to make things clear. Edward Norton is excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac who catalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house and makes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as Marla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their lives. Her role is critical and she plays it well.There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" A Favorite and a Classic!
",spoiler,"Ever since I first watched this movie a few years back with some of my friends, I loved it. It became a sort of habit of ours to watch it every couple weeks or at least once a month while we laughed and quoted the whole thing for fun. 
 Anyways, what makes this movie better than what the 1999 box office credited it with, is the filmography. My favorite use of camera and film techniques probably had to be the moment where Tyler describes the meaningless of possessions in a shot inside their house as it wobbles from side to side. His calm demeanor reminds you more of Jack rather than himself and his more aggressive tone, creating a sense of foreshadowing the ultimate climax when Jack realizes he is Tyler and Tyler is him. It's also very interesting to see the change from a clear and sunny day in the city to the yellow-tinted bars, basements, and ultimately the abandoned house Jack and Tyler live in at night. There's a feeling of the underground's grime and dirt in these transitions, as well as a feel for the tougher moments in life that are a central theme in this movie.
 This movie also made a high ranking for me because it makes you think. In 1999, people were looking for stability in the shadow of Y2K. They weren't thinking about giving up everything they had, but preserving it and gathering more possessions, as highlighted throughout the film yet again as a central theme. This film goes exactly against contemporary consumer society at the time by instead of telling people to ""buy stuff we don't need"", it emphasizes the ideas of minimalism and even tribalism in some aspects when Tyler talks about ""starting over"" again. What sticks with this movie is that it's message still sticks to us today, perhaps even stronger than in 1999.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Generally positive comments
",,"This film, is basically, at least in my opinion, one of the greatest films ever, period.  I read the book afterwards, and equally enjoyed the book. The film is definitely for younger people, the critics of films, in general are older, so they cannot appreciate this film.  The film defines the younger generation, only younger people can relate to it, however, older people(middle aged+) can appreciate the art of the film, the beauty of the camera work, as well as the excellent acting.  The film, in every aspect is fantastic, it begins with a rather humorous narration, from a person we grow to know as, ""narrator"".  It goes about to show how he lives, and his way of life.  In these scenes alone, movie lines that will go down in history are said, and it's only the first twenty minutes.  The film tends to progress faster and faster as the film continues.  We delve into the narrators psyche, and find that he is not unlike most people in this world, he has a tendency to say to people what they want to hear, even if it is not the truth in it's entirety.  Almost all folks can relate to the main character, and he feels to be a real human, not a character in a story.  This, is partially due to the excellent directing, as well as book, but it is mostly due to the fantastic performance by Edward Norton. It, in my opinion is an Oscar performance.  Bradd Pitt gives his best performance to date, he is definitely an excellent coworker with David Fincher, they seem to share a common thread when it comes to film making I suppose.  I have full intention of purchasing this film when it is released on VHS and DVD.  Do yourself a favour, see this film, if that is not an option, at least read the book.  If you are younger and feel unrest with society, this is the film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" One of the most frustratingly misunderstood films of all time...
",spoiler,"To criticize a film for having a shallow or confused message is understandable. The problem with this criticism is that, in the case of ""Fight Club"", the movie's message is not confused. It knows exactly what it's saying; but many people don't.Not only do some people jump to the conclusion that ""Fight Club"" is condoning violent or sociopathic behavior, but they think it's condoning fascism and terrorism, when it's actually outright mocking it. It's showing the juvenile pointlessness of it. Not only do some people miss that it's satirizing the teenage-rebellion mentality, but they assume it's pandering to it.""Fight Club"" is the story of two people representing two extremes: the Narrator, a white-collar worker who's become a slave to consumerism and the social construct around him, and the other is Tyler Durden, a violent nihilist with no regard for society or others, who feels the human race has been emasculated by materialism and advertising. Essentially, these two are exact opposites. But as the two of them become friends, they start an underground boxing club for the catharsis of people who feel just as trapped and emotionally apathetic as they do. Ultimately, Tyler takes this entire concept and evolves it into ""Project Mayhem"", a group devoted to vandalism and general mischief, but from there, it actively grows into a terrorist organization.The thing that SHOULD be the giveaway that it's not promoting this behavior is through the DEATH of an innocent man as the result of these actions, and the fact that we see the misguided members of Project Mayhem lose their personal identities to a dangerous cult mentality. I said it once and I'll say it again: Project Mayhem and their violent beliefs are not being condoned. And yet, to give you an idea of just how much the themes in ""Fight Club"" are taken out of context, there was a real-life incident with a kid in Manhattan who, influenced by the movie, attempted to blow up a Starbucks, as the Space Monkeys are seen doing in this movie. Of course, despite how obvious it was that this behavior was being mocked in the movie (and, once again, how they show an innocent man get killed as a result), authorities proceeded to scapegoat this movie, as if it was the fault of the film itself that someone foolishly misinterpreted the message and attempted an act of terrorism. The film blatantly portrays Tyler Durden as a fascist and a terrorist, and yet, people actually think it's promoting him, simply because it doesn't outright tell you what to think. ""Fight Club"" is attacked by everyone from politically correct New-Agers and prudish moralists with mantras of ""ZOMG THIS MOVEEZ VIOLINZ FOR THE STOOPID TEENAEGERS LOLZ!11"" (and of course, shouted down by so-called cinephiles for being unconventional in nature, and for being a Hollywood film). I recommend actually thinking this film over instead of going by knee-jerk reaction. If the things that happen in this movie disturb you (especially the ending), then good. They SHOULD disturb you. In short: ""Fight Club"" is condoning Tyler Durden's actions and beliefs as much as ""Schindler's List"" is condoning the Holocaust.Of course, that's my take on how the message is misconstrued, so what else does ""Fight Club"" have to offer? Well, as you'd expect from Fincher, it's a remarkable-looking movie, and the actors make the absolute best of it. It's consistently funny, full of unforgettable characters and dialogue, and most of all, it captures the world and feel of Generation X quite unlike any movie I've ever seen. But therein lies something fascinating: it's the absolute film for its time and place, yet it doesn't feel dated at all. The reason, I theorize, is because it does such an outstanding job of making you a part of the time in which it's set, and giving us something timeless to think about.So what, in my opinion, is the true message of ""Fight Club""? ""Fight Club"" is--and this is important--NOT telling you what to think. It's simply asking you to reflect, question things. Question society, question the false prophets. Keep the balance between these two extremes (Narrator and Tyler)by being an individual.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Not what I expected. One of the best movies ever made.
",,"I had avoided this movie as I had assumed it was 'Rocky Goes Underground'. Saw it last night (May 2013) only because my son wanted to watch it and I was too tired to get off the couch. I was totally blown away. It has no resemblance to Rocky or any other boring boxing movie. Can't stop thinking about it today, certainly can't concentrate on work. Why? Because I totally identify with The Narrator and it seems from the comments here and from the consensus of viewer ratings that I am far from alone. Its not 'Macho Porn', or 'little-boy posturing' as Roger Ebert describes it. It is rather one of the most thought provoking movies I have ever seen.I unleashed my own Tyler Durden 10 years ago, not violently or illegally, but I did turn my back on my serf-like existence as a well- paid corporate slave. Sure it was painful and chaotic. But my marriage survived and now I run my own small business. Sometimes I think I made a mistake, as my former affluent life sure was easier. But it takes a movie like this to remind me how empty it was and how much more satisfying it is to take the road less travelled, to forge my own destiny, to have a proper work life balance that allows me to know my kids and to not be sucked into hollow consumerism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A Pretty Looking Nightmare
",,"David Fincher is terrific with his camera. Visually his films are a wonder. Unfortunately the contents are so thin that the interiors of his tale vanish very quickly. What remains is ""the look"" and the promise, no matter how unfulfilled the promise remains. Edward Norton is sensational, especially in the first 20 minutes of the movie. Brad Pitt, already a film icon, does his thing, and that, of course, is a plus. Helena Bonham Carter surprised me big time with a facade I had never seen. The slow motion of the smoke coming out of her mouth as Fincher introduces her to us is a work of art in itself but, and that ""but"" is a real problem, nothing remains because deep down there is nothing there but a fantastic eye for and to startle and amaze. I'm sure that sooner or later David Fincher will come out with something that is as powerful inside as it is outside.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fincher's half
",,"I sat through the first half of this movie with my mouth open. It was so exciting, brilliant, a Fritz Lang for the new millennium. Edward Norton's face. That insomnia that he carries all over him is so magnificently drawn that creates the opposite effect on its audience. I was awake, very awake, sitting on the edge of my seat, devouring every moment, enjoying it like hell. Helena Bonham Carter was a like a great silent movie star doing her first talkie. Pola Negri, Theda Bara. As if this wan't enough, Brad Pitt, and Brad Pitt is Brad Pitt with all its fabulous connotations. Then, can you explain to me why I detested this movie? Why it made me so angry? Can you? I can only tell you that half way through I turned against the movie or the movie turned against me, either way I didn't like it. I felt cheated in the worse possible way. I felt treated like a moron. You start promising me the most unique film experience I've had in a long time but what you delivered was a tired, opportunistic, gimmicky, easy piece of nonsense. Why? David Fincher is one of the most consummated craftsmen American movies have ever had. Don't you agree? He can tell you a story, even something like ""Seven"", a horror thriller, in a way we've never seen before, at least half of it. He has an eye like no other. That's why my frustration. An artist like that putting himself at the service of something that's not done, not finished not worthy of his talents. You may think I'm being a bit too hard on the man. But let me tell you, it's out of love. I expect so much from him, I've seen what he is capable of. But so far have been only halves. Brilliantly acted, sensational to look at, but halves, just halves. He should look at Fritz Lang, Pietro Germi, Alfred Hitchcock, Michael Powell, William Wellman and naturally John Ford, Martin Scorsese and Steven Spielberg. Fincher already inherited something from each one of them. Now the trick is that it isn't a trick. Half is better than nothing. But in the grand scheme of things, it's not enough.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A complete classic.
",spoiler,"First, for this great masterpiece, I would like to thank David Fincher. The film gives a great message on psychology. But the main purpose is to show what level shambles of today's youth. The film tackles the decline of today's youth in a very hard way. Consumer culture can be said to start with the Starbucks glasses we have seen in the film in many scenes. Consumption in the film can be one of the parts that best describes the society. The Narrator is happiest not in consumption, but in Tyler's punches. It is not a fight against the system, but in the film Fight Club is a rebellious aim. Everyone is alone in the consumer society. Officially something new comes out after today's young people run the thing themselves or dedicate themselves to always search for a leader, this problem offers in a great way the audience. Acting I can say enormous. Formally integrated the roles of the players. Already today, many people have come by Tyler Durden character of history is considered as the best anti-hero. Every part of the film is filled with great criticism about our day. Also great to send on to mention other films. One of the most important elements of the film I'd say the mystery. Indeed, for someone with no knowledge of the subject monitors and film for the first time in a very difficult prediction about the end of the film. Absolutely should for everyone to see, and even to do bedside film is a masterpiece..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A lot of depth for those who look.
",spoiler,"To the world: This isn't really a movie about dumb guys beating each other up because they're too bored to do anything else. No, Fight Club is actually about personal and cultural revolution within a corporate consumer society that destroys the human spirit. At least, that's how I saw it.I loved this movie, and rating it a ten is not some whimsical fancy--I don't hand out gold stars for nothing. It looks good, sounds good, pacing, dialogue, acting, etc. are all excellent. Why it didn't rate higher on the mainstream critics' lists for cinematography alone is beyond me.What really makes this movie shine, though, is the unflinching way in which it looks at North American society--our mass consumerism, our slavery to stuffy corporate office jobs, our growing lack of what makes us human. The movie doesn't pull many punches.Norton's character is the automaton office lackey who is desperately searching for meaning in his materialistic shell of a life, Pitt plays the modern-day surfer/hippie Tyler Durden whose devil-may-care, spontaneous attitude to life offers the perfect (?) solution. These two personalities struggle to reconcile their different perspectives on life without destroying their relationship. To make things more difficult, Bonham Carter creates a love triangle to further test the friendship.Is it better to be free, alive, and chaotic, as in Pitt's anarchistic vision, or safe, secure, and bored like Norton's capitalist American Dream life? Or, can a compromise be found? Can love conquer all? This is the peripheral, deeper stuff Fight Club is made of, not the smack-down action that the trailers and critics focused on.This movie demands at least one viewing. If you're queasy about violence (there is a graphic fight scene or two), then watch it with someone who's already seen it and ask for an edited version. Even if you don't end up respecting the movie's message or the complicated questions it asks, it remains a well-crafted film, deserving of recognition.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" In Tyler we trust

We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very.........."" David Fincher has created a masterpiece based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel.This movie photographs our entire generation,analyzing the dead- ends of our society.The narrator(Edward Norton) has become a person who basically has everything,but nothing.Subconsciously,he tries to find an alternative way to go on with his life but this is not possible cause he has already a wrong perspective.Therefore,he invents Tyler's character as a defensive mechanism.Nobody can realize that they are the same person,until the story shows who Tyler really is and the plot follows a different direction.A great thing about this movie is that Fincher keeps a neutral perspective as the movie ends concerning what is right or wrong.Bombing large buildings is a solution to our society's economic problems?Inventing an alter-ego character is a solution for everybody's personal issues?Creating a fight club is really a way to solve your daily problems?It's up to everyone to make his/her own conclusions at the end of the movie.The director does not preach,he just presents both sides of the same coin. I have read that Brad Pitt has become the only choice for Tyler.I totally agree.This movie would be different with another actor playing this character.It's a brilliant performance.I also think that it wouldn't be among the 10 best movies,if the director was a different one.David Fincher has this ability to deeply analyze a situation and all movie characters.All scenes have his own perspective and the plot never reveals the double character.Norton also gives a unique performance and becomes completely his character which is quite difficult considering that he grows a psychotic behavior. In general,fight club is definitely one of the best movies ever made.It demands more than one viewing in order to be understood completely,but after that it creates lot of discussion.A real masterpiece.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Bizarrely,absurdly and insanely Brilliant.
",spoiler,"I believe the movie-watching community is divided into three parts;the ones who love ""Fight Club"",the ones who hate it and the unfortunate ones who are yet to experience it.To maintain a neutral stance is quite impossible.Once the credits roll, you may be in awe of this logic-defying piece of celluloid or you may detest the seemingly needless depiction of blood,gore and violence.I belong to the former category and hence,what follows is more of a eulogy than review.So, if you have not seen it I,suggest you first give it a watch and then come back.This movie does not live on the edge;it goes beyond.It does not border on the bizarre.It quite literally ventures head-on into the bizarre and refuses to return.Simply put,this movie is the rock star of its generation.The plot revolves about an insomniac (Edward Norton) who is a by-product of the lifestyle obsession.His life is clichéd,branded and superficial;one where the ""Starbucks"" and ""Microsofts"" compensate for the complete void of emotion.He gets addicted to support groups for various ailments,pouring out his heart to complete strangers.Among these groups of terminally-ill people he finds solace making him realize he needs an outlet.In Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) our protagonist finds his outlet and we find one of the all-time great movie characters.And they team up to create the Fight Club.It is in the fights here that they feel life;a far cry from the desensitized worlds they dwell in.To reveal anything beyond this point would be criminal.But to throw light upon the masterful adaptation from Chuck Palahniuk's book is a necessity.David Fincher's execution oozes style in every frame.Each scene brings out his innovation and is a sheer delight from start to finish.The casting is exemplary as Edward Norton as well as Helena Bonham Carter (having quite an integral role) play their parts to precise perfection.But Pitt's Tyler Durden is the zenith of Fight Club.His every word and mannerism is cult.So Hats off to Brad Pitt.As bad as his ""Achilles"" in ""Troy"" may be, his Tyler is,by now, immortal.Beyond that, tight screenplay,impactful dialogs,effective light and sound,a wacky score and stellar direction catapult it into a timeless classic.The essence of ""Fight Club"" lies in its sadomasochistic theme.It shows us the beauty of anarchy and the symmetry of insanity.It asks us to let go,to reject consumerism and to pull ourselves out from the deluge of brand-consciousness,without ever sounding preachy.It asks us to be alive.Blood-splattered fights may not be the most subtle way of telling us but ""How much can you know about yourself if you haven't been in a fight?"" is the Tyler-istic way of saying it.I am Jack's mesmerized head bowed in admiration.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A review
",spoiler,"Fight Club is an adrenaline rush of a film.  A movie that takes you in, twists you around, tests your limits, and leaves you stunned.  It is an incredibly dark comedy, an inspired satire, and, all around, a great film.As the film opens, we are taken through the body of the Narrator (that is how he is credited, for very good reasons), until we arrive looking down the barrel of a gun jammed in his mouth.  The Narrator is played by Edward Norton, in a performance full of so much sarcasm, Kevin Spacey had better start watching his back.  Here Norton once again proves that he is one of the best actors appearing in film today.  His role is a tricky one, but he pulls it off so easily, it seems like child's play.The gun is being held by Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt, who also pulls off a tricky performance.  Pitt is a very good actor who is unfortunately cursed with sex-symbol status, and therefore, not taken too seriously. Here, though, he once again shows that he is an actor.Shortly after this, we learn that buildings throughout the city are wired to explode in minutes.  As this is explained, we are given a spectacular special effects sequence where the camera swoops down the side of the high-rise, passes through the street, into the garage of the building, through a van, and right into the explosive device.  The film uses this effect a few other times in the film, and all to good effect.With this setup, the film flashes back to when the Narrator had a bit of insomnia.  His job is tedious, the stuff in his apartment doesn't seem as nice anymore, and he goes to support groups just to sleep at night.  He has a nice thing going until another `tourist' shows up to one of his support groups.  She is Marla, played with fun and a strange sadness by Helena Bonham Carter.Now the insomnia reappears, he is traveling for work excessively, and he just happens to meet Tyler on an airplane.  They talk for a bit, and the Narrator is intrigued by him.  When he returns home, he finds that it is a pile of rubble; blown out of the building.  His decision: call Tyler.  They have a drink, he asks to stay at Tyler's place (after some convincing), and something strange happens.  Tyler asks the Narrator to hit him.  Thus, the unofficial start of Fight Club.From here, the movie centers on the club and how it is gradually knocked up levels, until we begin to realize what Tyler's philosophy really is and its effects on the Narrator and the other members.David Fincher, who has explored the dark side of human nature in Seven, directs the film in such high style that there is never a dull shot in the film.  He proves he is a visionary director, and I am sure he will have many more opportunities to bring his vision to the screen.It is not often that a film is able to capture its time so perfectly. Earlier this year,  South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut was able to satirize the censorship issue.  Now comes Fight Club, a film about Generation X and corporate America that is brutally honest.  You leave the theater knowing that Tyler's actions are too extreme and anarchistic, but there is something in his words that speak to anyone who is fed up to some degree with the way our society is.  Fight Club is a film worthy of multiple viewings.  The first time, it is a visual experience.  The next time, something deeper appears.  By the third time, if you already haven't, you should see it with some of your more intelligent friends and discuss the issues the film deals with; and there are a lot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Maybe Golf Can Fill The Void!!

You are raptured by consumerism, which includes owning several hundred pounds of Scandinavian furniture.You have a precocious infatuation for a white collar title, and your lackluster, extra curricular activities have dictated that you mollycoddle someone with testicular cancer!! As enticing as all of this sounds, you know what sparks your interest even more, BEATING THE CRAP OUT OF SOMEONE!! (I have been underemployed for over eight years now, I am all ears!!) What do you really want out of life? Recognition at the Neanderthal level, or, to be another citified anonymity? The former, of course!! Brad Pitt conveys his message to Edward Norton very convincingly, and now, the trick is to spread the good news, but, remember rules one and two, you are not allowed to talk about it, and, you are not allowed to talk about it!! How do you persevere under such a deranged set of circumstances? Yes!! Boredom constitutes a first rate felony. Fighting to a near death represents an exuberance that has titillated Edward Norton's character to a personal Nirvana!! Dangerously convoluted logic is the ultimate spirituality. You have experienced excruciating chemical pain, someone torched your condo because they want to get to know you a little better, you got fired because you always have blood stains on your clothes, you want to blow up a credit card centralized information building complex, and sex has not been this sensational since seventh grade!! Nobody said that this was a family oriented film!! The aggregate depravity for all of the characters in the movie transcends a diversified experimentation with needless destruction, their devotion to the non-conventional is a little too difficult to comprehend!! What does anybody really accomplish by going this route anyway? Capitualation to the bizarre? This movie's charades of insurrection are exhilarating to the clinically demented (Otherwise known as the fight club) The less I know, the better off I will be I think!! Banalities pertinent to the Bourgeousie have brazenly threatened this bevy of belligerent overgrown boys who wish to brandish their high levels of testosterone... So Now!! Life is one big boxing ring!! This is a potpourri of apocalyptic misgivings which are socially perverse!! How do you empathize with any of this?... You don't!! This website has ranked this movie the 31st best film out of the top 250 ever made.... To concur with these findings would be tantamount to indulging the character that Brad Pitt played, to the nth degree!! The psychopathic rumination involved in all of these felonious antics are even more repugnant than the eating habits of an alpaca!!! It is truly indicative of human nature to favor the form of fruition which is pecuniary, their form of fruition deals with societal malcontent and mutilation!! The resonating agitation, which serves as an inspiration to everyone in this movie, is commensurate with the film ""Clockwork Orange""!!! Both films possess a ruthless determination to establish an adamant,counter-culture militancy with a bunch of immature misfits!! The macabre actions to both of these movies signify a heinous non-justification which is pertinent to everything!!! This is not what the phrase ""Change your sedentary lifestyle"" means!!! There are other recreational diversions out there, maybe golf can fill the void!! As far as unprecedented creativity goes ""Fight Club"" gets a resoundingly perfect ten!!! Overall, however, for ""Fight Club"" to be ranked the 31st best movie ever produced, I don't know, I really just do not know about that one at all!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Flashback Humor
",spoiler,"(Spoilers herein) Films like this frustrate. This is so competent, so engaging that I curse it for wasting the chance to say something memorable, or important or perhaps both.What's good is the way that they've solved the `narrator problem.' here, the narrator has imagined the hero (we find out), which is rather clever. We become cocreater of the hero because the narrator has cast the whole film as a conversation with us to explain the last scene which we see in flashback at the beginning of the film. Along the way, we are reminded that we are messing with the film, and the film with us. This latter goes so far as to have the hero work as a projectionist, explaining cigarette burns. He inserts subliminal pornography, which we see throughout with a longer, more noticeable flash toward the end. When we find out about Pitt's non-existence, it is underscored by images on `video.' Add to that the inherently cinematic nature of voyeuristic personal violence, and this film has us captured.When we return to the last scene, Pitt tells us that the whole thing is `flashback humor,' the most strongly selfreferential trick I know in film. Obviously, the self-referential notion of narrator is the reason for this film. That's why Ed Norton bought the film rights to `Motherless Brooklyn,' which exploits a similar experiment in the narrative mystery. In that case, the narrator has Tourette's.So the film competently captures us, and then what? A wasted opportunity. My major complaint is that this film meant nothing, imparted nothing, only thumbed its nose as if to say: I can capture you as easily as the doofuses in the story and for just as capricious a reason. We deserve better. You with talent should do better.Lesser complaints:Norton and Pitt are excellent, though Pitt has much the simpler requirement. Why waste Helena Bonham Carter? She's got the moxie; she's been memorable before. I think the director just didn't know how to use her beyond a vapid sullenness. Another wasted opportunity.Narrative tricks like this are best when they follow the detective story `play-fair' model. This is what `The Sixth Sense' does. On a second viewing of that film, everything works, but with new information. More, some minor problems become clearer. Not so with this film. The writers have played too fast and loose with motivations. It is rather in the `oh, that was a dream' or the `oh, time travel reversed that' category. And it could have been tidier in this regard without messing anything up.Most every scene was weird (a good) because it ran against short-term expectations. But the scene where Lou and thug visit the fight club is pure stereotype, and predictable. Why?I wish the last scene were more, more something. This is where it really begins to hit you that the whole thing was motivated by an illusion, with as much effect.Bottom line: this film is so good, and its makers so talented that should be held to higher standards. I give it a 9 for competence. You should see it for that reason. But it has no purpose.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Two-thirds of a good movie . . .
",spoiler,"In an attempt to get to the bottom of 'Fight Club' I had a conversation with someone recently who argued that the people in this movie get into fistfights with one another as a means of expressing themselves. My rebuttal: Couldn't they sit down and have a conversation? Write a diary? Go on Springer? 'Fight Club' stars Edward Norton, one of my favorite actors who always brings a refreshing intelligence to his work. He plays a depressed urbanite who works too hard doing a job he hates and makes expensive orders from the catalogue maybe as a measure of his worth.To us, Norton's character is known only as 'The Narrator'. He has no meaning in his life so he develops and interesting habit: he is addicted to various support groups for Alcoholics, sex addicts and one for men with testicular cancer, among others. He spots a woman named Marla (Helena Bonham Carter) who is attending some of the same meetings. He knows that she is an addict like himself but to keep the illusion real so they have to work out an alternating schedule.On an airplane he meets Tyler Durden who has The Narrator's number right from the start. Later he turns to Tyler for help when his apartment catches fire. So, Tyler takes him into his rather grungy world. Enter Fight Club, an underground society where men get out their feelings and aggressions by beating the snot out of one another. The fight scenes in 'Fight Club' are brutal, bloody but never seem to cause permanent injury.In trying to defend itself 'Fight Club' jumbles it's own twisted message. The idea of this club is apparently to free yourself from the rules that tie us down. I guess getting socked in the head is suppose to give you a thicker skin (but apparently not a concussion). Then the movie turns all the members of the club into a cult. What? Free your mind and then do as you are told? This is about where the movie goes to pieces. 'Fight Club' makes a twist that pulls the rug out from under what little logical reasoning the film had. The screenplay develops the insane logic of the reality of unreality .. . or something like that. Out of respect for those planning to see the movie I will say no more.David Fincher is a director that I have a lot of hope for. This is his fourth film and the impressive, intelligent 'Se7en' showed the full power of his potential. I love the style of his films. He uses dark sets and grimy setting to set the story in motion. I was not impressed by 'Alien3' save for the amazing production design and 'The Game' was badly in need of a sense of humor. 'Fight Club' isn't his worst film because of its impressive first act. Imagine what kind of great social commentary could have come from a movie about two people addicted to 12-step programs. That is original. If I want to see people beat each other up I'll watch Jerry Springer.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Oh, Fight Club, you almost had me there
",,"Movies like this are intensely frustrating. They get so close to the greatness mark, enticing you with how good they are, and then, at the last second, as if to spite you, they pull back and go for the Hollywood ending. And then you almost forget the brilliance of the rest of the movie. And any filmmaker that can come close to blocking out the memory of the great parts of his movie with just one crucial scene needs to be beat up. Or have his face shoved into Meat Loaf's man-titties.But I can mostly forgive David Fincher for leaving that copout ending simply because the rest of the movie is so darn good. This seems to stem mostly from Jim Uhls's close adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, a masterpiece of existentialist grit and wit. The film follows the book through most of its plot, incorporating much of Palahniuk's clever and bitter commentary on our material society into Edward Norton's jaded voice-over narration, which is unnerving for the five seconds it takes to get into the rhythm of the story. That's how good this plot is adapted- we can settle right into a rhythm and a dark tone that match those of the book perfectly.Edward Norton is the perfect choice for Fight Club's bored protagonist, as is Brad Pitt as Tyler, the enigmatic man that encourages Norton's character to join him in starting a fight club. In this club, men come to the basement of a bar and essentially beat each other up in an attempt to reach into the core of their manhood (the screenplay says it with far more deftness than I do). But it's about so much more than the fight club, as Norton's narrator soon discovers. Tyler has a plan to change the very fabric of their society and in the process changes the very fabric of Norton's character's life- more than he realizes at first.For the entire movie, Fight Club is about man's slavery to society and his escape from it. Unfortunately, the ending, which I won't spoil, takes an entirely different direction from this theme, and, as a result, takes the movie an entirely different direction from greatness. The ending of the book, however, is perfect, and if Fincher had stuck with the book through the entire first two hours of the movie, why couldn't he use the book's perfect ending for the last 10 minutes?It's still a must-see though- the ideas expressed by this movie are some everyone should hear and ponder. Plus, it's freaking good entertainment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The comparison to Clockwork Orange makes me puke
",spoiler,"Please.This is a dismal movie.  I'm going to spoil some stuff, so don't read if you don't want, but read on if you want to save some time and money.
After I sat through this abomination, I knew I'd come on here and see that it got great reviews, because it tried to be so artsy that weak-minded people would say they liked it just to try to convince themselves that they have advanced taste.  Midway through I told myself that if I heard that ""I am Jake's this and that"" line again I would get up and leave, but sure enough I kept hearing it and I stayed.  Maybe I'm as dumb as the filmmakers. The fact of the matter is that I haven't seen a plot this full of holes since ""Slugs"".  So if I start a fight club, the participants will just start showing up at my doorstep out of the blue and turn into mind-numbed drones that do my evil bidding???  Not only that, but this movie also taught me that if I stick a gun in my mouth and pull the trigger, not only will I live but I'll be able to talk to people in my normal voice, as long as I put a gauze pad on it.If you still don't know, this movie is about a clinically-depressed guy who's search for therapy leads him to Brad Pitt, who teaches him that beating the bejeezus out of people will brighten his spirits.  More guys find out about this, and they all join the ""fight club"" and then naturally go live with Pitt to become his evil minions.  Of course! This must be how the Wicked Witch found all those monkeys.  Their evil deeds get worse and worse, and the supposedly still-sane Norton inexplicably keeps hanging out with this bunch.  This leads to one totally inane scene where the evil monkeys return from a gunfight with one of their members dead, and all Norton can do is whine ""C'mon guys, cut it out"".So after this movie backs itself into a miserable corner, it's only escape is the equally awful ""It was all a dream"" ending, where we find out that Brad Pitt was just Norton's evil imaginary friend, and that Norton had been committing all these acts himself.  Please audience, forget the fact that the ""imaginary"" Pitt managed to pull Norton from a burning car wreck and pick him up off the ground and hurl him down a flight of stairs.  I don't care how psycho you are, your imaginary friend cannot physically pick you up.Plot hole #9233 asks us to believe that during this short time, Norton had been in EVERY MAJOR CITY in the US forming more armies of mind-numbed robot monkeys, and that every male over the age of 18 in the United States was now a member of his ""secret"" evil gang.  So anyhow, Norton finally realizes that he's been crazy all this time, and to kill Pitt he sticks a gun in his own mouth and blows his neck off, a wound which apparently isn't as debilitating as you would think, since he manages to get right up and make up with his girlfriend and watch peacefully as his evil plot comes to fruition.  But wait, you thought he was sane now and would be horrified at what he did? So would I, but that apparently also is not the case.Before you typically think that my movie tastes aren't as cultured as yours, let me tell you that I loved the masterpiece that was ""A Clockwork Orange"", and this movie was NO ""Clockwork"".  If Clockwork ended by telling you that the old man in the wheelchair was actually the killer and that McDowell was just his evil imagination, then we'd have a comparison, but Kubrick wasn't that horribly stupid.I am Jake's bad movie review.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Action movie with an infantile, rubbish plot.
",,"In short, Fight Club is a movie that attempts to give a distorted portrait of society as an evil in order to facilitate showing violence and yet more violence. But since the protagonist's disbelief in society is not substantiated, the movie has a hard time explaining the destruction plot. So, time has to be spent watching people fight. And of course, the disbelief cannot be motivated: The protagonist complaining that: ""God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas ... We have no Great War. No Great Depression."" is both romanticizing over events in Western history, that made absolutely no sense to the people living it, and at the same time mocking our grandparents and the life and society they fought for, ours.The main character continues: ""We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't"".Well, learning to differentiate between yourself and ""movie gods [and] rock stars"" and learning that life is not all beer and skittles is what growing up is about today.So, Brad Pitt et al., grow up. And go read a book or something.The rubbish quote sums it up pretty good: ""I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men that have ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see it squandered. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas or waiting tables; slaves with white collars. We're the middle children of history. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War is a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy s**t we don't need. We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very p***ed off.

" Wow, what a fun ride!
",,"From the moment the credits were on screen I instantly fell in love with it.Fight Club has changed our lives and the way we look at it. You will see this near the top of peoples lists. That is because people think that this film is correct. Its up to you to decide. Or it could be because it is insanely cool, which it certainly is.Though it is not right to call it Fincher's. As the film is adapted from Chuck Palahniuk's book which I must add is just as great. This is Chuck's masterpiece. The main difference is the endings, Chuck's is a book ending and David's is a film ending. Making both perfect.The film has 3 parts to it, studying the character in which called the Narrator played by Edward Norton. The first part follows him trying to cure himself from insomnia. He finally finds a way to sleep. Crying in self help clubs. To completely lose yourself. He became addicted. And joined all of them. We lose track of time. And all of this becomes a routine. His boring job. Non-stop buying from Ikea, as it makes him feel complete. Going to self help clubs. Cancer. Parasites. All kinds of diseases he said he has. Although he doesn't have to say anything at all. But then, at the very moment, just when he had become comfortable, she ruined everything. She is Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). She is also a faker. With her in the picture our narrator couldn't sleep. He then escapes it all by travelling in his job and spends most of his time on planes flying around America.Then he finds a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman he met on a plane. This then leads the second part. Then Narrator comes to his condo to find it on the ground. Everywhere. Smashed to smithereens. He then calls Tyler to talk about this to. This leads to him staying at Tyler's place but first he must do him a favour; one of the greatest lines in film history. 'I want you to hit me as hard as you can'. Fight Club is born. 8 simple rules for men to fight. To be born again. Soon a lot of men join. Tyler's place is a complete mess. The house looks like its about to fall down at any moment. The Narrator still goes to his job, face full of bruises. He no longer needs the self help clubs. Fight Club grows and Tyler decides to expand it. Just when Marla comes back into his life. Fight Club in itself becomes a cult, a new religion. Then homework comes into action. In which the men of Fight Club go out onto the streets and cause mischief. Which leads the mayhem. Project Mayhem. The third part. The adrenalin starts pumping. But I'm going to let you find that out for yourself.The Narrator guides us through the film telling us his theories and his feelings in metaphors. He is one of the greatest characters of all-time for his one-liners. Not because they are funny. But because they are influential. I guarantee a fan of Fight Club will have those words running through their mind. Tyler Durden also has theories. Yet he does not tell us. He tells the Narrator. We hear. And we believe. Somehow the viewers believe Tyler. He speaks in such a mature way with evidence. His theories are on humanity and manhood. He believes that we are loosing the plot, the original plan for the human race. And the way to get better, is to start again. Marla invades The Narrators life as she feels incomplete too.The depth of the film is incredible and occasionally unrecognized. It's about becoming a man. A real man. The hunter man. The man who will kill. Fighting is just practice. When they take a swing to another man in fight club they are going back to their roots. Not personal roots exactly, but general roots of the gender. It's not pointless violence. It's meaningful. This is why teenage boys love the film so much, not because its cool, but because they can relate to it as they go through puberty. If I were to explain another depth to the film it would be a spoiler so I am going to let you find out for yourself...The cinematography is amazing. The screenplay makes it enjoyable every time and never get old; this means you will soon know all the lines. I love the score, it fits so well. The gritty atmosphere and dark humour make this re-watchable and keeps you watching. The acting is brilliant, and I must say cool. I couldn't imagine anyone else playing these parts. Pitt plays the performance of a life-time, he will always be remembered for Tyler Durden.This has already become a cult classic and a favourite by many. I recommend you join the club if you haven't seen it already, as you will probably not be able to resist.It doesn't get any better than this.10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" boring, over-rated, pretentious, confused, and very silly.
",,"Although this film was watchable for the first hour or so, it goes very rapidly downhill for the sorry remainder of it's duration. There are simply too many different ideas vying for the viewers attention. Intellectuals have found acres and acres of meaning, which David Fincher wanted them too, although he knows that he has simply made an extremely pretentious and boring mess. It's not all doom and gloom though - there are some very good set pieces in the first half of the film that actually entertained me for a while.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Twilight for males.
",spoiler,"So. It flirts a bit with the ideals of anti-conformism and anti-corporate (a bit hypocritical considering a corporate made this movie, but let's pretend otherwise), and then offers as a solution a gang of people meeting up to beat up each other. Like ""to hell with this system, we'll make a super gang of fighters and take over!"". And then what? I see people rebelling but without any goal or project beside rebelling. ""We are tired of this system, we make gangs and beat up corporates!"" I won't even go into the plot flaws of the protagonist etc because that's be too easy.A movie for losers with a lot of passive aggressiveness inside and no solution for it, they just want to rebel. A movie for people who will go all ""eff the system!"" and then buy iPhone 17 on first day, just to complain the following day about their low- paying job. A movie for those typical guys who talk crap about capitalism but if you try to offer them a different system they'll dirty their pants and start sucking their fingers calling mom State to save them from the terrorist. A movie for those who are all rebellious and when stopped by police will go all ""G-Good afternoon Agent"" and sh*t their pants.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" This movie is so different.... so dark......
",spoiler,"Every one of us dream of becoming something. They see themselves as they'd like to be.The whole concept of fight club is so different. People do not fight to win. The movie starts with a strange comic way. You proceed with the movie and you start realizing how minutely the dark side of our life is shown, how minutely the dark side of people are shown. This film will start manipulate your own psychology. YOU will start getting similarities between YOUR psychology and the psychology of the characters in the movie. And in the end of the movie you will suddenly realize that this movie was for YOU. This movie is not like any other movies. This movie conveys something. It manipulates you. When you end this movie you will start to think what did I saw? How could the director show such hard facts and feelings of our life? Then you will start to see it again and again.

" ULTIMATE Dumb Guy movie.
",,"How can we get Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Meatloaf to beat the c**p out of each other?  This movie solves that ""problem,"" and gives the studio license to shoot a film veiled in psuedo-philosophies and violence.It's just dumb.  Don't try looking beneath the surface, because nothing is there (maybe that's the point).  It provides that men are imasculated and shackled by modern life...  their spirits crushed by their jobs and their possessions.  In order to escape, you fight.  It's so simple!  Give up the banalities of ordinary life and find your individuality in a black t-shirt fight gang.  Makes sense.  Teenage males will certainly think so, since it is filmed in the MTV style...  bright color palette, fancy edits, blood... mesmerizing (and simple philosophies tend to go over well on that demographic).It actually starts our promisingly.  I loved the first quarter.  Only when it attempts to provide us with answers that are, sorry, far out of the grasp of the writers, does it fail.Film buffs may want to view it simply for one of the sloppiest, tacked-on ""surprise"" endings in cinema history.  I could only laugh.

" The Most Ridiculous and Overrated Movie in the History of Mankind
",spoiler,"I have tried to keep the number of spoilers to a minimum, while making those that remain as vague as possible.This movie has broken some long-standing records of mine. Let me list them:1. The most irritating movie 2. The most ridiculous high-budget movie (beating Knowing) 3. The most overrated movie (beating Pulp Fiction - Gotta admit, I didn't think this record was going to be beaten for a while longer)To describe this film as a train wreck would be the understatement of the century. There isn't a word or phrase in existence to sum up this colossal nightmare. The closest I can come to it is the word 'abomination'. But go ahead and knock yourself out with a thesaurus. It's definitely the worst high-budget or worst high-rated movie I have ever seen, and I don't think that's a record that will be beaten for a long, long time. The person who wrote this had absolutely no idea how to create a believable or coherent story (or else was trolling). It literally cannot work in the real world in ANY WAY. Even if this were a comic book fiction, the plot would have more holes in it than Britney Spears' brain. But it's set in our world and with ordinary humans. Well, I say 'ordinary', but the humans in this film have seemingly had brain tissue removed so they can get from A to B without wondering what the hell is going on.I could go through the movie and write a thesis on everything that is contrary to good storytelling, but I will instead highlight some things that spring to mind:1. A man goes into his place of work and threatens to kill his boss and co-workers. His boss does nothing at all about it. Not to mention the man is coming into work all the time with a smashed-in face.2. If the ""Fight Club"" were real, the people in it would be dead long before they could enact a master plan. No human could or would inflict this level of damage on such a frequent basis. 3. You cannot beat yourself up the way the main character in this film does. It's physically impossible - and probably mentally impossible, too. When Jim Carrey did this in Liar Liar, we all laughed because it's funny and worked in a comedy. How thick does a director have to be to think this can work in a serious setting? The laws of biology are also absent for the duration of this picture, because a silly thing like fact can interfere with a bad writer's screenplay. Some dumb individuals tried to create their own Fight Club after seeing this movie, but they quickly learned the difference between reality and bad fiction. Brain damage, pain, and serious injury exist in the real world, folks. Who'd have thunk it?4. There is no way that one person (especially a nut job) could infiltrate so many organizations in such a coordinated fashion, or plant so many bombs without people finding out. The real world is a bit more complicated than the moron who wrote this obscenity. A Tom and Jerry cartoon has better logic than this film. 5. Man's apartment (part of a tower block) is blown to bits and the police find out dynamite was involved. Man is told not to go anywhere but is then allowed to jet about the country. He isn't even brought in for questioning. Are you realizing why this story is cuckoo, yet?6. There is no possible way a psychopath could brainwash so many people and form a large-scale army, spread over such a wide area. But the plot needs it to happen - so it does. Oh, I love it when writers do that. Don't you?7. The twist makes as much sense as the rest of the film. It's not just impossible, it's ludicrous. It's so bad that even a three year old would laugh at it.Fight Club also joins Pulp Fiction and Goodfellas as films to be in the top 20 simply because of gratuitous violence and gore. At least Goodfellas is a decent film with some basis in reality.The only reason this film has been rated so high is because the dumb masses will swallow anything with violence and a pseudo-intellectual script. People who gave this film 10/10 are either gormless fools or mindless barbarians. It's an absolute travesty for the human race that Fight Club is currently in the top 10, let alone top 250.It's beyond all my powers of reasoning to comprehend how people can like something as lazily written and ridiculous as this festering disease of a film. It has absolutely zero credibility.My rating 0/5: DO NOT WATCH. STEER WELL CLEAR. Even the name 'Fight Club' should tell you something about the intellect that created it - by the looks of it, another sneering champagne socialist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" An awful bore
",spoiler,"I really didn't enjoy this film at all & I fall into the target group (male 20-30). 2/10 I'd give this.There seems a belief too that anyone who doesn't enjoy it is either thick, against violence or especially 'doesn't get the message behind it'. Well, none of those apply to me.In this flawed film, I understand that it was any of: a)a group of young men rebelling against a Borgeousie consumerism society. b)one man seeing how he is totally dissatisfied with life and how his mind tries to change things or c)people stopping to watch Cornelius fight himself because voyeurism is human nature the film makes a deliberate attempt to make the viewer feel guilty for being a voyeur. (I'll come to that later)You can take your pick really, whatever way, I still find it crap. Any film (Shawshank Redmeption excepted) which concerns 'one mans' anything, generally creates no emotion in me other than boredom. The whole tagline to the film makes me want to puke: ""one 30 year old man's journey of self-discovery.""So what? Are we supposed to sympathise with Norton because of this? I'm sorry but I have sympathy in films with people dying, or who's family have been killed. John Hurt triumphing over cancer in Champions, Tom Hanks in Saving Private Ryan, thousands of others. Even Norton himself actually in the brilliant American History X. In the 2nd half, I sympathise with him for the life he has found himself with.But in this (and I find myself saying the same as I did with the equally awful American Beauty) Just because some blokes fed up & having a midlife crisis we're supposed to feel for him. Oh diddums. The only film where this premise has worked brilliantly is 'It's a Wonderful Life' with James Stewart. He was in crisis (and justifyably too) but never resorted to any of the levels stooped to here.(That might seem a weak point, but It's just come to me & I can't put my finger on exactly why Wonderful Life is so far superior to Fight Club in tackling a midlife crisis, but they are as far extreme as you can get)
I'd also question whether we're all voyers? For every moron that slows down on a motorway to look at an accident on the other side, there's a 100 or so that can't believe the stupidity of it.There are countless flaws too. The scene prior to the car crash wouldn't have worked? Who was Norton talking to? with the passengers there? Where did he acquire his knowledge of soap from? Would people have watched 1 bloke fighting himself? and much more too. Ok, maybe one or 2 of those have answers but I couldn't find them.I think to really enjoy this film, you have to have clicked or empathised with the main character, and if you did, I feel a bit sorry for you. It would however account for the popularity of such things as marriage guidance councillors, drugs, footballers agents, even to a degree religion (but only when it becomes absolutely fanatical & life revolves around it).
Maybe it's just me & I'm fortunate but so many people seem unable to get through the little problems that life throws up on their own & without help of any kind anymore, like inventing a friend for one thing.I know plenty of people who like this, intelligent some of them, so I've no problem with people who enjoy 'Arty & deep' films with psychological meaning to them. I just don't. But not through failing to understand them, Just merely through not connecting with characters who suffer problems like a 'mid-life crisis for non deserving reasons'.On top of all of that, it was a very slow film too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" A controversial satire and a contemporary classic. perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11
",,"Solid Acting and Amazing Direction A movie that wants to keep its audience unsettled from beginning to end. perhaps the most post-9/11 film to have been made pre-9/11, capturing perfectly both the stirring discontent of the Nineties and the madness both geopolitical and especially economic, that would erupt globally in the decade to come. Wildly inventive, exceptionally cast and undeniably controversial, there's an endless list of subtexts and viewpoints which will fuel debates for years. Fight Club is not just a movie, but a wake up call to a disenfranchised generation sick of being told by advertising what to drive, wear, buy, smoke, drink and eat in order to be cool.

" This clunker is so bad it made my DVD player start a protest movement. Undoubtedly the worst turkey in movie History.
",spoiler,"Let me put it this way: If I ever had to list the 10 scariest things that could happen to me, I'd say in first place: living in a country where this turd is considered a masterpiece. Oh no wait, that would be second. First would be having to raise kids in such a place. And If you happen to live there I strongly advice you to get the heck out as fast as you can because that country is rotten to the core culturally, morally and spiritually, a zombie place. There's something profoundly wrong in the ""idea"" that any issue a man can have with society can be addressed by him meeting some others in his same situation and beating each other senseless. That's the dumbest idea that has ever come to any entity walking on two legs and the scariest thing is that someone had actually the resources to put this monstrosity in the form of a movie; even worse, that there may be a constituency for it out there. Fortunately, it seems that most of that crowd is concentrated in a few places which must be a relief for sensible people around the world. So just stay away from those places and everything will be fine.Now, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this because of the violence in FC. I never judge a movie only by the amount of violence in it; I may even love it if that violence is pertinent to the plot. I loved Apocalypses Now, also The Thin Red Line, and even if I could hardly stomach Texas Chainsaw Massacre I still was able to appreciate the movie as a poignant metaphor for Vietnam; the plight of thousands of boys sent to the slaughterhouse to feed with their blood the career ambitions of some farts in Washington; all sent to be chopped to pieces so some brass could get his medal, some politician could get elected and so on. That's a strong metaphor for a film and that's why I respect TCM as a honest work of art. FC lacks any of that artistic integrity. This is just pure, crass, commercialism; barefaced manipulation of emotionally unstable teenagers, borderline psycho teenagers .But above all a gross a display of gratuitous violence; violence for the sake of it, under a thin veneer of a study on social discontent. I have never heard a more ridiculously phony speech in a movie than the one ""rebel"" Pitt addresses to his pathetic minions when listing the ills of society. If things are that bad, why don't they start a political party, an Occupy movement; why don't they go help the homeless, start a stage troupe featuring Bretch? But of course that would be too much, like asking cockroaches to perform The Nutcracker. Because these are the dregs of society, don't ask from them anything more sophisticated or high minded that knocking each other cold. If you are one of those who becomes fascinated by the sight of drunken bums urinating in the street or fighting with each other, this is one for you. Enjoy it.Now, even if I'm not prone to conspiracy theories I can't fail to notice that most ""protest"" or ""rebel"" flicks coming out of Hollywood do nothing more that discredit the very causes they are supposedly advocating, starting with that dreck of the 1960s, Easy Rider, where social discontent--once again--doesn't lead to social or political participation, to the raising of mass consciousness, but to farcical hippie-communal schemes and to drug trafficking & consumption. I'm not saying that there is an ongoing corporate sponsored plot set to discredit the chances of any social or political alternative to the present established order, but it certainly looks that way. In my VFV review I noted the poor quality of the social and political debate in the Anglo Saxon world, but even in that movie, shot in the U.K., there is a hint of the right way of doing things when the total sum of individual protests turns into collective empowerment. Yet in Hollywood such kind of thing seems unattainable. There, if you have a social or political beef to take to the open the only way seemingly accessible to you is banditry, drug consumption, terrorism, even mental illness--or useless, inane bleating, like in Network, The Graduate.I wasn't even thinking about reviewing FC, as after reading some ""Hated It"" I realized that everything I had to say had already been said. Anyway I'm not writing here a review but a warning for all to stay away from it. What urged me most to write it was to read some rave reviews about how it has changed lives. FC as a life changing experience! Wow, we have seen it all, really. If you think this dog has changed your life I tremble imagining what kind of life you led before and I tremble even more picturing what it may become.This is not a review but a public service warning, I said, so I won't dignify it with technical comments. I'll just say the score is grating and Norton offers the most annoying voice-over in film history. This dog is so bad, at some point my DVD player stopped playing it, it just couldn't take it anymore; and not to be left behind the TV set unplugged itself. Talk about not taking chances! Worse that Irreversible, Possession and Bad Santa all put together. Worst flick in History.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Too good to be bad , but it is

He  narrates  the film , guiding  us  through  his  pathetic  and  hopeless  life . I  was immediately  taken  in  by  the  movie's  slick  visual  style , and Norton's  performance  is  especially  convincing . It  is  here  the movie begins  to  crumble . Funny  how  it's  possible  to  pinpoint  the exact moment  when  it  starts  to  turn  sour . It  is  when  Norton  meets Brad Pitt's  character  on  an  airplane . He's  a  neo-facist  who  teaches self-liberation  through  violence . Norton  is  intrigued  and  joins his group  of  recruits  who  act  out  their  rage  by  pounding  on  each other  in  dark  cellars . Once  Norton  moves  in  with  Pitt  the  movie begins  to  pander  and  get  off  track . It  becomes  more  like watching a  very  bloody  remake  of  The  Odd  Couple .

The  suprise  endings  of  Magnolia  and  The  Sixth  Sense  worked , because  they  interlocked  with  their  themes , but  the  ending  in Fight  Club  looks  like  it  was  added  on  just  to  give  it  a  kick . Then  there's  the  final  scene ,  which  is  illogical  and  serves only as  a  cop-out , as  the  movie  ducks  responsibility  to  its  real theme , Norton's  unstable  mental  condition . The  material  was  here  for  a compelling  film , but  Fight  Club  never  explores  it . Instead , it falls  into  standard , formulized  Hollywood  mush .

" How Come?
",,"The first time I watched this flick is when I'm in my junior high. My thought are what an amazing film this is. Ten years later in my College I watched this again and I'm in the awestruck, how come such a splendid craftsmanship bring so much joy to my life. After the first watched now 17 years later I watched it with my pregnant wife. And she's had the same reaction like when I'm in Junior high. Times goes by, but this film is sit still the Thorne of awesomeness.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" It stays in the fight club.
",spoiler,"Fight Club is a brash slap in the face of consumerism and the working dead. It questions reality. It is strikingly thought provoking and visually stimulating. The direction is incredibly brilliant. Director David Fincher (Aliens, Se7en and The Game) is at his finest here warping both space and time, dropping in things here and there to make things clear. Edward Norton is excellent as Jack, the narrator of the movie. He is a nerdy insomniac who catalog shops at Ikea and has a going nowhere job. Brad Pitt is dynamic as Tyler Durden, an anarchistic man who lives in a run-down abandoned house and makes and sells soap for a living. Helen Bonham Carter is also great as Marla Singer, the manic-depressive chain-smoking woman in both their lives. Her role is critical and she plays it well. There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Feminist manifesto or Fascist parable? You be the judge
",spoiler,"Here are some thoughts about and inspired by a  film that is not only frightening, subversive on hidden as well as surface levels, self-contemplating, knowingly hypocritical and proud of it,  but also a feminist manifesto of sorts and the best comedy (albeit 'black' as coal, of course) about male insecurities since Blake Edwards' '10:' SPOILER ALERT Fincher's film is a case of biting the hand that feeds with full consent of the bitten, who don't realize the  ramifications or don't think they matter much anymore in this day and age.  But already, the word is out on this guy. He'll probably go back to making more ordinary fare like 'Seven' or 'The Game.'  Within the Hollywood system, he'll have to.  I'll be very pleasantly surprised if he shows some hardcore integrity and makes an independent film instead.   Fight Club was a one time hustle that didn't pay-off enough at the box-office to be repeated.  Though it may have spawned evil offspring that will turn up in unexpected areas..The narration is from the point of view of a Norton (Jack) who has finally discovered and become fully aware of his multiple personality.  He is now recalling with a metaphorical gun in his mouth (the dream state shown as real to fool the audience and get their full sympathy before betraying them; absolutely essential in an undertaking of this kind).  His Tyler personality wants to kill his Jack personality and things have come to an ultimate head. Tyler has run amok without his Jack side checking him or being aware of him, and a final decision has to be made.  A new self has to emerge.  The flashback of the events that led to this, however, the movie itself, is SHOWN from the point of view of the Lost Jack, the one who is unaware of the existence of his split personality and the increasing dominance of the Tyler portion even when Marla tells him that she's never seen anyone nearly as nuts as him.  Marla is, in fact, attracted to this guy precisely because he is even more nuts than her (though he thinks of himself as sane).`Except for their humping, Tyler and Marla were never in the same room,' why?  Because the Jack (Jeckyl) personality can't stand Marla (he's too insecure to imagine himself with a girl as screwed up as her), while the Tyler (Hyde) personality uses her for sex.  The narration is aware of this, in retrospect (with enlightened Jack now trying to undo his own doings as Tyler and struggling with this stronger but more evil self which threatens to kill his saner but weaker old self),  while the flashback -Jack, as he is going through it, is confused and is SHOWN to be so.  Jack lets the receiver hang, disgusted by Marla's suicide attempt and couldn't care less if she died, comes back as Tyler, decides to help her out, but then uses her for sex but refuses to take the relationship any further. So neither of these selves are entirely good or bad, it's just that the Tyler self is the one more susceptible to hoodlumism and psychotic behavior.  In fact both selves represent different reactions to feminine power or different faces of male insecurity about its feminine side.  Jack is passively hateful while Tyler expresses his hatred by actively using.  Later on, Jack realizes that Marla is the one who really gave him back his masculinity (she was  his 'power animal' not the penguin!) and that he hasn't been able to admit this (admitting that a woman as screwed-up as Marla can actually have a positive effect on his life, wouldn't sit well with either personality's ego defenses).  At this point a metamorphosis has occurred because  neither of the selves really cared for Marla.  A third version of Jack has begun to emerge, sort of a combination of the best qualities of his former selves, with the addition of Marla (who can be seen as yet another part of his personality, or his feminine side).  But in order to achieve this new plateau, Jack has to snuff out whatever evil remnants of the Tyler Durden self that still remain.Every salesman knows this:  attitude is everything, it's not a product you're selling it's yourself.  People are always buying 'concepts of becoming' rather than products.  In a very real sense, all products are dreams waiting to be sold.   Jack as Jack could never have convinced all these roughnecks to follow him.  Jack as Tyler absolutely could.  He could sell them on that all-out joy of male bonding that comes only when men have respect for each other on the gut physical 'fighting' level; on a more complex level, this is in fact, the 'fascist' dream, so to speak.  The 'strength-bonding' of a whole nation of fearless, ideologically determined killers.  Hitler was very much an advocate of this type of bonding through physical strength and weeding out of the weak.THE ONE MAIN DEFECT: there should've been a couple of more short scenes of Norton acting completely like Tyler, instead of the silly shots of him punching himself (since most of the self-punching is supposed to be metaphorical in nature anyway).  Norton is one of the few actors who could've pulled this off, acted like Pitt down to the detail of his laugh. For example, a quick scene of him, as Tyler recruiting someone for Fight Club, telling someone to hit him, or taking it from Mr. Lou's Tavern would not have been too much; it would've been just what's needed to really send this flick over the top by emphasizing the validity of its multiple personality angle.   As things are, Fincher did a great job but left things way too ambiguous even for someone willing to dig deep.Why is it important not to be too much of a wimp?  Why is it important not to be too much of a tough guy?  Why do both states need to be tempered by each other?  What concepts of 'geek' and 'stud' are operative in our culture by way of their adaptability to keeping consumers somnambulistic?  Have you ever seen a tough guy buy diet Coke?  No, they always buy soft drinks with the maximum sugar possible and Marlboro Reds so they can breathe at night. How much of a readiness to physically fight does it take to be a 'man' as opposed to a gorilla (an able protector of woman and child and worthy recipient of reproductive favors in natural selection, if society was a jungle)?Fighting as intimidation; fighting as release of anger.  Fighting as catharsis; Fighting as a reclaiming of the ego when all else has failed. Fighting as the reclaiming of overthrown male prerogatives in an emasculating modern world (it helps to balance the psyche or nervous system against an intemperate amount of rage by providing an outlet).  The week before I first saw FC, I got in a ridiculous fight with and got punched in the face pretty good.  For a whole week after this incident,  I was walking on air.  All the rage and tension were gone.  I hadn't realized how much tension I had been carrying until it got released.  FC was a whole movie about this very state that I had just gone through and its direct link to emasculation.  I had never thought of myself as emasculated before.  I thought it only applied to macho chauvinist types.  I must've had more of both tendencies in me than I'd suspected.  Fincher's film made me see this very clearly.One reason FC flopped is because people like to identify intensely with hoodlums and criminals and fascists of all kinds on a metaphorical level (the Godfather trilogy which passes for Marxist criticism has made over 1 billion dollars precisely through fascist appeal to the masses) and they don't like it when these 'antiheroes' are made to look like utter idiots within situations that in other films would consolidate their 'heroic' criminality .  The scene where Brad and the boys pull the commissioner in the bathroom and the camera looks up on them from the commissioner's angle. These guys look menacing but in a way that also makes them look absurd and ridiculous.  You can't help but laugh at them.  These clowns (looking like Mexican wrestlers with masks on their faces) are trying to take over the world from the powers that be?  Are you kidding?  Do they have any idea what they're fighting? No, we're kidding and not kidding at the same time! Ambiguity is at the core of all human behavior.  Remember the precedents of the past?  Hitler, Mussolini, Stalin, Idi Amin, Jim Jones? All clowns who did tremendous damage...So this stuff can be laughed at, but it cannot be dismissed, it must be recognized.  Fincher gives us the opportunity to do both, if we're willing; the choice is ours.With regard to Pitt's beating from Mafioso Lou.  You can laugh in the face of someone who's beating you into a pulp until he either beats you to death or gives up.  Either way you win psychologically, which is where all real battles are won.  Even the most cold-hearted s.o.b will be haunted for the rest of his miserable life by the fact that he beat someone to death who laughed straight out loony in his face with every punch.  In the macho contest of fearlessness he has lost.  In the macho contest of craziness he has lost.  In the not so 'respectable' area of straight out cold brutality he has won.  He has been fully exposed as illegitimate and absurd by someone willing to take the absurdity to its limits.The many selves we shed but whose remnants we nevertheless retain as we evolve towards our 'ideal' self, which is itself  a combination of selves and transitory.  The many selves present within any individual at any given time with different levels of influence on his overall personality depending on his values.  The incompatibility of certain selves which are contradictory and require a complete reversal of values to coexist (hence the phenomenon of multiple personality which forgets entirely one self in order to make possible the existence of another).  What is it that makes this schizoid state mandatory?  What has produced it?  It must be a defense against something?  But what?  Why does a person feel the need to create these selves within himself and hide them from each other.  Most people don't even have the self-awareness or self-knowledge to know what the hell is going on, they just do it automaticallyIt's ignorance of fascism that creates fascism, not a thorough familiarity with its nature.  A familiarity with its nature is much more likely to render it absurd than romantic.  People do not like to have an absurd image of themselves in their heads.  It makes them uncomfortable.  But heroic, romantic, tough guys and killers with power?  Oh Yeah! That image of themselves gives them wet dreams.  One famous example even took Travis Bickle's 'heroism'  to be romantic and went out and shot politicians. Fincher's film damn near slams the door shut on fascist fantasies for anyone willing to give his film a few looks and a few thoughts and dig deeper. He makes these guys truly laughable.  He does not deny the necessity and appeal of physical bravery and the catharsis of fighting, but after you've seen bruised and beaten faces for an hour and a half, he shows you Jared Leto's deformed face as a final reminder of how 'tough guys' get to look like Martians.  Any guy in the audience who wants to lose all his teeth or pull them out of his gums one by one or look as f'd up as Leto, is welcome to start a bare knuckle Fight Club.  Most of the angry, frustrated, emasculated males in the audience will most likely prefer to keep their teeth and whatever looks they have, so at the most, they'll head for the nearest boxing gym or weight room. There they will seek to regain their increasingly useless 'macho' selves.The use of subliminal pictures.  Fincher's way of saying: Yes.  This is Hollywood goddammit! We are trying to manipulate you; but you know this already, so grow beyond it.  Become aware of it or be suckers forever.Fincher's ultimate joke is played on the public itself which thinks it can demand artists to conform and pander to its atrocious tastes.  Fincher says don't worry we're pandering, but just enough to get this baby made by Hollywood to the tune of 60 million dollars (here's Brad's naked abs and pubic hair for you, there's the latest in special effects with roofs blowing off airplanes to make you think you're getting your money's worth).  On the other hand, don't expect us to pander in a way that makes you look smart. We are giving you what you want so that we can sneak in and smuggle what you don't want, something that may serve to enlighten you a little bit.The ultimate irony is that general audiences actually understood this total disrespect for them (evident throughout every frame of FC and culminating in the 'twist' which isn't really one at all), that's why the movie flopped after a great opening weekend.  I remember being in a packed house on a Friday night, behind a bunch of guys who loved everything up until the point where the multiple personality is revealed, and then instantly reversed their opinion and started saying how much BS the film was.  'Oh man, that's so stupid,' they kept saying over and over again.  It was as if they had been given a big middle finger right in their faces.  They laughed at the scene where pornographic shots were inserted in a kid's movie but now that a variation of that trick was being played on them in a not so obvious way, they sure as hell didn't like it. These types of guys are everywhere. They have a sense of humor (quite often sick) about everything but themselves; that's where it stops because it gets too painful.  They wouldn't have minded much if Fincher had put in an idiotic action movie ending, with thousands of rounds of ammunition flying everywhere between Tyler's hoods and the corporation militias., maybe even a climactic Rocky type fight to the death with blood and teeth flying everywhere.  Fincher's point is something he himself was most probably not aware of, but he makes it nevertheless through instinct.  Any so called 'sense of humor,' no matter how extreme or 'black' it is, that does not include yourself as an object is a cop-out and a refuge for scoundrels and will be preyed upon by others aware of this.  (Most comedians are very much aware of this and use it to their advantage.  Howard Stern's entire on-air personality, for example, is a fortress built with walls made of self-deprecating humor which others will not resort to, because their inflated egos can't take it;  hence his advantage over them and his ability to 'cut them down to size').FC becomes at the end almost a feminist film in the way it ruthlessly ridicules male prerogatives and macho fantasies.  The fighters are made to look dirty, stupid, homoerotic; like a pack of dogs clamoring for blood. Their physical bravery is useful for intimidation purposes but sadomasochistic and grotesquely pathological.  Note Pitt's pimp outfit towards the film's end subtly implying yet another male dominance fantasy in emasculated yuppie land.  Jack through his transformation into Tyler has gone from humbled yuppie to blackmailer and has finally arrived at what he assumes to be the pinnacle: a man with mystical power over women, who can keep them in their place.  In fact, the entire film can be seen as going on in Jack's head, with Marla as his estranged feminine side, which he comes into contact with at the end to temper the out-of-control 'unbermensch' side represented by Tyler.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Precious and obvious
",,"The first half hour or so was pretty entertaining, even if most of it consisted of Edward Norton telling us what we were seeing (you know, God forbid we should use our abilities to surmise what's going on). And since I saw it on video, I could use slo-mo to catch Brad's ""Where's Waldo"" bits. As soon as Norton met Brad, it was all downhill. Even a really fine, insightful actor would have had a hard time making those pretentious lines sound significant, but Brad Pitt's spewing of them was like a nearsighted used car dealer reading cue cards. This movie was so obvious, so pretentious, and such a total con job, right up to the absurd plot twist three-quarters of the way through that completely invalidated everything that came before it. Also, for a movie that was so preachy about consumerism (""You are not your car, your khakis,"" all that hackneyed nonsense), did anyone else notice that all the tired young execs at Fight Club proper seemed to spend alot of time at the gym? Nary a pot belly to be found, save for poor Meat Loaf, who was somehow exempt from the ""no shirt/no shoes"" rule. Large-breasted Meat Loaf fighting shirtless--now that would have been shocking.Everything this movie had to say has been said before, and better. And sometimes just as badly. (See ""Zabriskie Point"" for another example of an overblown, smug rumination on being yourself and getting back to basics vs. evil products like Wonder Bread.) ""Fight Club"" was just a cynical exercise from a self-important director seeing how much he could get away with.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" 435,000 people gave this movie a 10
",,"It would be interesting to know the ages of the people who gave this movie more than 5 stars. I just cannot imagine they are older than 20, most of them must be between 13 and 17.The title of this movie made me avoid it like the pest for a long time, sensing it was going to be bad. Yesterday, I finally watched it, and boy, it was even worse than I thought it would be! It was so bad that from time to time I had to fast forward it.This movie's biggest problem: unbelievably contrived. Its sole purpose is desperately try to be different, shocking, revolutionary, subversive. It tries so hard that it fails miserably. And for one simple reason: childishness.Watching grownup men being constantly childish is simply not funny, much less interesting.

" Most overrated POS on the top 250
",,"I went to see this with a friend because I'd heard 'it was good' at the local IMAX theater, no less. I went in with absolutely no knowledge on it whatsoever. Once I actually saw it, I realized it was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, and I've seen some real stinkers. I'd rather have my eyelids held open by toothpicks while tied to a chair in front of a screen showing a back to back Ed Wood marathon.I can't think of a single thing I enjoyed about Fight Club. What there is of a plot is all over the place, the lines are beyond cringe-worthy, it's way too preachy, and the 'plot twist' at the end manages to veer off way past the range of strange into the range of bat**** crazy.The secret longing of men is to beat each other up in basements and blow up buildings? Who knew? Much like the fights, there's no subtlety in the plots. Yeah, yeah, materialism is bad, we're not what we own, blah blah blah. Did we really need that pounded into our skulls for almost 2 hours? If you feel like you're in a rat race and you hate your job, THEN QUIT AND FIND SOMETHING TO DO THAT'S MORE WORTHWHILE TO YOU.I could hardly believe that was Brad Pitt. His performances in 12 Monkeys and Se7en were far superior to this trashy flick.Is Fincher incapable of making a movie that doesn't look like the lenses have been sprayed with Campbell's beef broth? The cinematography is choppy, and there's only so much I can take of random dudes beating the snot out of each other for no reason.They should have used some of that soap to clean up the film.From me, 1 star.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I am addicted to this film, in a way it motivates me; therefore whenever I feel low I choose to watch this film.
",spoiler,"Fight club is made by one of my favorite film-maker David Fincher. It is based on the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk. Edward Norton & Brad Pitt have acted in this film.I love this film because of its philosophy. Probably this is one film which is very close to my heart. I am addicted to this film, in a way it motivates me; therefore whenever I feel low I choose to watch this film.I also love this film for its motivational quotes, its unconventional characters, stylized treatment, and dripping background scoresHowever, I don't think that any conscious reason will justify my explanation behind taking this film as a topic for film analysis; hence I will only say that this is my kind of cinema. Story:- Fight Club is a fascinating story of an Edward Norton and his world, his inner as well as outer world. This is a story of Tyler Durden. Edward Norton is a social animal who lives a monotonous life. He buys everything of which he sees an advertisement, however at the end of the day he also knows that nothing is worth buying. He is bored of his routine and flat life. He is bored of his falsehood, the artificiality in him have created all the complication in the story. On one not so fine day his fully furnished and occupied complex caught fire, he felt so lost and depressed. He just wanted to share his grief to anybody, hence he called Tyler Durden to whom he has recently met in an airplane and with whom he has also exchanged a number. This was his greatest mistake. Tyler was smart, dynamic and everything that Edward Norton has always aspires to be. Tyler was free from all kind of obligation and responsibilities. Edward Norton collaborated with Tyler and starts a club known as Fight Club. Fight Club is the way to break free. It is a club where two people will fight with each other. It is a club with the certain set of rules. Members of fight club are obliged to these rules. Tyler was the mentor, motivator and inspiration for the club member, they respect Tyler. This brought Tyler an opportunity to initiate project ""Mayhem"" (I am not going to disclose the details of Project Mayhem as it will be spoiler). However I will like to tell that Project Mayhem was all about destruction, it was all about economic equilibrium. Edward Norton didn't want this to happen as it will create havoc, and thus he fought against Project Mayhem, he fought against Tyler. But how can you defeat the animal within? Fight Club is a social film which deals with metaphysical plot.""Tyler Durden"" is one of my favorite characters in the history of cinema, and Brad Pitt has excellently portrayed the character of Tyler Durden. I don't think that any other Actor other than Brad Pitt would have done justice to this character. Brad Pitt has given style to the character which was needed. I think Brad Pitt was most appropriate for the role of Tyler Durden however I will also say that the character of Tyler Durden was such a well written character half the job of the actor was done while writing it.Edward Norton is a fantastic actor, he have a capability to get into the skin of the character. In this film he has played a narrator and story was said from his point of view. I will say that Edward Norton have done a great job, as his character was recognized even after the presence of the strong character of Tyler Durden.David Fincher is a great storyteller he had courage to tell this complicated story with such a style and elegance. I have watched this film hundreds of time, and after watching and re-watching this film again and again I can say that this may be one of flawless film that I have watched. I respect the director for his detailing on the script, on his characters. I respect him for the style that he put in the film. I respect him for the subject of the film. Dialogues is also one of the most important part of this film, every time Tyler Durden speaks his words punches the viewer on their face. This film is full of quote and I will like to mention some of it over here.""Things that you own ends up owning you""""You are not the content of the wallet, You are not your job, You are not the car that you own, You are all the singing and dancing crab of this world""And many moreHypnotic background score and cinematography have done its job. On a whole I love this film as it motivates me every time I watch this.Strongly Recommended...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Something doesn't quite fit with this movie...
",,"As an earlier comment stated, the first 2/3rds of this movie are truly intriguing. The visuals are slick, but not in you Blade-meets-Mortal-Kombat kinda way, instead focusing on delivering irony, sarcasm and black jokes through flawless direction and edition ( and even some hi tech effects, like when the credits roll).   Edward Norton plays the narrator, and the social satire presented during the first half of the flic is simply put, awesome, because the movie doesn't seem to take itself too seriously ( althought it is serious ). One plus point is the fact that the narrator doesn't step on a soapbox to preach and condemn, he just...narrates and observes.   However, after the first half of the movie is over, it suddenly dulls and painfully slows down from the pace from which it begun. For starters, the attention to detail lowers, the dialogues start to dumb down, you get this ""anything can happen now, no matter how far fetched"" feeling, and plain and simple, it just gets silly. As in ""6th sense"", another recent movie, there a ""shocking"" twist near the end. But instead of leaving you gasping for air like in the former, here it all seems contrived, forced, it just doesn't fit. All in all, Fight Club is not a bad movie, but I really wished it had ended as good as it started...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" all style, no substance
",,"Just came from a sneak preview of this movie, Edward Norton was nice enough to bring the movie to his alma mater, Yale University, but unfortunately it doesn't live up to the preliminary hype, or to the quality of his other work. The problem here isn't acting- he is still good in a demanding role that merited top billing(rather than being put under Pitt), and the rest of the cast does admirably as well, although Brad Pitt has played a role much like this before(see 12 Monkeys) and Helena Bonham Carter's role is pretty much as demeaning to women as it gets. Jared Leto and Meat Loaf, yes, Meat Loaf, are also in this movie, although you may not recognize Leto with a badly scared face or Meat Loaf with breasts(no, I didn't stutter). This film owes a lot to The Game, David Fincher's last movie, in that it ends up with a complex plot that is solved a little too easily and non-logically- I won't destroy the film by explaining how exactly, but the movie basically builds up to a climax that just doesn't resolve much, and then resolves that with a further illogical ending. The laughs along the way are not for the faint of heart or those who don't appreciate black comedy, but they are the highlights of the film, from the odd humor of Norton and Carter being addicted to help sessions for diseases they don't have, to Pitt's interesting use of liposuction byproducts. There's never too much appeal to the violence of the movie, but the combination of nihilism and comedy doesn't send the movie into mediocrity. It's when the movie turns serious that it starts to turn sour, as the plot twists out of control and a strange comedy turns into just another movie in the Seven/The Game/The Matrix genre of stylish, mindless violence without much purpose, point, or original plot. The script shows elements of literature that may have just been better in the original book, but otherwise, this is a movie with not much going for it except its cast. Answering questions, Edward Norton joked about how working with Brad Pitt was easier for him because he could always rag on him about Pitt's bad movies- ""Whenever he'd get on me, I'd just have to say 'Cool World'""- and also said he thought he had yet to be part of a ""stinker"". This may just be his first, and Pitt's latest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" It stinks!
",,"Boring, quasi-philosophical violence-feast. The plot is dumb, the ""surprise"" twist is not surprising, the dialogue is stiff and lifeless (with lines like ""What you´re feeling is premature enlightenment""). Furthermore, Helena Bonham Carter isreally, truly miscast. How can anyone like this movie? (I know a lot of people do, but I just cannot understand why).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I am Jack's kick-ass review
",,"To be honest with you, when I saw the title of the movie, I thought it was going to be another mindless action film.  But then something happened.....I actually watched it.  I thought the movie was genius.  It wasn't so much about fighting.  It was more about schizofrenic office worker that suffered from insomnia.  Brad Pitt, the star of the movie, played his character (Tyler Durden) flawlessly.  Throughout the movie, Ed Norton's character (the narrator) was trying to fight his inner demons which were preventing him from getting any sleep.  With the help of several small terrorist groups, a disturbed female that pretended to suffer from testicular cancer, and Tyler Durden (a self righteous psycho), the narrator can finally resolve his problems.  I feel I would have enjoyed the movie much more had not my brother spoiled the damn ending before I watched it, but even without the surprise ending, Fight Club still makes my top 10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Totally a baseless crap
",,"This movie doesn't know exactly what it wants. The movie is very slow on pace. I actually like the kind of movies that first try to build the characters and make you delve into the atmosphere. This movie wasn't building any character or atmosphere but what it was building is total BOREDOM.I didn't want to watch this movie till the end but then I thought about the high points that people have given it and some of the reviewers were talking about its great twist ending. But the ending alone couldn't save the 90% of this movie's boredom.I really feel cheated, I want my money and above all 139 min of my life back that I wasted on this crap.My advice to you people who haven't seen this movie please don't waste your valuable resources on this crap.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Wretched and Unforgivable
",,"This is one of the most Unpleasant Films you are likely to see. Making you Squirm is perhaps one of its 'Charms"" and part of what makes it a Teen Favorite.This is an Ugly Thing, both in Tone and the way it Looks. It starts out with a lot of Unsightly Stuff. Like the Victim Self-Help Meetings where we have to look at a Homely Woman, about to Die, looking to ""just get laid one more time before it ends"" and Meat Loaf with Huge Man-Breasts drooping to his waste being hugged by Ed Norton while exchanging Affection and Sweat.That's just the beginning. It gets a lot more Repulsive as things go along their Merry Way. We have the Central Conceit and Title of the Movie, that Place where Lonely Guys meet to Beat and Bond. Then things really get out of hand with a Zombie Squad and a lot of Speechifying about the Evils of Capitalism, Consumerism, and Zen Stuff like ""when you own your possessions they own you"" and other Well Worn Witicisims that might have been Insightful a Thousand Years Ago.If you are a Fan of those Bare Knuckle Cage Matches, Guy Ritchie Movies, Neo-Nazis, or Anarchists Anonymous, this may be Entertaining. But it can also be a Pseudo-Intellectual, Inane, Disturbing Diatribe that is not Cathartic, just a Vile, Witless Waste, Pretending to be an Ultra-Cool, Post-Modern Philosophical Guidepost for the New Millennium. The Film is Objectionable, Hideous, Unsightly, Overrated, Trashy, Dumbed-Down, Unforgivable, and Absolutely Awful. The Stylish, Talented Director can not be Forgiven for this Wildly out of Control Poisonous Picture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" I am Jack's love for Fight Club
",,"As my movie-buff persona started growing, I decided to find out what movies were everyone's favorites. I looked at IMDb's top 250 and I was familiar and unfamiliar with some of the films on that list. I decided to watch some of the films on that list and I wanted to watch Fight Club first because it just attracted me in ways I can't explain. Watching Fight Club was an amazing and great experience. The movie is about 2 hours and 30 minutes long, but for me, it actually felt like the whole film was an hour and a half long! One of the many great things about Fight Club are the acting. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt have oscar worthy performances in this film, and they are very different and unique characters. Helena Bonham Carter has very good acting in this film as well, and her and Brad Pitt are the funniest things in this movie. This film is probably one of the best dark comedies ever. The camera work in this film is outstanding. The zooms, the wide angle shots, and every frame in this film is beautiful. The ideas that Brad Pitt's character expresses are very thought provoking, and proves that this film has the style and the substance as well. The soundtrack is very catchy and the editing is also praise worthy. The twist (that I won't spoil) is also executed in such a creative way, it is one of the best parts of this film and it gives this movie rewatchability. I showed this film to one of my family members, and she said that the film was satisfying. I actually 100% agree with her because all of the lines that are said and the things that happen in this film all add up and gives out the sense of satisfaction. Fight Club is one of David Fincher's best films, and it is probably one of my top 5 favorite films of all time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" ""This is your life.""
",,"I am Jack's review of the movie Fight Club. If you don't know what that means, it's just a small taste of how sardonic this whole film is.At first, I assumed Fight Club was just a movie about a bunch of guys beating each other up. From the moment it starts, however, it proves to be much more than that. It's actually a very strangely neurotic and mesmerizing descent into a testosterone-fueled madness. Actual fighting is limited; what you get instead is a storytelling experience that's so warped, it will challenge your perception of what is and isn't real in the film. The film itself even gets warped, with such bizarre effects as having single frames of images mixed into random spots, and one frenetic scene where the negative appears to come undone. Throw in some wild computer-generated modelling effects and some brisk editing, and the film becomes a highly stylized and entrancing experience.The story is a real doozy. It kicks off strong and hard, showcasing the insomniac protagonist and chronicling how he went from being an average office worker with everything into a deviant with nothing (and nothing to lose). Things get thrilling when the actual fight club takes off and anarchy starts to spread, but the main focus is always on exploring the characters, and it all builds up to an unpredictable climax. There is a massive plot twist in the mix, but it's one of those that holds up extremely well on repeat viewings (even though it can be a little hard to believe). Characters shine really well, thanks to their nuanced performances, their sharp dialogue, their convoluted relationships, and the nature of the plot, which really makes us stop and think about what's going on in their heads.There are a number of themes that can be extrapolated from this crazy story. The most blatant messages concern anarchy, as the characters constantly criticize the modern consumerist culture and emphasize ""letting go."" Much of the story is really about them abandoning the common goals of wealth, success, or material things, and just being yourself. There are moments where the film also seems to dig up deeper metaphysical questions and meaning, especially regarding morality and the perception of reality.As noted above, the film has one heck of a style. The camera work is very solid and good, while the editing tends to be very inventive and wild. Acting is great; Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter are effectively perfect in their roles. Writing is awesome, and there are tons of great lines. This production uses some very great and detailed-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. Music by the Dust Brothers can be a bit nutty, but is mostly pretty awesome.Fight Club is a movie with some serious attitude and style. The experience of watching it is like going through that feeling of wooziness after being punched in the face, for it is that trippy. I could say more, but the first and second rules of Fight Club forbid me...5/5 (Experience: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Most Immature Movie I've Ever Seen
",,"(Preface: I really think I was careful enough with my words to avoid any spoiling, but if vague descriptions count as spoilers to you, don't read on.)Let's face it - it's all about fighting - gruesome, stupid, uncivilized, uncultured, immature fighting. If you are a caveman, go ahead and like this movie. If not, then I am sincerely grateful for your existence in our world.On a side note, despite the plot holes, I figured out who Pitt's character was since the end-of-the-apartment scene. I'd be interested to know if anyone else was able to predict the same thing.The very end of the movie falls under the same category as the body - immature, shallow, and useless. I just gotta say it - this is my least favorite movie of all time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" This movie was not made for me
",,"I have read other reviews of this movie, and I think that my outlying, grossly negative opinion, may have something to do with the fact that I do not identify at all with this movie.  I am proud to say this.  It is sad that so many people did see something of themselves in this movie.  I feel truly sorry for you.It was obviously never this movie's intent to be entertaining, or to make you care about the characters, humanity, or society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Its majesty Figh Club
",,"I've read few 1 star rated comments of FC and I got amazed how people who dislike this movie enjoy trashing and insulting people that find it masterpiece... I didn't like it at all first time I've seen it and if I knew about IMDb then, I'll surely give it 2-3 stars. But when I've seen it for the second time (even if I wasn't keen of it, friend made me) – all bits and pieces came in their places and I've realized that this is the best movie ever made. Unlike most movies today, this one makes you think. You may enjoy it without being anarchist, whore, drug addict, uneducated, aggressive, neo Nazi and everything else that caring 1star givers classified us. It's their problem they want from movie to be linear, classical thriller, to have logical plot, believable characters etc. It's their problem that only conclusion they can come up with is that ""this will make stupid people that are on the edge, to blow up buildings and deliver pain"" or ""it portrays sadistic violence, anarchy and terrorism in an appealing light and attempts to make it seem intelligent; instead of what it is insanity"". If it isn't sad, it would be funny...People can't make difference between satire and critics on the one side and glorification on the other side... Fight club is wonderful and poignant critics of the world today and 8.8 rating tells me that most of the people got it right. For all the others – too bad for you that you're not able to see it's excellence...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""Fight Club"" requires a lot of viewer trust and patience, but the reward is a very fine movie.
",spoiler,"""Fight Club"" runs a bit over 2 hours. For the first 1 hour and 51 minutes I found this movie very difficult to watch or enjoy. I kept wondering why Ed Norton's character continued to put up with Brad Pitt's out-of-control character. To me the movie seemed to be one big mess. However, my patience, and trust in the director, paid off and I had to watch much of the movie twice to really appreciate how good it is. I rate it 9 of 10 and predict it will be one of those ground-breaking films that viewers and critics refer to for years, much like ""The Matrix"" and ""The Sixth Sense."" It is definitely for someone with a mature mind, who can understand subtleties, and who enjoys ""studying"" a film. This film is definitely meant to be a funny and absurd take on life, but with a very dark tone to it. It isn't really about ""fight clubs"", although the fighting is presented as an avenue for characters to deal with their inner conflicts. It is not intended to represent reality, nor to suggest that fighting is good. It's closest prior film is perhaps ""Doctor Strangelove.""I saw this film on DVD. The sound is perhaps the best I've heard so far. There are several crashes and explosions throughout the movie and the realism is just so good it made me cringe. But you have to have a good subwoofer to enjoy it all.Now - CAUTION - SPOILERS FOLLOW - READ AT YOUR OWN RISK.However, I think most people will enjoy the movie more, on first viewing, if they understand the total concept. So here it is.Norton plays the ""narrator"", and in the introductory scenes we find out he has a conventional existence, a traveling job as a ""recall coordinator"" for a major automobile manufacturer. By his own admission he is ""a slave to the IKEA nesting instinct"", travels with his ""CK shirts and DKNY shoes"", and says of his total existence ""close to being complete."" ""Fighting"" is completely foreign to him. But, deep in his subconscious he hates what he is becoming, and if he were to die now his life will have been meaningless.Brad Pitt's character, Tyler Durden, is Norton's alter-ego. They are one and the same person. In opening scenes you see various single-frame flashes (stop-action on DVD helps see this clearly) of Pitt's 'Tyler', we assume still in Norton's subconscious as he first begins to realize he hates his existence.Then, on a buisness flight, while talking to the lady seated next to him, Norton thinks ""I pray for a crash or midair collision"", which is quickly followed by a highly realistic ""dream collision"", then Pitt's Tyler Durden the rest of the trip is actually sitting next to Norton, conversing with him. This ""prayer for a crash"" is the consciousness that first makes Pitt's Tyler totally real to Norton.The rest of the movie has many scenes with both Norton and Tyler but, we see later, no one else ever sees Brad Pitt's ""Tyler"", they only see Norton as ""Tyler."" Brad Pitt's Tyler is explained this way, ""You were looking for a way to change your life. You could not do this on your own. All the ways you wish you could be - that's me. I look like you want to look... am free in all the ways you are not. Little by little you're letting yourself become - Tyler Durden.""The movie's title is unfortunately misleading, because only a small part of the movie is really about the fighting, which is used as a way for disillusioned men to get out their frustrations. One line by Norton, ""This kid from work, Ricky, couldn't remember if you ordered pens with blue ink or black. But Ricky was a 'god' for 10 minutes when he trounced the maitre d' of the local food court"", explains the gist of why they fight. It symbolizes the one area where they are in complete control of their pleasure and pain.That last comment, ""maitre d' of the local food court"" illustrates the comedic approach to much of the movie. Who ever heard of a food court having a maitre d'? How much lower in the food chain could you get? Or Ricky supplying ink pens at work? One of the fight club ""assignments"", to pick a fight with a stranger, then lose"", has a number of very funny sequences in it.The movie turns very dark when the fight club kicks itself ""up a notch"" and begins to plot the destruction of all major buildings housing credit card companies. The rationale - destroy them and all their records of debt, and everyone can start again at ground zero. When Norton's Tyler finally at 1 hour 52 minutes into the film finally figures out what he had done, he tries unsuccessfully to twarth the plan. The final scene shows him and his girlfriend standing before a window in a high-rise, and sequentially all bombs go off and the buildings crash into various piles of rubble. Reminiscent of the final scene of ""Doctor Strangelove"", where all the nuclear bombs are going off, destroying the world.The closing line, Norton says, ""Everything will be alright. You met me at a really strange time in my life."" Again, dark humor.The genius of this film, if there is any, resides in the premise that the two main characters represent the two extremes of the same person, and in the end the ""real"" Tyler Durden meets them in the middle. Once you know this premise, and can watch the whole movie in this context, I found it much more enjoyable, made much more sense, and every scene with both Tylers is done completely in character with the premise.The DVD also has a second DVD which is devoted to extras which are in themselves very interesting if you like to study the art of film-making. However, plan to spend a minimum of 5 hours total in viewing and studying this film to get its full impact.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Very, Very Ordinary
",,"Well it was a nice story, and so realistic. I'm sure most normal humans are pretty keen to take on an existence such as the one portrayed in ""Fight Club"". Surely the percentage of people in this world don't enjoy fighting. Fight Club made this out to be one of America's favourite pastimes. I've spent significant time in the USA and never saw one fight.It was a dull and boring movie, and I suggest Eddie Norton takes a good hard look at himself before being involved with a script like that again. Helena too. As for Bradles, after accepting a part in ""Legends of the Fall"", nothing surprises me with his movie selections, even though the boy has talent. I feel this was more like some kind of hardcore modern fairytale as opposed to a realistic society pastime.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Good that it tries something different. Bad that it fails.
",,"Yes, this movie is quite different. However, aside from the possibility that no one's done it before because they weren't smart/inspired/good enough to, there's also the other one.  This is a movie that fails so remarkably, you almost have to be a genius to come up with such a failure.In the one excellent scene in this movie, Edward Norton, flying on a plane from one of his constant business trips cracks a joke to his neighbour, Brad Pitt (aka Tyler Durden, here). ""very clever."" Pitt replies ""how is that going for you?""That is both funny and poignant. The rest of the movie, however, is neither. In fact, it's just the same as poor Ed Norton - too clever for its own good.Worse yet is the reaction this movie seems to cause. Many of the others commented (and other people who've seen this movie) think that Tyler Durden is somehow the voice of good, a positive role model, if you will. And some people are completely nuts about this movie, they quote it day and night and I don't know, it's just weird.And then there's the ending. I can't give it away, but the best thing that I can say about it is that it is gimmicky. It's also pretty implausible, doesn't fit with the rest of the story and involves blowing up skyscrapers (something we now know is not a very good idea).If you're going to make a clever movie with a clever surprise ending, fine. It's possible to make a good one - The Usual Suspects for example. But having a clever movie that isn't clever enough to make sure the movie still makes any sense when the ending is revealed? A clever movie whose message is how empty cleverness is? A clever message movie? Where the message is delivered by someone who's obviously, shall we say, not very emotionally/mentally stable, to say the least?I guess you could say it's irony, but then with the same success you can say that ""Domestic Disturbance"" is a movie that makes one think 'cause it makes you think what the heck you're doing watching/paying for such an awful movie.Having said all that, this is a movie that could have been partially rescued by having a lead actress who is stunningly beautiful. Unfortunately, Helena Bonham Carter isn't.Okay, maybe it's not the most overrated movie on IMDb - after all ""The Shwshank Redemption"" is ranked #2 and ""Kingpin"" is not even on the bottom 100 at all. But it's pretty close.1/10. And that high only cause it took so much effort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Overrated by wanna-be intellectuals
",spoiler,"SPOILER!!! This is one of a few movies overrated by wanna-be intellectuals. The script is slick in that it disguises its propaganda. Propaganda you ask? Lets start off with the FACT that Edward Norton's character in this movie is psychotic and Brad Pitt's doesn't exist. Brad Pitt's character Tyler Durden is a figment of Norton's imagination because Norton's character is psychotic. This whole plot twist becomes even more aggravating when you realized you wasted over two hours watching a movie about a psychotic anarchist. The movie's message is great for impressionable kids; the system is against you so how to succeed is through violence in some cases terrorism. Please, spare me the rhetoric. I realize the movie is fiction but it does not excuse it. Even fiction should entertain; this just drags you down into the sewer and gives impressionable misguided kids bad ideas. Sort of what the Clock Work Orange did for racists and neo-Nazis.The people who watch this need to realize that for every person or corporation in society that is corrupt there are a large magnitude of corporations and people that are not. Society in general and Capitalism are not bad. Far from it, in society today whatever is bad is used as propaganda to generalize everything as bad. This movie does the same. It conveniently keeps out any opposing arguments for its purpose. Which is to portray sadistic violence, anarchy and terrorism in an appealing light and then attempt to make it seem intelligent, instead of what it really is - insanity. Capitalism is what has given the west it's high standard of living and life expectancy. No other economic system offers this prosperity.People are always searching for tips in life or tricks they could use because they do not have an imagination themselves. Movies like this are candy to someone with no imagination. Forensic science could easily determine if someone beat himself up or whether your boss did but then you blow the plot of this whole movie because where would Norton's character get all his funding? Instead some will feel they have a ""new"" way to black mail their boss, how pathetic. So much of the movie is laughable when you analyze it. Did I mention Tyler Durden, I mean Edward Norton's character intimidates a mobster? Please.This movie attempts to be smart and that is why it fails. Smart people do not punch themselves until they bleed, live in abandoned decrepit buildings or perform terrorist acts. Smart people also do not waste their time watching dumb movies like this over and over. They read books, go to college and learn how things really work. The fact that movies like this are popular is a sign society is failing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

If you haven't seen it...See it! If you HAVE...See it again! In the weeks after its release, either the critics just plain DIDN'T GET IT...Or shrewdly pretended not to! Considering Fight Club's tauntingly in-your-face Political INcorrectness, it's easy to see why most critics opted to play it safe! Here is a film that almost cries out, ""HATE ME! DESPISE ME!"" An occasional film will step gingerly on the toes of audience sensibilities. Fight Club drop kicks them! Yet, it is so relentlessly and quirkily original, so pathologically tantalizing...you will LOVE it...and then HATE yourself for it! Make no mistake, however, Fight Club always shows its audience ample respect. It never pontificates nor proselytizes, as would your typical formulaic Hollywood film.The term ""Ride"" is employed so freely to movies today, that it has become rather meaningless. Fight Club re-invents the word! Literally, from the DNA Roller-coaster opening Credits (Accompanied by the DUST BROTHERS musical equivalent of a sustained amyl-nitrate rush!), to the metaphoric wailing (""We're still men!"") of castrated testicular cancer victims, to the mesmerizing and deftly parlayed 3-way screen chemistry of Norton- Bonham Carter-Pitt, to the sharply focused pointlessness of our cruise- control, hyper-consumeristic lifestyles......Fight Club synthesizes both our pent-up frustration and our self- induced reluctance to communicate it, in RULE #1...""You DO NOT talk about Fight Club!"" This, Ladies and Gentlemen, is one ""RIDE"" you DO NOT want to miss! 10*.....ENJOY/DISFRUTELA!

" One of the Best Films Of All Time With a Perfect Script
",,"Fight Club is directed by David Fincher and stars Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Jared Leto. Edward Norton's character, known only as the Narrator, is living a depressing life. His day job is behind a desk, and he accompanies himself by buying things that he doesn't really need in order to find fulfillment in his life. He begins attending support groups for conditions that he doesn't have, in order to feel relief through expressing his pain to those who have it worse.Once Bonham Carter's character, Marla Singer, begins showing up to these meetings, he begins to feel remorse in his life again. However, once he meets cool guy Tyler Durden (Pitt), he, along with Tyler, start a ""fight club,"" a place in which men who seek fulfillment may find it through beating each other up. Once things with both Tyler and Marla begin to get a bit shaky, our Narrator must fix his own problems without the help of others.It's very rare to find a film in which you completely love everything about. In my humble opinion, however, Fight Club is easily one of the best films ever made. With its eerie direction, fantastic acting, and more than compelling characters, Fight Club is as close as it gets to perfect, with no issues to be found in it. The flawless script contributes to my liking of this movie, due to amazing dialogue and great detail upon the current setting.If anyone has ever read the script for Fight Club, it's just shy of 200 pages, and that is magnificently impressive. The detail the script goes into is purely astounding, and the lines are written, and performed, perfectly. The script, written by Jim Uhls (and based off of the novel by Chuck Palahniuk), is incredibly written in near every way, with great in depth depictions of how each shot was to be set up, and how the actors were to perform their lines.The direction, by David Fincher, is exemplary, with great camera angles and surprisingly memorable shots. The shot I remember most particularly is when Tyler Durden is delivering the final rule of fight club (that being the eighth), and the camera zooms on the side of his face, passing his head and spinning quickly to the next shot of two men fighting. Every single shot, like the one just mentioned, is brilliant, excellently pulled off by Fincher.The characters, combined with the talented acting behind them, is also very unique. Although the Narrator is supposed to be a boring everyday man, the viewer cares for his situations deeply. Throughout the film, he breaks the fourth wall multiple times, and this adds a very personal level the caring for him through the entire run time of the film. Norton plays this character wonderfully, thanks to his great acting abilities. The character of Tyler Durden is easily one of the best, and coolest, characters ever put to film. Every line that Pitt delivers as Tyler is flawless, and deserves all the recognition that a character, and his actor, could ever receive.The other characters, such as Bonham Carter's Marla, Meat Loaf's Bob, and Jared Leto's Angel Face, are also amazing. The audience quickly sympathizes with everybody in the film, thanks to great acting and dialogue. Once again, the script's lines are written and delivered flawlessly, with each actor giving his or her line ideally. Each character is well rounded, and has a great arc throughout the run time of Fight Club.The pacing of Fight Club is also astounding. An almost 2 hour 30 minute film goes by as if the story is told in 20 minutes, and flies by so quickly. This is mostly due to the quick, yet detailed, script, and fantastic direction. Both Fincher and Uhls make this movie zoom by, as if no time has gone by at all. Each of the actors also contribute to this aspect, ultimately making the film feel very short.The last thing I'll mention is the plot twist. Without spoiling anything, Fight Club has one of, if not the, best plot twists in film history. Everything throughout the film sets up for the twist, yet we, the audience, don't pick up on the clues when watching the film for the first time. Fight Club is a rare type of film in which contains a better experience watching it for the second time than watching it for the first. The twist is perfectly built up to, and flawlessly executed in every way.Overall, Fight Club is one of my favorite films of all time, and I like to say that it's one of the best movies ever made. I'd recommend Fight Club to anyone that can handle violence and language, because it's truly worth anyone's time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fincher's best film along with Se7en
",,"""The first rule of Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club""I will go ahead and break the rule and simply talk about Fight Club; the 1999 film that I recently added to my favorite movie list. In my opinion this is one of Fincher's masterpieces along with Se7en. David Fincher has made some great films, but none have ever rivaled his work in the 90's with these two films. Both Se7en and Fight Club are among my favorite films and consider them superior to Fincher's other great recent films like Zodiac, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button, The Social Network, and The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo. Fight Club is an extremely violent film, but I don't think it's gratuitous because the movie really works as a satire and raises several philosophical questions about how enslaved we've become under the capitalist and advertising system, but it also points out the danger of anarchy as well. We've become materialist beings finding our purpose in our possessions and have left out the spiritual part. Sometimes we need to feel pain to remind ourselves that we are alive, and in a way this film works as a highly crafted metaphor. I loved the way the story was presented and how this surrealistic film worked. Based on Chuck Palahniuk's novel of the same name, and adapted for the screen by Jim Uhls, Fight Club is a masterpiece thanks to Fincher's direction and the performance from the excellent cast which includes Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helen Bonham Carter. I really loved this movie from beginning to end, including the twist in the final act. 1999 was the year of great twists considering this is when The Sixth Sense was released as well (my all time favorite film). Fight Club is a must see film for all.The movie begins with a scene where the narrator (Edward Norton) has a gun forced down his throat by Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), to which the narrator begins to tell the viewer what has led him to this point through voice over narration, and so the film is told in flashback. He takes us back to the days when he was an office worker who experienced severe insomniac problems. The doctor recommended that he visit a support group with men who have suffered from testicular cancer in order for him to really see the pain other people have gone through. Despite not suffering from this condition, the narrator decides to do so and discovers that going to these therapies allows him to finally being able to sleep for the first time in months. After this, he decides to attend a different support group every night and everything seems to go well, until he discovers a manic depressive woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who is doing the same thing he's been doing: jumping from one support group to another. Seeing her as an intruder and a liar, the narrator can no longer find peace in the support groups and so his insomniac problems begin again. His life will change dramatically when he meets Tyler Durden, a soap maker, in an airplane and has an interesting conversation with him. They exchange numbers and when the narrator arrives home from the airport he discovers his condo has been blown up. He then decides to call Tyler and ends up moving in with him at an old abandoned complex. The two start a very different support group which they call Fight Club since they have to fight one another. The movement becomes popular and little by little they begin to form a revolutionary movement known as Project Mayhem, but things begin to escalate too fast and dangerously. Edward Norton appeared in the big movie screen during the 90's and this was when he made his best films (American History X, Primal Fear, The People vs. Larry Flynt, Rounders, and Fight Club), although I would have to argue that his best performances were in American History X and The 25th Hour. However he is still excellent in this film as well. Brad Pitt is at his best playing the sort of chaotic and anarchic character who in some ways is similar to the narrator, but in others very different and more dangerous. He has a strong pull on Norton's character and influences him deeply. Helena Bonham Carter also plays one of her best roles as this sort of manic-depressive character who stands her own ground in this mostly male dominated film. The performance from the cast is one of the best things about Fight Club which works in every level. The visuals and special effects are also fantastic. It is a dark film with a lot of violence mixed with satire that had me laughing quite a bit. I absolutely loved this movie and the ending was just brilliant.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" My most favorite movie
",,"almost 10 years have passed and I have not seen better movie than this. Many people are mistaken when they think that this film is all about fighting and nothing more. The truth is that it contains the most interesting and useful moral as you can learn in any other movie. In a few words the moral is that a man can obtain freedom (and therefore happiness) only when he/she has given up his needs and fears, that most of us are living according to society standards, living according to the style that we hate and in front of which we are actually made ourselves dependant. I have seen it more than 10 times and always noticed new ideas which are worth to think about, and most of viewers, who watch this movie many times, have said that they experience the same experience. I have also read Fight Club book and honestly and liked the movie better - this doesn't happen often - David Fincher did excellent job - the film has very unique and accordant style without exaggerations and the crew was very successfully build, actor play is faultless, there is nothing you would want to change.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Brilliant. Masterpiece. Soap.
",,"Fight Club. What can you say about Fight Club. It's awesome? Not enough. Brilliant? Not there yet. Should've won Academy Awards for Best Picture, Director, Actor, Supporting Actor, Supporting Actress and Adapted Screenplay? You're on the right track. Stay with me and I will run you through the whys.Why should it have be nominated for Best Adapted Screenplay? Not just because it was adapted from a novel written by Chuck Palahniuk, because it spoke to a generation that understood all the philosophical bullcrap that came out of Tyler Durden's and the Narrator's mouths. But the philosophical bullcrap actually makes sense and shows perfectly each character's state of mind.Why should it have be nominated for Best Supporting Actress? Helena Bonham Carter was the only person who could've played Marla Singer. No one else could have acted as perfectly in the role as she did. As probably the only main female character in the film, she performs just as well as the rest of the male cast.Why for Best Supporting Actor? It should need no explanation. When you finish watching Fight Club, what do you remember most about the film? Brad Pitt. As Tyler Durden, he is more than perfect. He is the spokesperson for rebellious outcasts, a role that has done many times before, none as good as Pitt who immerses himself into the role. Slick, cool and crazy, it is undeniably one of the best performances of all time.Best Actor? Edward Norton matches Brad Pitt's performance with the key component of subtlety. Norton gives the performance of his career as the Narrator, a guy who has taken so much crap, he doesn't really give a damn. His performance as the Narrator tops his other brilliant performances in Primal Fear, Red Dragon and even American History X.Best Director? Fincher took Chuck Palahniuk's twisted novel and twisted it even more to make a world of his own vision. Without Fincher, this movie wouldn't be the same. It wouldn't be the same cult classic that a lot of people come to love and worship.If you put all of these element's together, you get Best Picture. A story of violence, philosophy and soap. Fantastic direction, amazing cast and a brilliant screenplay put the pieces together.There you have it. Also, kudos on the editing and the music.Fight Club ****out of****.Rated R for Strong Graphic Violence, Language and Sexuality.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The film of an entire generation... masterpiece
",,"If someone has told you that ""you need to see this movie,"" then they're not far off. They're probably in their 20s or 30s and lived through that time when Starbucks was the next big thing, companies were starting to ditch dial-up for DSL, Casual Friday was the only motivation they ever had to live through the week, and their parents were too busy getting divorced to force them to go to graduate school.When it comes to periods within these eras of self-reflection, satire movies like Office Space come to mind. However, Fight Club goes a step beyond and then some, taking a look at how this lifestyle obsession invades every aspect of life, sinking into our personal lives, making it impossible to find a woman who doesn't despise your guts outside of the physical side of your relationship, where being clever and funny are the only things you have to keep yourself sane, and where a generation of MTV-raised, Saturday morning cartoons, post-Reagan politics, Hollywood-worshiping, McDonalds and 7-11 Slushees men are being turned into demasculated raving psychotics trying to find any escape from their misery.Fight Club comes along at a time in history where it's perfect. We have our narrator and his miserable insurance salesman life with a job he hates buying all the useless crap he doesn't need to fill his apartment to satisfy himself with what he thinks makes him perfect and socially acceptable. He becomes so sick of himself that he seeks any escape. He finds hope in support groups for men with testicular cancer and starts to regain his sanity, only to have his hopes shattered when he finds another faker in the group... a woman. Things spiral out of control when he finds a strange soap salesman on a business flight and starts to take great interest in his life. He then leads him to a path to hit rock bottom, to live among the dregs of society, redefine his masculinity and prove it to others. What begins as a weekend hobby soon collapses into a downward spiral of complete and utter destruction and a seemingly hopeless struggle to put the pin back in the grenade.The film contains line after line of brilliant writing and takes twists and turns where you least expect. Every character is acted perfectly and not a frame of film is wasted. Some have claimed this as quite possibly the least predictable movie to ever come out of Hollywood. I would completely agree. However, this is not its only strong suit. Fight Club incorporates elements from almost every genre: drama, horror, thriller, action, suspense, mystery, and romance just to name a few. It tackles so many subjects and has so many messages it's really hard to know what to look at first. This is one of those movies where everyone has a favorite scene and no one has the same favorite quote. A film that speaks for an entire generation of men and the future of our lifestyle obsessed society, Fight Club is an all-time favorite for me and I would recommend it to absolutely anyone. Just sit down and watch with an open mind and you will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Lame
",,"I won't try to write an outline of the film, others have done a good job of that here already, I'll just confine myself to observing my own reaction to it: This is one poor movie. Due to the buildup I expected something pretty good. My enthusiasm went progressively downhill as I watched the story develop and when Ed Norton performs the revealing scene (Which I suppose I should not describe here) I felt like pulling the tape out right there, I was that insulted. I am struck with jaw dropping amazement at the vote results here in IMDB. What possible value does this movie have to place it higher than so many great films in the top 250 list? I have a feeling that this flick speaks to the 16 to 21 year old male (the same group that the worlds armies traditionally love to make eager immortal uncritical soldiers from). I would like to see a demographic breakdown of the registered voters in IMDB. I get the impression that a hoard of enthusiastic male youths flooded the IMDB with high votes immediately after the release of this puerile tale. Oh well, if you want to vote this sloppy trash highly, knock yourself out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" OVERRATED!!!
",spoiler,"SPOILER ALERT I recommend that anyone who appreciates originality and creativity in cinema, not watch this movie. Multiple personalities is the most crappy, overused plot device ever. I know that that is the book's fault, but why make a movie out of it. While Norton and Pitt make great performances, who cares considering how atrocious the story and script are. The weak low rent parlor tricks like blips of brad pitt in the frame don't just make the movie look cheap and low rent, they break the continuity of the film as watchable art. Why people like this movie when the ""twists"" are so unnatural, forced and illogical I have no idea. This is nothing more than just a high budget student film. A high budget C- student film at that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Visually stunning, conceptually brave and only the odd sag
",,"Our narrator is a white-collar worker who has his life to a point it could be called normal.  His home is decked out in the pornography of IKEA catalogues and he is professional.  However he is somehow dissatisfied with his life as it is and drifts from various support groups faking disease just to get love and emotional outlet.  A chance meeting on an airplane with soap salesman Tyler Durden gives him pause and, when his flat is destroyed in an explosion, he turns to Durden for help.  Together they begin to move into a world that isn't commercially based, where pain helps them to feel more alive.  Together they start a small group called Fight Club where men can experience the thrill of a fight without the danger.  However the groups grow rapidly and begin to carry out subversive activities at large.  When confronted by our narrator, Durden disappears our narrator in charge of a semi-cult group that is operating without his knowledge.I didn't get round to seeing this film until it came to TV in the UK recently.  So over several years I had generally been told that it was a `great movie'  mostly by people who had HEARD it was a great movie rather than those who had seen it.  So I expected greatness and was taken a little aback by the fact that this wasn't a normal Hollywood film but something much more worth while.  The reason I'm surprised that it ranks so highly and did so well is that it requires concentration and thought.  The plot is basically a comedy, making fun of us.  That's how I saw it  that we are like the narrator but we must accept that this is our lives to some extent, to go to the other extreme is just as bad if not worse.  It is a very clever story and it only dipped in quality at one point for me  where the clubs first begin to become something more sinister (more!) and move into terrorism.Part of the reason it was so well watched is the stars but also the very cool direction that made it stand out to the student generation as something deep (even if they didn't get the film).  I think this ironic as they haven't hit the stage of our narrator and can't fully relate.  However the direction is praise worthy and Fincher was the best man for the job.  Full of clever shots and great images the film is a joy to see.  The one flaw I had was the sincerity of the film.  Many love it because it is anti-capitalist in nature, making fun of IKEA-love etc.  The film is preaching to us about this (and the other) extreme  but most people watching and making it will be living that exact life!  However this is minor and it became less as the film went on and mocked both ends of the scale.The stars do well and I wonder if they worried this would be too highbrow and flop?  Norton is simply a great actor when given the material and he delivers here.  Even with the more extreme actions (that aren't real) he carries them off as convincing.  Pitt enjoys himself well in the joint lead although his character is basically one dimensional (for obvious reasons). That said he is very strong and takes you with him as he gets more extreme. Carter is a weak link to me and I never really bought her character.  A shame as she is quite central but it doesn't spoil it too much.  Support cast are good, but putting a face like Meat Loaf in a very unusual role just made him stand out and distract from the role.Overall this is an excellent movie.  Even if you don't get it, it is still great fun to watch.  It is a brave story to try in a Hollywood film and it is superbly directed, acted and told.  Some may rave about it too much but it is well worth a look.  If only out of interest rather than to change your life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" the poor vicitimized upper-middle-class white man?
",,"Despite the clever crafting of this film, it is basically a complain-fest about the poor upper-class privileged white male blaming all his woes on Ikea. Is this the extent of self-proclaimed victimization that is taking over American culture? Disturbingly to any intellectuals, this movie's amorality passes itself off under the guise of reason -- as if the central character has a logic to his rage and subsequent violent decisions -- as if the poor young white businessman who's been educated well and raised in an upper middle class lifestyle with all the benefits really is some sort of victim of retail stores. Is it really proving a coherent point to blow something up? It's even more upsetting to think about this after seeing 9-11 take this film's logic into reality...is the point of this movie to say that American commercial freedom SHOULD be attacked? With all the sexification and glamorizing of violence, and its poor-me ranting against consumer products (rather than taking responsibility for one's own commercialism or participation in it), it's hard to find a redeemable net-sum to this movie. Ed Norton is, as always, terrific. Brad Pitt very good in this role too. And I very much appreciate the filmmaker's talent, but I wish he would use it for something that was thoughtful.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club and Calvin and Hobbes
",,"WARNING! SPOILERS FOLLOW. I saw Fight Club a month or two back, and was kind of unimpressed with it. It was a decently made film, with good acting and good directing... but something about it just didn't quite work for me. That is until I began to examine it more closely. Then I realized what it really is: It's not a life-altering drama or a vicious black comedy, as it is proclaimed to be... rather, it is a cleverly disguised attempt to bring one of the greatest comic strips of all time to the big screen. That's right, Fight Club is really an adaptation of Calvin and Hobbes. Just take a look at the similarities... Fight Club: The Narrator (hereinafter ""Jack"") feels depressed and alone, which leads to his fabricating Tyler Durden, a friend and companion who is everything Jack wishes he could be. Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin has no friends, which leads to his projecting everything he wishes he could be into his stuffed tiger, who becomes his friend and companion Hobbes. Fight Club: When Jack looks at Tyler, he sees Tyler. When anyone else looks at Tyler, they see Jack. Calvin and Hobbes: When Calvin looks at Hobbes, he sees a tiger. When anyone else looks at Hobbes, they see a stuffed toy. Fight Club: Jack simultaneously detests Marla and desires her. He projects his desire through Tyler, though in several scenes we see this desire in Jack himself. Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin simultaneously detests Susie and desires her. Throughout the course of the strip, we see this desire manifested in Hobbes. But in the very early episodes, Calvin expresses the same desire himself, if only to himself. Fight Club: Jack expresses his dissatisfaction with his father, and the job he did as a parent.Calvin and Hobbes: Calvin frequently speaks of his father doing poorly in the ""polls"". Fight Club: While at work, Jack is under the thumb of a demanding boss, whom he does not like. Calvin and Hobbes: While at school, Calvin is under the thumb of Miss Wormwood, a demanding teacher whom he does not like. Fight Club: When frustrated with the world around him, Jack goes to a place in his imagination (that place with the penguin) where all around him things are serene. Calvin and Hobbes: When frustrated with the world around him, Calvin goes to places in his imagination, where he is Spaceman Spiff, Tracer Bullet, Stupendous Man, etc.So, thus we see that, though Bill Waterson himself forbad the filming of his strip, a few brave men had the courage to go behind his back and do what they felt was right. Never has there been such a courageous act by filmmakers since the days of Nosferatu, which was another thinly-disguised attempt to bring a beloved character to the screen... Count Chocula.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Disappointing
",,"After having my little brother and friends hype the heck out of this film and claim it to be the greatest thing since sliced bread this came as a disappointment. There were too many boring stretches for me and not much in the way of story. It was like a (no pun intended) one-punch joke that fell flat about 30 minutes into the film. Brad Pitt was good, if out of place. Ed Norton delivers his dialogue as if he were asleep and comes across as a second-rate John Cusack wanna-be. Helen Carter is funny in parts and Meatloaf is just hilarious. Thumbs in the middle for this one. This movie fell flat at the box-office as struggling 20th Century Fox (and this is NOT a bad thing) tries to come up with fresh ideas to lure the teenage audience, without having to recycle 30-year old science-fiction films.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The director and the director of photography also did a wonderful job...I love the scenes in the abandoned buildings...They add to the darkness of the film. This film is unmatched in it's performance and in a class all by itself. The gritty film noir type has been copied, but never duplicated. The dual personality of the lead actor was delivered wonderfully as was the supporting actor. Brad Pitt delivers a stellar performance and makes us believe there is actually another person in the movie when there was not.

" A Bizarre Love Story
",spoiler,"1999 has been called ""The Year that Changed Movies."" The Matrix came out that year. American Beauty. The Virgin Suicides...And Fight Club.""And suddenly I realize that all of this, the gun, the bombs, the revolution, has got something to do with a girl named Marla Singer.""***SPOILER ALERT***So much has been talked about the rebellious aspects of the film. The fight clubs, the liposuction soap, the subliminal messages, the narrator's insanity, Bob's bitch tits.But I just want to slip on my horn rimmed glassed, pour a glass of scotch whiskey, and talk about something not everybody seems to like, but what makes this movie art, not just entertainment: The deeper meaning.Which, it seems, I gather, seems to say, the correct way to live is neither the soul-numbing safety of a consumer lifestyle, nor a reckless rejection-of-comfort-for-the-sake-of-feeling-alive Anarchy. At the end of the movie, the Narrator chooses his love for Marla over Durden, and decides on the middle road: enough recklessness to fall in love and fight back against the police when he has to, but not to the point of complete Anarchy, which would put Marla's life in danger.There's a famous quote that goes (I think) ""Anarchy is no place to raise a child."" Or maybe I just made it up. I don't know, at the moment I'm feeling rather unreliable. (narrator)The movie is structured like this: everything that happens on screen between the Narrator having a flashback spurred by the thought of Marla, and Marla Singer being dragged up to the top story of the corporate office building by members of Project Mayhem exists completely inside the Narrator's head. It is a blend of memory and imagination. According to literary/film precedence (The Catcher in The Rye, Lolita, Memento) a story can be distorted by the unreliable narrator as long as it is being told by the first person narrator, and not a 3rd person POV. The narrative aspect of the film is what makes the plot twist at the end acceptable to the audience. If the film was not a narrative, if it progressed in a 3rd person POV, it wouldn't have made any sense to show Brad Pitt's character. The narrative aspect also allow the film to move along much more quickly, which is necessary when there is so much material in the narrator's brain. The action of the film spans several years, and is really 3 mini-stories wrapped around the core thread of Marla Singer/The Narrator's love story:Act 1. SUPPORT GROUPS. The Narrator's life changes from an Insomniac/Recall Coordinator/Consumer to an anonymous member of support groups for the dying, until he meets the 'big tourist' Marla Singer.Act 2. FIGHT CLUB. The Narrator creates and imaginary friend (Tyler Durden) who he doesn't realize is imaginary, and then acts out Tyler's destructive impulses: he blows up his apartment, starts fight club, makes soap out of liposuction fat and sells it back to the people, splices single frames of pornography into family films, and has sex with Marla Singer. Act 3. PROJECT MAYHEM. The Narrator's imaginary friend takes the revolt against consumer culture to its polar opposite: Creates Project Mayhem out of Fight Club. Project Mayhem has the subversiveness of Fight Club on a massive scale: its aim is to return human beings to a primitive, earth-based existence through anarchy. The Narrator fears for Marla Singer's life, turns himself in to the police, and finally shoots himself in the face, effectively killing Tyler Durden. (For now.) All for Marla Singer.The narrator is forced to choose between love and destructive impulses, (between Tylar and Marla). He chooses Marla, effectively killing Tyler. The End.Yep. Sorry Guys. Fight Club is a love story.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" In a year of amazing films, this one always stands out for me.
",,"Whenever I talk about different years in movies, I always pick 1999 as my favourite year. So many amazing films came out such as American Beauty, The Green Mile, The Matrix and Being John Malkovich. Out of every movie that came out this year, one stands out for me and that is Fight Club.The first time I ever watched this movie was really late at night and I had waited for it to come on T.V and had to wait until everyone was asleep. I was in absolute awe over the sheer brilliance of the film. everything about it is amazing.The first thing I noticed was the cinematography. Every time I watch this movie, the opening shot gets me excited and ready for a powerful film.The story itself is so interesting, it doesn't have any dull moments. Even when a character's life is portrayed as boring you are just hooked in wanting to see what will happened next. The way the story develops also is very fascinating.Then we have wonderful performances from both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. But I think that the real standout here is Helena Bonham Carter.

",,"first of all let me tell you this is the first time ever i am writing a review so if there are any minor mistakes please don't bother. when i searched for the best mystery thrillers on IMDb i first found this movie on that list, when i searched for the best dark comedies, again i found this movie there, and when i searched for best crime thrillers, there also i found this movie, but its name ""fight club"" suggests action, so i was wondering what is this movie actually about so gave it a try and trust me this movie has everything action comedy suspense crime just everything. not even for a single second i felt bored watching this, right from the first frame you will be into it, and that climax twist was just mind blowing, i really did't except this movie will turn out to be such entertaining. really a grate movie well directed good acting and i still don't understand why this movie did't get an Oscar!!? i highly recommend it to all those movie buffs over there and i tell you, without ""fight club"" any of your movie collection is incomplete.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" 110 Minutes of Pure Greatness, but alas...
",,"Fight Club is one of the greatest movies movies of all time... through the first 110 minutes. The film is about a man who has become a corporate slave, he sees no value or meaning in his life anymore. Because of this he goes to support groups in hopes that the pain of others will enable him to feel something, anything at all. The movie lays out a story that is entirely believable, considering people's tendencies of overworking, and the isolation many people feel in this modern world. Perhaps in the not-so-distant future people will feel the need to beat the hell out of each other to feel alive and connected. So far, in the film, you have grown attached to the characters and are immersed in the reality of what could be. The ending, ah the ending. The first 110 minutes of this movie are rated a 10/10 in my book, the last half hour or so brings the final rating down three points. The ending fit perfectly into a movie that was science fiction based. However this doesn't work. This movie bases its entire story around the idea that this kind of thing could really happen. The ending throws everything out the window. By the time this movie is over you might feel cheated, and rightfully so. To have science fiction like ending to this movie is almost as bad as making an entire movie a dream, you cannot do it! Salpping that ending onto this movie makes the entire thing feel pretentious and phony. Many will tell you that this is not the case, and that I just don't appreciate the twist at the end. To formulate your own opinion, well you will just have to watch this for yourself. Good luck and, please, give me some feedback.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Sorry I watched this
",,"I was not going to watch this movie because the pre-views did not appeal to me and I am probably the only woman living who does NOT think that Brad Pitt is sexy. However, I have heard several people tell me what a good movie this is and more than half were women. So, it came on cable and I decided to watch it. At 2 hours, I turned it off and I was sorry that I waited that long. I kept hoping that it would get better. I understand the ""materialism is bad"" theme. I also understand the concept of Ed Norton's character having everything but feeling so lonely and depressed that he starts fight club with Brad Pitt in order to get attention and feel wanted. What I don't get is after starting the fight club, why start making bombs and blowing up buildings? So, the point that I get from this movie is that it is OK to start and/or join terrorists organizations because someone is unhappy, pathetic and generally miserable with their life. I guess that all the folks that found this movie appealing and humorous, did not have friends or love ones in the World Trade Towers or the Pentagon. Because, wasn't it a bunch of unhappy, miserable, materialist-hating people that bombed both of those places?The only thing that makes me depressed are movies like this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" This film changed my life.
",spoiler,"Where to start? It's been nearly ten years since ""Fight Club"" was released. I saw it for the first time in about four years yesterday. I still find it both truly inspired and truly inspiring. Some of the themes and concepts that the film explores have become even more relevant in this day and age.Why? This is the film that crystallized a great deal of pain, rage and emotion with a great deal of viewers, including myself. When I first saw this, I worked a job I hated for a phenomenally racist and homophobic person, I'm not gay, but I'm semi-intelligent, speak politely, like foreign films and alternative bands. Therefore, people with small minds judge me as a result.""Fight Club"" taught me to be true to myself. It was also one of the first building stones that lead to me quitting the profession in which I worked. Not probably the normal reaction, but the scene where Tyler says to the bodega worker that if he comes back and sees him working the same job made me start crying.This film and Darren Aronofsky's masterpiece ""Requiem For A Dream"" helped me to find the courage to change my life in so many different ways and to embrace this life and live it to the fullest.For that, I say thank you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Are we that snobbish? (spoiler)
",spoiler,"I remember reading somewhere that Mr B.Pitt said that the significance of this film would be appreciated by people of next century.What does that mean? And who makes him the expert on people's thought in the next century? All I hope is that he should be born in the next century,so that I don't have to see his face and hear his name all the time while I am alive.I am feeling increasingly that we as movie-goer are becoming snobbish all the time. It seems, nowadays movies are intended not for you to watch,but for you to interpret.Then, instead of taking coke and popcorn into cinemas, we should have a notebook and pencil at hand.What this movie is all about,I don't know.And I am wondering how many of you people out there DO know what it is and why it is so ""great"".Are there really so many extreme situations and times in our lives? If it is,then staying normal should be viewed as something abnormal.After all,what is wrong with the ordinary men's life and feelings?Shouldn't movies display these instead of showing people the extreme cases all the time?As to Mr Norton, I have but just one feeling:truly admiration.Of all the movies I have seen him playing, he is always suffering from a split personality.He must either be a complete nuts or the toughest guy alive,psychologically.And what is funny about people's high appreciation of him is that there must be so many of you who are living experts on abnormity of personality, otherwise how can you truly appreciate a thing weird as that.Honestly, I HATE movies like this.It's so called ""taste""only makes people snobbish.To me,it is far more noble to go to a movie,because you want to see a certain actor or actress,then because you are told this is one ""DEEP"" movie by those sick film critics.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Pretty Good - But Not Great
",,"This movie has been hailed by many (mostly men) as the greatest movie of all time. It has been continually rising up the ""Top 250"" and now ranks as the 10th best on IMDb.I'm sorry, after 4 viewings, I still do not get to that level. I don't think I ever will.I have read many of the reviews and I agree with most of the positive comments and do not agree at all with most of the negative reviews. The movie is not dumb by any means. It is not an experience in testosterone driven world of violence. It is anything but a mess.It is a very well written, extremely well directed, view into a dark anti-consumerism world.The movie's message is recognize consumerism and reject consumerism. As such, it presents the conflict between two characters Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt and someone who is called Jack, Rupert or Cornelius and who is played by Edward Norton.Jack is quite a consumer, or at least at the start of the movie he is. There is also Marla Singer played by (Helena Bonham Carter), who is both like Tyler in most ways and like Jack in other ways.Tyler is basically against everything society values, and virtually anything positive. He argues with, and eventually begins to win Jack over to his thinking. At one point, he fights Jack and the two of them create fight club. Tyler also has a sexual relationship with Marla, despite the fact that his friend Jack can't stand to be around her.The movie has a good and memorable twist. The movie is loaded with numerous unique and memorable quotes. Most of the quotes are very negative. The movie is extremely intelligent and every frame of the movie is meant to be in the movie for some reason. The Director, David Fincher is Fantastic.If we desperately needed a movie against consumerism: this is it! Here is one of the quotes: ""You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet.""If we needed a positive movie or a positive message or to learn something positive, or something that at least makes us feel good or feel uplifted in some way, This is not it, and This is anything but it.Here is another one of the movies' unique quotes that gets shouted more than once:""You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world."" Here is another line that someone shouts: ""You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.""If you like dark negative movies, this is a good one. If you want to be uplifted, this is not your movie, it's Jack Movie as the DVD tells you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" #10 in the IMDb top 250.....really?
",,"Having just watched this film, I honestly can't believe it is ranked in the top 250....let alone in the top 10! Don't get me wrong this film was good but I just can't see why it is rated so highly. If there's only 9 films supposedly better than this then I have lost all faith in the IMDb rating system.After all I had heard about this I was expecting an absolute classic, which is what it is being classed as. With that expectation it fell horribly short. For me this is just worth a one time watch and is a decent 7/10 movie at best.I thought this was supposed to be FIGHT Club, well there was very little fighting or action. The drama was good and did keep me gripped for quite a long time but then when the twist came it was just stupid. Maybe it's just not for me.7/10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" How did this movie get in the top 250?
",spoiler,"POSSIBLE SPOILERSLooking at the subject lines of many of the reviews, I see phrases like ""pure genius,"" ""brilliant,"" and ""a work of art.""  This movie is not brilliant, it is not a work of art, it is a train wreck, pure and simple! There were so many interesting ideas introduced in the beginning of this film, but somehow they fizzled along the way.  The idea of a group of men trying to fill the void left by consumer society was interesting.  Then, Project Mayhem, a cult-type operation where none of the members can think for themselves, which seems to contradict the theme set forward by the first hour of the movie.  The movie changes from an intelligent satire to your standard action/suspense flick, with a little psychological suspense and quirky romance thrown in for good measure, Tyler Durden spouting philosophy the whole way through.  This movie did have some very good cinemetography and editing, and it was very quirky and high in shock value, which seems to be enough to get most people to overlook its inherent flaws.  I can only hope that a few years down the road, people will be able to see this movie for what it truly is, a movie that could have been great, but somehow blew it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Good that it tries something different. Bad that it fails.
",,"Yes, this movie is quite different. However, aside from the possibility that no one's done it before because they weren't smart/inspired/good enough to, there's also the other one.  This is a movie that fails so remarkably, you almost have to be a genius to come up with such a failure.In the one excellent scene in this movie, Edward Norton, flying on a plane from one of his constant business trips cracks a joke to his neighbour, Brad Pitt (aka Tyler Durden, here). ""very clever."" Pitt replies ""how is that going for you?""That is both funny and poignant. The rest of the movie, however, is neither. In fact, it's just the same as poor Ed Norton - too clever for its own good.Worse yet is the reaction this movie seems to cause. Many of the others commented (and other people who've seen this movie) think that Tyler Durden is somehow the voice of good, a positive role model, if you will. And some people are completely nuts about this movie, they quote it day and night and I don't know, it's just weird.And then there's the ending. I can't give it away, but the best thing that I can say about it is that it is gimmicky. It's also pretty implausible, doesn't fit with the rest of the story and involves blowing up skyscrapers (something we now know is not a very good idea).If you're going to make a clever movie with a clever surprise ending, fine. It's possible to make a good one - The Usual Suspects for example. But having a clever movie that isn't clever enough to make sure the movie still makes any sense when the ending is revealed? A clever movie whose message is how empty cleverness is? A clever message movie? Where the message is delivered by someone who's obviously, shall we say, not very emotionally/mentally stable, to say the least?I guess you could say it's irony, but then with the same success you can say that ""Domestic Disturbance"" is a movie that makes one think 'cause it makes you think what the heck you're doing watching/paying for such an awful movie.Having said all that, this is a movie that could have been partially rescued by having a lead actress who is stunningly beautiful. Unfortunately, Helena Bonham Carter isn't.Okay, maybe it's not the most overrated movie on IMDb - after all ""The Shawshank Redemption"" is ranked #2 and ""Kingpin"" is not even on the bottom 100 at all. But it's pretty close.1/10. And that high only cause it took so much effort.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Not even the slightest bit entertaining.
",,"I don't know about anyone one else but when I watch a film I have one goal, to be entertained.  I can say without any reservation I was not entertained for even one minute during Fight Club.  What really shocks me is that this film is rated so highly.  Apparently so many who have watch this film find the bizarre so appealing.  To me a film is good when it's entertaining. You know, enjoyable to watch.  I found nothing even remotely enjoyable about this film.  Fight Club is nothing more than a film about dysfunction and LOTS of it.  Bizarre hallucinations and violence.  Is this thought provoking or intelligent?  Sorry, I don't see that.  My recommendation, if you're a person who looks for true entertainment in a film look elsewhere.  I am definitely worse off for spending 2.5 hours on Fight Club.  I give it 1 out of 10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The plot twist kills the film.

A good contrast is with ""Sixth Sense;"" the twist makes you look back at the film with even more interest. You may even want to see it again.

" Fight Club, our life...
",,"Although the movie was released in 1999, I watched this movie just recently, since I don't like that kind of movies with fights and violence. Even if a friend of mine told me about this movie I still was circumspect about it.At first I was confused, and I thought this will pass. Later in the movie, I was more confused, but not disappointed, anyway. Just at the end I understood the whole thing, making me more confused. I had to watch it over and over again to make sure I understood it right.""Fight Club"" is not about violence, is not about that kind of ""fight"". Is not about anarchy or destruction. Is about knowing yourself, is about your capability to understand and structure your own actions, is about being aware of yourself.It's a great movie, which describes the philosophy of life: live your own life, don't live the life of others.

" Literally the greatest Movie ever
",,"My favourite movie of all time, gets better with every watch and better than the book its based off of. Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and David Fincher at their best. The cinematography is beautiful every frame carefully crafted. Both the video and audio editing is top notch, the sound effects couldn't have been better unless u were actually there and even then they wouldn't be as good. The action is shaky cam free with some of the most brutal fight scenes ever put to screen. The atmosphere is perfect both a visual pleasure and brings perfect atmospheric tone. the story is enthralling and the less you know about it going in the better.

" Masterpiece
",,"This is a superb movie on so many levels. Sometime movies get mixed reviews from critics due to the concepts or themes portrayed, or lack of understanding of a complex plot - that is exactly the reason here.If you are thinking you are going to see movie that just involves people kicking the crap out of each other, you would be very wrong. It is so much more than that.Just go and see it! The undertone attacks the society we live in today - consumer driven and unrealistic expectations. It also has themes of violence but at the same time has elements of black comedy.The acting throughout is superb - great performances from the 3 main character played by Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helena Bonham Carter.***Spoilers*** You may have to watch this movie several times before you fully understand it and pick up on all the nuances but I outline some below.When I first saw this I thought there was something wrong with the DVD because at a few points is seems to flicker (and does) not until I put it on super-slow motion did I realise it was intended. If you slow it down you can see it's his alter-ego starting to form. Not only is this alone brilliant but later on it is revealed that Tyler working at a movie theatre does the same thing - edits movies to insert just a frame or 2 - something you notice but are not entirely was there (like when I first saw it - as I said I thought there was a slight DVD fault). Extremely clever.When he is beating himself up in his bosses office he says ""for some reason I thought back to my first fight with Tyler"" why? Because it was exactly the same situation.How could a fight club possibly form? If you see 2 guys fighting in a parking lot you aren't exactly going to join in - but if you see a crazy guy essentially fight himself you could conceivably approach to see what is going on.When Tyler is banging Marla he speaks to Ed Norton and then slams the door, Marla says ""who are you talking to?"" we get to find out. There are many more instances like that, the film doesn't cheat but when you find out the incredible twist you aren't expecting it.The palette used is superb - bland, subdued, fitting in perfectly with mental illness. Then you get Brad Pitt, looks striking, blonde hair, unusual outfits - He doesn't fit in at all - again, we get to find out why. Superb.The themes about modern society are absolutely bang on too if you think about them. Are you rich and famous? Weren't we lead to believe we could be? Do we need most of the things we clutter our lives with?These a just a few things, there are so many more things you will notice, when you see it again and again.Like I said.

We think a movie can have certain limitations on its effect and direction but this movie shows you how awesome and well-directed a movie can be. This movie is about male aggression, not just aggression, it is a wrong word, it shows how much non-alive we are. So a guy starts fight club to have some sort of aliveness in a person. He is a visionary man, tyler durden, who has a plan and an entirely different approach to the modern generation. What follows is a roller coaster ride and a one which you wont possibly forgot till you die.The acting is brilliant and so are the one liners.Even before the ending you are tightly gripped by this movie and i assure you at the end you will be overly surprised.

" Fight Club: an Aristotelian look
",,"There's no doubt that Fight Club is one of my favorite movies. Its attractive and original style, its trapping story, its performances, its ending and its message turn this sequence of images with sound into an authentic masterpiece. I consider this film to be one of the best of all times. Fincher tells us the story of an unnamed character (the narrator) who has entirely devoted to his job and whose life completely lacks of meaning. This guy, who is very well interpreted by Edward Norton, suffers from insomnia and can't find the solution to his problem. He becomes addicted to attending support groups and pretending to be a victim, which at first seems to be the cure to his sleeping disorder, but the presence of another impostor named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) ruins everything; Norton starts feeling uncomfortable. The narrator meets the man who is going to help him solve his problem, Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Durden will try to open Edward's eyes; he will teach him how to leave everything behind, how to forget about the material stuff in order to discover the meaning of his life. They will co-found an underground club known as Fight Club. This film is the story of us, the story of everyone. This is a love tale that, camouflaged by a critic to capitalism and consumerism, talks about the pursuit of happiness, talks about finding the right person, the person that takes out our best selves. It is a story that strengthens values such us compromise, conviction, devotion, determination and love.

" Best of 1999...
",spoiler,"1999 was such a great year for film!! I mean ""The Matrix"" ""American Beauty"" "" Run Lola Run"" ""Toy Story 2"" AND ""Fight Club""! Out of all those films I mentioned Fight Club deserved the Oscar for Best Screenplay, Directing and Picture over them by a landslide!!This has to be one of the greatest films I have ever seen. It really forced me to think of the point of life and whether like them I need some crutch( for them it was Fight Club) to make me feel alive. I really think that Fight Club deserved the honour of an Oscar way more than American Beauty, and just because of that it obstructs my ability to enjoy American Beauty.The whole storyline is very original and entertaining at the same time. It kept me glued to my seat, waiting to see how ""Jack""(played by the amazing Edward Norton), if you will, would handle the whole situation. I love the fact that they put little flashes of Brad Pitt in scenes for like a split second before ""Jack"" is aware Tyler. This film was created by a very meticulous director and it really shows that he paid attention to every little detail. The ending was such a shock, for a moment I was thinking I don't know how this movie could get any better, and then they put in that HUGE twist;also because of that twist the movie is even more enjoyable the second time around, and the third time and the fourth time.Another thing I liked was that Jared Leto played Angel Face, I thought it was pretty funny since I remember him in "" My So-Called Life"" and now that he is the band 30 seconds to Mars. I just thought that was pretty cool, especially cause I didn't recognize him at all.Anyways, Fight Club is a great film, definitely the best of '99.

" Highly Overrated!!!

I knew this movie had a cult following and after finally watching, I'm trying to understand why. Maybe if I watched it several more times, it'll grow on me, but I have a feeling I won't for quite a while. It wasn't all bad. It did have some decent and funny moments. I liked Helena Bonham Carter's character. The middle half of the movie was probably the best, but it went down-hill for me when the 'fight club' basically turned into a cult and the weird twist involving Brad Pitt's character. Edward Norton stars as a traveling automobile company employee who suffers from insomnia. He's known as The Narrator because he visits support groups to see how other people suffer. He eventually meets a woman a lot more miserable than him named Marla Singer. After his apartment explodes, he calls up Tyler Durden, a man who he befriended on a plane. They slowly start a 'Fight Club' where guys meet up and just beat each other up. If you like movies that are supposed to be considered 'great' you might enjoy FIGHT CLUB!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Incredible movie about life, fighting, and masculinity/femininity
",spoiler,"Fight Club's simple title, aptly chosen by the author, betrays the extremely relevant tones that the film conveys. The film, one of the better adapted movies from a novel, offers social commentaries so scathing and obvious that they will most likely force you to reconsider your daily routine and lifestyle.Possible spoilers.The movie's main character, quite appropriately, has no name. He is instead referred to by the pseudonyms that he provides while crashing various self-help groups. His motive for doing so, insomnia, serves as the focal point for the film's plot. The narrator/main character, while seemingly asleep, actually becomes the founder of a national organization of everyday people who defy society in multiple ways: picking fights with innocent people, setting up underground fight clubs, and even destruction of corporate symbols. The main goal of the film is to take society's clichés and stereotypes and reexamine them, hoping to decipher the truth about why we have so quickly and wholeheartedly embraced them. The places this movie takes you will shock and astonish you in several ways. The plot is only increased by the perfectly appropriate and understated performances of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, respectively. One movie that everyone should watch once before they die.10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The people that don't like this movie generally fall into 2 groups
",,"The people that don't like this generally fall into 2 groups: Those that approach it believing its central theme is fighting and those that think it is shallow and represents everything it claims to be against.9 out of 10 people fall into the 1st category and feel let down when they realize that fighting encompasses a relatively small amount of the movie's content. They are what I classify as ""mouth breathers"" or the ""lowest common denominator"". They are incapable of ignoring their preconceived notions of the movie's theme and unable to judge the movie on what it really is. To them, it is a disappointment that they saw a completely different movie than they expected, and it is therefore sub-par in their narrow little world.The other 10% see the themes and story for what they are, but feel it's over-produced and ""too stylish"", something the movie purports to outright protest. What is lost on these poor souls is that was the exact point of why it is the way it is. It makes fun of itself, all the while protesting our modern culture. It's the ultimate self-deprecating humor.I know there are others who don't like the movie for a variety of reasons, but these are generalizations and are, therefore, generally true. There are exceptions, but these are what the majority of negative feelings for this movie encompass.To me, this movie is clever and full of great, dark humor. The violence these men engage in is the same kind of self-destructive behavior that ""cutting"" is for young women. They both feel numb to the world and cutting or fighting is the way they have chosen to ""feel"". Of course it's not a healthy way to address these emotional crises, but the movie uses it as a way of illustrating the lengths to which people sometimes go in their search for a cure to their despair.I enjoy watching this movie over and over again. It's one of the few movies that never gets boring no matter how many times I see it.10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" One of the best films of the decade and also one of the most important
",,"The first time I saw ""Fight Club"" I despised it. I found its message stupid and contradictory - it was a hypocritical film that preached against violence yet was more violent than any other recent films including ""The Matrix"" (which is not quite as realistic as ""Fight Club""). I saw it again on television a few years later and thought it was a bit better and not quite as horrible, but still didn't enjoy it much.However I was convinced into buying the DVD and seeing it again just because it had been rated the 37th best film of all time on IMDb (it's now #41).Well I'm happy to report that I found ""Fight Club"" utterly brilliant on third viewing. Since then I've seen it more than a handful of times on DVD and it just gets better each time. Brad Pitt gives a fantastic performance as one of the coolest cinema icons of all time: Tyler Durden (whose name is a reference to Travis Bickle of ""Taxi Driver"" - according to something I read the first name is harsh, the last name simple and soft).Edward Norton gives an Oscar-worthy performance as The Narrator, ""Jack,"" whose actual name isn't ever truly revealed. (Many people don't seem to notice this.) I won't go into the plot and won't go into a deep analysis because so many other people have done it so well. Suffice to say it IS a very violent movie but I find its style infectious and David Fincher's direction wonderful. It is a brutal and weird film and sometimes it is a bit too pretentious and clever for its own good - I won't lie and say that it's flawless and I totally understand why so many critics bagged on it for being ""a laborious dog"" on its initial release. The British DVD includes a mocking pamphlet where the filmmakers brag about how they all knew it was going to be great from the start and I think this is a bit too masturbatory - the fact that they include critics' negative reviews as a mockery is humorous but childish, and I can understand why some might view ""Fight Club"" as a very childish, contradictory film. (After all, I used to think the same thing.) However I really have come to love it despite its flaws. I think Tyler Durden is one of the absolute coolest characters of all time and Pitt plays him so well it's scary. Norton embodies the Bored Working Repressed Everyman flawlessly. Fincher is great behind the camera.And the film's message strikes a chord nowadays when I watch it - it is a bit contradictory and some of the violence really isn't needed, but then again I'm not going to complain because I've never really cared too terribly much about violence in films so I'm not going to start now.Overall this is one of the most important films of the 1990s and its message was missed by a lot of people (myself included) back in 1999. In a year of some really good movies ""Fight Club"" was probably the best and is one of my all-time favorite films.It's easy to see how this might be considered the next ""Taxi Driver"" thirty years from now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The first rule of Fight Club is to watch Fight Club!
",,"I watched this movie along with District 9 on a long car ride. I approached both the same way I approached the 1986 version of The Fly: is this going to be so disgusting I'm going to barf ten minutes in? Luckily, like The Fly, both movies were incredible, and Fight Club was definitely the better of the two. The plot tells the story of an insomniac man (Edward Norton in his best role) who wants to improve his life. He gets that chance when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt in one of his best roles), an increasingly insane soap maker who creates the fight club of the title. Finishing off the terrific team is director David Fincher, whose work includes Se7en, The Game, and The Social Network. Without giving anything away, the 3/4 mark of the film gives us a MAJOR unexpected twist. After finishing the movie, I didn't know what to make of it. Five minutes later, I knew this film was a modern masterpiece that deserves its place at #10 on the top 250 list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""My life is unfulfilling, what should I do...?""
",,"Ed Norton character: ""I don't know. I'm just not content with my life. I have a job that doesn't do anything to benefit mankind. I have so many possessions, but they don't make me happy. I just feel there must be more to life than this shallow, commercial, material world I live in. I want to do something different.""Me: ""Well, it's very commendable of you to re-evaluate your priorities. So, since you don't like your material possessions, are you going to get rid of all your IKEA furniture and move to a smaller apartment, one that you actually feel comfortable in?""Norton: No.Me: Well, since your job isn't fulfilling, are you going to quit and join the PEace Corps, or get a job as a teacher in an poor neighborhood?Norton: Nah.Me: Well, since you're looking for some higher meaning to life, are you going to start going to church?Norton: Nope.Me: Sigh... okay, so what ARE you going to do?Norton: I think I'll get together with a bunch of other unfulfilled guys, and then we'll beat the snot out of each other.
**If that strikes you as profound, well, then ""Fight Club"" is the movie for you. If it sounds ridiculous (and it should!), avoid it like the plague.The ironic and amusing thing is, most of the fanboys who rave about this movie are geeks who couldn't fight their way out of a paper bag, and would run crying to their mommies if someone even LOOKED like he was going to throw a punch at them!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" It takes one to know one
",spoiler,"The movie is about an ordinary guy, who leads an ordinary, drab life trying to rise above his position near the bottom of the corporate ladder.  You soon find that he is an insomniac.  Later, you find that he also has another personality.  His other personality is an anti-establishment, anti-consumer, anti-God, anti-everything, uninteresting psycho.  The movie centers around this psychotic idiot creating an army of even stupider low-lifes to do his bidding, which includes destruction of and creating chaos within our established social system.  The fight club is the army, and it began when men decided that they got a wonderful ""release"" by inflicting and receiving pain during fights.  What a wonderful idea for a movie!!  If you are a complete manic depressive psycho idiot neo nazi, that is!  This movie is over 2 hours long, and it is a shame because in my busy life I just lost over 2 hours of my weekend.  I kept waiting for the movie to show me its purpose.  This is the absolute worst movie I have ever seen.  I guess the writer relates to the characters.  I am proud to say I do not.  And if many people do relate to the brainwashed psycopaths in this movie, then society is in big trouble.  This movie can only accomplish 2 things:  Waste your time, or convince really stupid people that are on the edge, to blow up buildings and deliver pain.  I walked away from this movie angry that someone could spend $50 million making it.

" Impossibly overrated and unsettling
",spoiler,"Edward Norton and Brad Pitt form a very strange bond that seems, at times, like it has strong sadomasochistic and gay undertones. They both get off on fighting and at times there seems to be a very odd chemistry between them. During the course of their friendship, Pitt shows Norton how to be more and more and more bizarre and wrapped up in a weird hobby they created, the ""Fight Club"" where testosterone-hyped idiots experience the joy of beating each others' brains in so they can prove their manliness. However, as the film progresses, the club becomes more like a club for anarchists and Norton begins to question where they are headed.This is a movie that had lots of interesting little touches and twists. However, in many cases, they were very cool but also didn't particularly make much sense. The last 20 minutes of the film in particular is really cool--but it just doesn't make sense psychologically and seemed more interested in wowing the audience instead of ringing true. Because of this, I felt that this cult film is impossibly overrated--especially since it's now #25 all-time on IMDb! I won't spoil the surprises, don't worry but suffice to say that by the movie is finished you have absolutely no idea what actually happened.As a high school teacher, I also was alarmed that this film actually encouraged the growth of a sick subculture. A group of boys in my school started their own ""fight club"" and took great pleasure in proving their manliness. I guess if they didn't get off by hurting each other UFC-style, they'd have to ""prove"" their manliness by shooting bunnies or some other mindless guy way--but I hate to see that supposedly civilized people LIKE the idea of watching others become hurt.Additionally, the film is packed with some of the most brutal violence you'll find on celluloid and there is tons of nudity, sexuality and terrorism--just the sort of stuff you'd never want your teens to watch. Unfortunately, among teenage boys, this film is practically a ""must-see"". Parents, exercise some common sense and keep this nihilistic and cruel film away from your kids. If you want to see it yourself, fine, since you probably WON'T be tempted to imitate it. Kids will---I can attest to that.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

There was some amusing satire in here, but you had to wade through a lot of adolescent posing and prosing to hear it.I am commenting only because I think this tawdry junker needs a counterpoint to its unmerited adulation.

" An exceptionally poor film
",,"A day after the experience, I am still trying to reconcile how the man who was responsible for the magnificent subtlety of ""Seven"" could create such garbage.  Yes, the violence was gratuitous and excessive, but oddly enough that was the least of this films worries.Where to begin?  The plot was ridiculous on it's face, absolutely incoherent and nonsensical.  The various themes of the movie were amplified and remarkably shallow, showing no real insight into the problems of our society.  Ours is an overly commercial culture?  This is neither original nor especially interesting, especially when repeated ad nauseam.Fincher's direction and sophomoric MTV-style presentation did nothing to help a script that never got any further than ""live free or die"" (with minor variations).  Most of the dialogue reminded me of something my high school English teacher used to say when her students ventured out of their league: ""That's so deep it's shallow"".  This succinctly describes the handling of every major theme in the film.Then there are the performances.  Edward Norton, an otherwise gifted actor, does little with the simplistic character he's given.  There is no complexity to this character whatsoever and Norton can do nothing to help define him.  His early attempts at playing the neurotic are particularly unconvincing.  Brad Pitt has more to work with in the Tyler Durden character, but his tendency to overplay absolutely everything about his character (even beyond what the script calls for, or should have called for) makes Norton's performance seem that much more vapid.  Helena Bonham Carter simply showed up; throughout the movie, one had the feeling that she desperately wanted to be somewhere else.  It seems hard to blame her.Had this been the work of any number of other directors I could name, it would be easy to dismiss the overheated message of this film.  Fincher is capable of such subtlety and craftsmanship that it is hard to believe he could put his name to such a juvenile, simplistic film.  One hopes that ""Seven"" is not the only thing of beauty we see from Mr. Fincher.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Horribly Overrated

Its only redeeming quality is if you take it as an examination of mob mentality in a group of reprobates - except in that light, its quality ends up seeming like someone's final project for their high school psychology class (as in, amateurish and not very detailed).People talk about its ""depth"".  My answer to that is, ""What Depth?"".I have no problem with its premise - people are dissatisfied.  Hey, I could handle ""The computers that rule the future can build a nearly-indestructible attack robot out of liquid metal"" in Terminator 2, dissatisfied people is nothing.  Even the incorrect placement of blame is believable.What bothers me, though, is that the movie attempts to pass itself off as an accurate portrayal of the real world.  I'm not saying there aren't people like that.  What I'm saying is that they aren't right.  They aren't automatons, they're unambitious.  They aren't ""suppressed by an overly-materialistic society"".  They're just whining and looking for someone else to blame for their problems.  I have an easier time believing Marx's nonsense about class identity than I do the things this film tries to pass off as ""meaningful social commentary"".Fight Club doesn't have a social message.

Even the soundtrack is lukewarm and sounds horribly dated (some ""brothers"" or someone). Norton is the kind of actor whom you either can or cannot watch (I haven't totally decided yet), Bonham Carter still delivers a phoney stateside accent (Woody Allen obviously hasn't helped), and Pitt only looks good in his eye to eye hotel room sequence with Norton (anyone who claims they see him as a good actor is either lying or is deluded - the guy just looks good with cropped hair). Other than this we're looking at a film made for awkward teenage boys who can't watch it anyway cause it's mostly rated 18. It's the slightly older awkward boys who sadly do get to see it and end up slobbering over it and writing rave reviews about it.

" An overrated film by an overrated director based on an overrated book by an awful writer
",spoiler,"I can't go on. No, I will go on. Fight Club represents one of the worst films I've ever encountered inasmuch it aims for intelligence and subversion but winds up wide of the mark. It's gimmicky and trite and all together pointless. I didn't enjoy it when I first saw it, and now I despise it because some people have elevated it to the level of a masterpiece. Those people are wrong. In trying to address violence in American culture (at least I hope that was the film's intention), the movie fails entirely. It does nothing to subvert the brutal violence on screen or address it in any meaningful manner. Look at Sergio Leone or Sam Peckinpah; they made often violent films that pique the audience's bloodlust only to ultimately undermine that desire for violence. Leone built up the tension and then refused to show you the gore you wanted; Peckinpah slowed it down to the point that the violence became unbearable. Fincher may have wanted to have the same effect on his audience, but he doesn't; the violence in Fight Club is enjoyed by the audience and they keep wanting more. It explores the lure of violence to a degree but then backs off this more thoughtful approach in favor of simply showing the violence. There isn't an attempt made by the filmmakers to question the characters' actions and that seems to me a grave mistake. As for the philosophical elements of this film? They're adolescent beliefs in breaking free of monotony and ennui; the anti-materialist screed, though justified by our culture, is ultimately shallow. It's angry at consumerism and our love of objects (doesn't this movie love gadgetry and gimmickry though?), but it doesn't really show us any alternative, unless the alternative is violence. And, frankly, I'm not willing to accept that. Or maybe the movie's just saying that the dehumanization present in contemporary society could lead to violence. That's okay, but what's the solution. When you have a film that doesn't really look at quasi- fascist ideas in horror, you need to offer us something. This adolescent nihilism is just, well, silly teenage claptrap. It's like this: when I was 15, I love A Clockwork Orange; I'm older now and find the nihilism of its characters as well as its attempts at formulating ideas about society superficial. That's probably what will happen with the majority of this film's supporters. They'll grow up and realize its an adolescent fantasy made by older men who have yet to mature.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was shocked by how many previous comments referred to an unexpected ""twist"" at the end.Fight Club is simultaneously homo-erotic and homophobic, I think the overwhelming popularity of this film among 18-25 year old (confused) males unfortunately may be explained by the concept repeatedly expressed throughout the film that it is OK to bond with or even hug other men but only if you also hurt each other.I can only recommend purchasing or renting this DVD to those readers who are BOTH somewhat sadistic AND not very bright.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",,"Typically over-directed David Fincher nonsense.Is he actually able to direct a movie that isn't dank, grimy and depressing? There are way to many people out there who hold this claptrap in too high regard. Perhaps they confuse the muddled and self-congratulatory rubbish that is the plot for something deep and meaningful.I found that this film scrapes the bottom of the barrel for reasons to be cynical and faithless. It became increasingly obnoxious and irritating. Edward Norton's character had the most annoying voice and the constant ugly imagery turned me off totally. If this film wanted to poke fun at our society then why did it only show all the ugly parts. Granted, there is a lot of fake, unnatural beauty out there but a helluva lot of this world is still free and nice to look at. Not everywhere is a dull, grey office or a miserable, rainy alleyway.It is also very, very slow. 139 minutes have never seemed so long.A lot of this film could have been cut out and still there would be no MAJOR difference to the story I like the idea that everyone is part of the same gang and by sticking together they can easily bring down modern society. This should have been exploited more. But we only get about 4 or 5 scenes of their antics. But, the whole thing of the gang becoming fascists in their attempt to stop fascism is lost on me. I didn't find it ironic, subtle or meaningful. Sorry.The sub-text about man becoming primal again, and releasing all the rage created from jobs that insult their intelligence and ruin their lives, is lost on me too. It's practically non-existent. I have never been let down so much by a movie that was hyped as being exciting. It was really rather boring.The DVD has a loads of features, annoying and headache inducing. Why did Fox insist on a dozen little featurettes instead of one healthy hour-long documentary? The menus are confusing as is the multi-angle function on the 5-minute ""scene deconstructions"". Who on earth is going to watch all of these 2 or 3 times just to see the different angles and bad camcorder shots of someone working on a computer?

" You too may be a candidate for project chaos

I think the initial meeting of Jack and Tyler explain how opinions of this movie are divided -- Jack says something about single serving friends, and Tyler disinterestedly dismisses his cleverness.  Unfortunately, my friends, being clever for clever's sake is not entertaining and it is not art.
For those of you who loved this movie, perhaps identifying yourselves with the main character is not appropriate.  The point may be that you are just one of the moronic automatons (do hyper-clever acts of terrorism, like a hyper-clever movie), so the joke's on you.  You might also note that the project chaos morons are not recruited for their propensity for violence, but for their desire to think in complex and sensitive ways.  Much like the fans of this movie.I tend to rate a movie on only two criteria:  Was it entertaining? and, Did I care about the characters?  As both of these answers for Fight Club are definitely ""NO"", what am I left with?  A movie with an unoriginal message, revealed in an unintellible way, full of commercials (Starbucks, Busch beer, Pepsi, to name a few), with decent acting.Yes, the pseudo-intellegentsia are all suckers, easy prey to a little pretentiousness they identify with.  In making this obvious fact a little more obvious, the movie was a success.  Maybe the point was to think for yourselves, in which case the only natural reaction should be complete loathing for this film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Violent, lame, Bloody, lame

I'll say this, it is the perfect movie for young troubled, bored, ignored, misunderstood, ever-changing teens who need to escape from the shadows of their predecessors and give themselves that angry identity of screw the world I'm different.Looks like some reviewers lives are so blah that they need to push the levels of taste until they are totally disgusting and morally wrong. What kind of parents do they have is my question.First of all, punching someone in the face that many times can kill them or at least send them to the dentist for free. What makes the kids of today enjoy this type of behavior, fantasy or not? A lot of shirtless men, sure that's a great reason to applaud this movie for some of the messed up women out there who keep picking violent men as boyfriends and then wonder why. I saw no redeeming value in this movie. It took me for a ride and then fooled me at the end, but if anyone rates this in their top 5, 10, whatever then I can guess their age category. Go to school, get a job, have a nice life and adjust your attitudes. I sure don't have the perfect life but obviously better than some of the messed up kids who like this because I don't need to watch people beat the s*** out of each other for entertainment. I'm shocked by the number of positive reviews for this crap. Get therapy, please.I give this movie a 3 of 10, and that's generous. It sure is not rated an 8 like the score in front reveals. Now I know overall statistics mean absolutely nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" This movie is garbage
",,"This movie is not that good. After seeing this movie, I wouldn't ever pay cash money to see this again. I will never rent this movie again. I probably wouldn't watch it on TV if it came on. It's really that bad. $3.50 is not worth watching this movie. Do not rent it. It is awful. My reason for this opinion is the fact that it doesn't make sense in most scenes. The part where he's burning his hand is fairly impossible. The ending is really bad. I mean, it's so bad that I almost threw a flower pot at the TV screen. And don't be misled by the title. It's not really about a fight club, it's about something more absurd. Edward Norton did the best job he could with this lousy script, and even Brad Pitt did a mediocre job. The surprise ending is nothing like The Sixth Sense. I'd rather see that movie twenty more times rather than see 5 minutes from Fight Club. I've read some comments about this movie, and I don't know what you guys are talking about. It's not that good. Some plot twists does not make for good movie making. This movie is on the level of Judge Dredd. No wait, Judge Dredd isn't this bad.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" All Pretension, No Punch
",,"Arguably, nihilism in films is best personified by David Fincher, who in only three films has already set his stamp on filmmaking.  Of course, we didn't realize this until his second film which is the now classic ""Seven."" But in retrospect ""Seven "" was as bleak and despairing as anything done in mainstream cinema, and it was a Hollywood thriller no less.  Then came ""The Game,"" a disappointment, but with the intriguing premise of a bottled-up and unemotional man who in the course of his nightmarish ""game"" learns to live again.  ""Carpe Diem"" a la Kafka.  This same premise is put into a societal point of view with ""Fight Club.""This is also Fincher's first literary adaptation.  ""Fight Club"" comes to us via the novel written by Chuck Palahniuk.  The film relates the story of a successful, yet depressed young man (Edward Norton) who has become an insomniac.  He has a swanky apartment, catalog-ordered furniture, and a respectable position in a firm, yet he feels like he is missing out on life. He can't feel emotion anymore.  On a whim, he visits a cancer-crisis group and bonds with Bob, played by Meatloaf, who now has breasts because of a rare cancer (insert laughter here).  This bonding and emotional intimacy leads to catharsis and release, especially when he weeps between Bob's ample breasts.  Not surprisingly, Norton sleeps well.Things are moving along great.  Never mind that he's using these victims as emotional pumps, the point is he feels again.  Then comes an uninvited femme fatale played with unabashed scuzziness by Helena Bonham-Carter...and she used to do Merchant-Ivory?Because of this fellow emotional sponge, Norton must look elsewhere. Enter Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): Soap salesman and excrement chef who urinates in his customers' soups.  These two bond by beating the crap out of each other. ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can, "" Durden says.  Norton obliges by punching his ear.Soon though, a friendship is formed and Norton loses his pad thanks to a freak fire.  Norton stays with Durden and the two continue to pummel each other.  Naturallly, other men gravitate.  Finally, a club is established in which white-collar, civil, and cultured gentlemen become primal gladiators in a self-imposed ring.  The object:  Fight so one can feel masculine again.As with anything purely physical (and make no mistake that is exactly what it is) Durden decides to up the ante a tad and create a full-fledged urban terrorism group.  Nihilism by way of Fascism.  You see, ""Fight Club"" is about destroying the modern spineless society so that men can go back to what they truly are, hunters.  Only problem is where does one draw the line?First off, the positive.  ""Fight Club"" is technically brilliant. Audacious and stylistic, Fincher plays with our tale being told by Norton's narrator. So Norton talks directly to the camera, stops the film for a bit of background information on characters, and lets other characters comment as well.  Durden explaining his story is hilarious and twisted.  The camera swoops into Norton's brain at one point and we take a stroll around his pad even seeing the price for each item.  The energy is infectious and the acting by all the principles, especially Norton and Carter are top-notch.Is there any negative?  Yep.I felt dirty watching this film.  I felt the same way when watching ""Natural Born Killers.""  Yes, it was satire as I'm sure ""Fight Club"" is as well. But the satire seems to be unfocused.  What  exactly is the point of seeing guys pummel each other and pick fights with innocents?  Does Fincher support the premise of violence to save souls or are they all doomed anyway?  And I must be getting soft, but there were scenes that grossed me out, specifically the human fat scene (Don't ask).  Satire does not work by exaggeration alone; there needs to be purpose.  That's something ""A Clockwork Orange"" had. Yes, it was violent and disturbing.  But there was a point to the film. Science cannot curb man's morality nor should it.  What does ""Fight Club"" say, let's all revert back to cavemen?  Sorry, not interested.The ending is just plain dumb.  I will not reveal anything, but be prepared for pretension deluxe.A friend of mine compared this film to ""American Beauty"" saying that both films dealt with changing one's humdrum existence into a life full of meaning.  But ""Beauty"" had something that ""Fight Club"" lacked.  Humanity. At the end of ""Beauty"", Lester Burnham thinks he has found purpose in enjoying life again, but he realizes that his life had purpose all along because of his family.  Burnham comes full circle.  We never get that kind of revelation in ""Club.""  The selfishness in achieving nirvana through nihilism remains and a hollowness remains at the film's center.Fincher's movies are disturbing, that's just a given.  But their saving grace, especially in the case of ""Seven,"" is their imagination and story. ""Fight Club"" has its imagination as well.  However, because of its trite story, I can't say it was a saving anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Bring back NC-17
",,"Admittedly, I would have never gone to see Fight Club if it hadn't been part of a class I'm taking at USC, but this film makes you wonder what it takes for the MPAA not to give a film an R rating. It's so gratuitously violent and downright gross (even in non-violent scenes) that Pulp Fiction looks tame by comparison.Seriously, it's hyped as a violent film about non-violence, but isn't that akin to saying a film with gratuitous sex can be about abstinence. Sure, I guess it could, but you'd be hard pressed to find an example, just as I find it hard to believe that anyone honestly thinks this film is more than a glorified Faces Of Death with big name actors.I don't know what else to say, but keep your kids (and yourself) away from this film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Shocking IMDb Ranking
",spoiler,"Just the fact that most men that drool over this film tend to react angrily when I convey my negative opinions of ""Fight Club"", proves that this film not only fails to deliver any new and important ideas, but also that it encourages the mainstream male marketing plan: Be angry, be violent, be masculine, be straight, be selfish, and most of all be stupid. The film employs a juvenile sense of humor/ comedy approach that's immature and sickening. The ending is a total idiotic rip off that makes the watching of this garbage a waste of time. The deep message here is that young white males victimized by society can fight commercialism by beating the s**t out of each other. Wow man, that's really deep. Cue ""You just don't get the movie man"". Yeah, I just don't get the movie. What a joke.The whole premise behind ""Fight Club"" is tiresome and trite, oh the poor straight healthy young male! And how he's been victimized? ""Fight Club"" is a movie produced by the sickening Hollywood greed machine; and the funny thing is that the makers of this film are essentially preaching about commercialization and greed. That really makes sense. I wonder how many fat cat pots were filled by this production? Here's a tip to all young men that really want to fight greed, commercialism,and corporations........ GO TO COLLEGE, and major in something you have an interest in. I was shocked when I learned that men all over the U.S. started their own REAL fight clubs because of this movie. Brad Pitt beating me over the head with clichéd anti-commercialism ideals for over two hours is not my idea of an 8.7 rating. Pitt and Norton are lukewarm at best and overrated by most. The there's always the argument that, It's about a schizophrenic man"". Like that statement somehow justifies the idiocy of ""Fight Club"". But hey, I just don't get.

It was thoroughly violent, but violence is not what offended me most.  The violence for violence' sake offended me.  The pointlessness of the movie offended me. The ""God hates you"" dialogue offended me.  I was glad to see that 2 other people had already agreed with me and given the movie a rating of 1.  Do not waste your money on this movie.

" Stylish pitch-black comedy keeps winning die-hard sham-rager fans but is no answer to what ails them.
",spoiler,"""How many nihilists does it take to change a light-bulb?"" ""-Half."" (Gettit?) Fight Club(1999) is a highly stylised hybrid--a pitch-black comedy that's hard to like unless you're male, and (possibly) clawing your way BACK from the edge of abyss.It opens with a CGI-fly-past of firing neurons under the credits, suggesting what follows is caused by misfires in the protagonist's brain. But you miss that at first for all the uncharted territory.James Uhls' impressive screen adaptation continues Chuck Palahniuk's novel attempts to revolutionize men's views of their place in first-world-societies where caveman sensibilities are literally no longer required.Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt) characterizes our generation in one of his early Fight Club welcome speeches: ""We're the middle children of history--we have no Great War"", meaning that men raised without brutality still crave it--and why so many of them eagerly join up. But Club(1999) delineates its message for just one gender, never pretending to speak for women: the narrator observes that before becoming yuppies, ""we used to read pornography"": young girls were never so inclined.Nevertheless, it's frightening how many people the film appeals to. Fans over-enthuse, saying ""this is the BEST movie EVER"". Professional critics aren't so impressed. One courageous video & DVD guide claims that ""...this appalling, grotesque, and interminable endurance-test is fairytale fiction for serial killers, imbeciles who succumb to road rage, and frustrated white guys--all the morons who seek excuses for their increasingly bad behavior and hair-trigger tempers"".This temper-thing in the psych business is called ""sham-rage"" (or ""decortication"" after the severing of the neocortex in 1948 experiments on pussycats)- www.emotion.caltech.edu/courses/ss140/April17-1.pdf. The ""misfire"" in Jack's brain depicts such a neurochemical break.But maybe Jack(Ed Norton) and Tyler(Brad Pitt) have a point. To me, the movie is saying that ""frustrated"" guys are really no good for women, because, frankly, they just don't want what women have to give. Such men might now want to bond only with each other, to satisfy ancient caveman instincts, which civilisation--and women--are trying to breed out of them.That's why Jack & Tyler's fight clubs quickly evolve into organised anarchism, and eventually nihilism--the wish to destroy all moral and social edifices: males are getting back to their roots.Having ""said"" that, Fight Club(1999) tries to throw a lifeline to the seriously disaffected; but that lifeline falls on deaf ears. (*****Spoiler: The ending depicts Jack's retaking control from his ""teacher"" by redefining his personal limits regarding violence. The protagonist successfully battles his delusion to finally regain himself. He has learnt better.*****) The ""nasty"" existentialism of anarchism/nihilism still tends to appeal to young men, despite its dead-end logic. A recent email asked me whether I thought this ""philosophy of unreason"" was a mental deficiency or a choice. I call it a deficiency, as Fight Club(1999) does; the question is only how permanent that is. It can be considered foolishness--which is unlearnable; or sociopathy--which isn't.It's nice to know even its proponents (like my email friend) think this ""unreason"" is subject to cognitive override--choice--but why would anyone choose it unless their unreason validates some physiological syndrome? Anti-establishment anarchism was last big in the 19thC, having FIRST given rise to Machiavelli. During both periods it was a might-makes-right power struggle against ruling elites. We now think of these periods as callous, brutal and primitive, certainly not part of civilisation today. We expect ""civilians"" to abide by higher universal standards of humanism. Clearly, blowing up buildings and bashing each other half to death is antithetical to that social contract.However, I do like the film's position that male bonding, with/without a sexual component, might be just what they need. During a bonding session with Tyler, as they consider Jack's heterosexual relationship, Jack admits, ""I can't get married; I'm a 30yr-old boy""--to which Tyler adds, ""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is the answer we need"".This is gender politics; and Norton goes to great lengths on the commentary track to explain Jack's mistreatment of Marla (Helena Bonham-Carter) as symptomatic of Jack's social and mental incompetence. Misogyny itself, the male hatred of women, may be physiologically inspired in such boy-men struggling to behave civilly. Ancient reptilian brain-structures produce the primal urge to violence (ie just to feel alive), so fight-club violence might not be caused by ""social malaise"" at all.I suspect this is the movie's--and novel's--most unpalatable basis, making Fight Club(1999) seem ""irresponsible"" to its critics.We usually call reptilian brain-structures ""primitive"" because except in lizards (hence ""lizard-logic""), they're buried deep in the brain, overlain by ""higher"", mammalian brain-structures. Lifelong learning encapsulated in the neocortex of, say, pussycats, inhibits/overrides this reptilian dominance, but in some (""decorticated"" pussycats or people) the process may be faulty, or just take too long. However if graduating beyond such lizard-logic (anarchist idiocy) takes ""fight-clubbers"" most of their lifetime, then so be it--until then, such men are welcome to have s*x with each other.Fight Club(1999)'s main problem is that it stirs up the powerful philosophical issue of anarchism/nihilism, but leaves it unresolved, notably with its ending. The entire closing scene, including the bombing, is visually nebulous. Did all that happen, or was it just Jack's imagination? Comprehension is deliberately muddied by Jack's speedy recovery(!) from a fatal gunshot wound. Like many, I laughed at its absurdity.Yet the film's showmanship still wins new converts. It seems to set the benchmark for neocinema by demanding freeze-frame plus several viewings to build its enjoyment. Like Sixth Sense(1999), Club(1999) employs perception-shift for the lead character, but here it's integrated linearly to unfold the story. (In Sense(1999) the perception-shift is recursive- cf. www.cse.nd.edu/courses/cse233/www/lectures/ri.pdf OR http://mitpress.mit.edu/sicp/full-text/sicp/book/node15.html.)Club(1999) further winks at us with single-frame interjections of--supposedly--Tyler's full frontals throughout Jack's narration. They serve both as alerts to Jack's insanity, and as visual ""easter-eggs"".Other clever concepts are borrowed from social philosophy, eg the politics of rich women's fat-paranoia (soapmaking): true recycling, trés Soylent Green(1973).---END_OF_PART1---",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Worst ending ever..
",,"Two great movies, in my opinion, are `The Game' and `Seven'-- Both directed by David Fincher.  So, obviously, I went into `Fight Club' wanting to love it.  And I did.  Well, the first half, anyway.  From there on, it went straight downhill into just another Hollywood-produced uncreative clone-movie.  I could go in and pin-point the exact frame where the film turns from an intriguing, smart drama into an unimaginitive hybrid of two of the worst movies that I've seen:  `The Matrix' and `Dark City'.All three of these movies seem to have a common  `new-age' theme.  They all convey the message, `The individual can do anything, and as long as they don 't seek aid  from an outside source, their power is limitless.'  Maybe these Anti-Establishment / Anti-Religion ideals are just a faze in modern media, but it could also be the direction the industry will be heading in the future.As for `Fight Club' on its own, Brad Pitt and Edward Norton play their parts well, and the movie does have some redeeming elements, but overall I can't recommend it.  But, don't let that dissuade you from seeing the movie-- I'd never say, `Don't see this movie'.  You should always see the movie to have an opinion of your own.  Just watch this one with your eyes open.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It currently ranks at #33 on the IMDb top 250, so you can understand why my mind was blown when an IMDb user actually called this movie ""underappreciated"".  The truth is that it's OVERappreciated.  ""Fight Club"" is not the groundbreaking, sensational work of genius many fans call it.  There aren't any stagerringly original ideas, apart from Fight Club itself.  The film is pointlessly overlong, with a ridiculous ending that was not at all needed.  So I see no reason why anyone would ever think that this movie was underappreciated.

" Another Fincher fairy tale
",,"I've heard many people say (and seen many reviews written) that Fight Club is a classic.  Mind blowing.  Completely fresh.  Sorry, but I just don't see it.  I'll start with the positives.  Ed Norton and Brad Pitt were excellent. Pitt perfectly captures the super-cool, no attachments, nothing-to-lose attitude that so many young guys have before they get old and come back down to earth.  Norton is also perfect as the uptight, frustrated yuppie bored with life's vapidity.  Even Helena Bonham Carter, who I normally don't much care for, was okay in the generic girlfriend role.Now on to the negatives.  The story is just utterly preposterous.  Maybe even more so than Fincher's last absurd movie, The Game.  The movie really lost all believability when Fight Club turns into the cult, Project Mayhem. Although it has a nice twist ending with the Pitt/Norton dynamic, I couldn't buy that they could get legions of grown men to become such mindless, fanatical followers.  Pitt's charismatic, but not nearly charismatic to cover up the fact his philosophy is tired and his idea of subversion is nothing except vandalism and petty theft.  The movie has pretensions of making a statement about consumerism but I thought it made them pretty succintly with the intro where Norton describes his perfect condo, filled with things he really didn't need.  Everything else is overkill.  And the final big plan to blow up (I won't say what in case you haven't seen the movie yet) in order to level the world playing field is...well....pointless. Just like The Game, Fincher takes some good parts and sews them into a tapestry of mediocrity.  I give it 6 out of 10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" ""First you have to give up, first you have to know  not fear  know that someday you're gonna die.""
",spoiler,"Fight club, it's just a movie everyone should watch. I really liked the message in the movie, the performance of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and you've just got to love 'em quotes. The one that got me thinking was; ""It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything."" The movie is a bit harsh, but with an quite understanding and strong message. I saw this movie a couple of years ago and before that i though, yeah, it's a raw movie with men fighting. BUT, this movie was so much more than that! This truly is a masterpiece and i think it's the best movie made so far. I've studied philosophy and though this had the same message as the absurdism gives you. That the meaning of life doesn't exists. And of course the messages from the quotes, we're people who are addicted to material goods. And after we loose everything, we are free to do anything. We are no longer hooked on these goods and are free to do anything. The character that Edward Norton plays, changes a lot during the movie. He starts as an man who works in an dead end office job, is hooked on material goods (from IKEA) and suffers from insomnia. After he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) his life changes. But after i saw the ending, i couldn't believe what i've just witnessed. A perfect movie, with an great ending. The ending changes the whole movie, just in minutes.Just like this quote; ""The first soap was made from the ashes of heroes, like the first monkey shot into space. Without pain, without sacrifice, we would have nothing."" So, right and in an way that people really take it serious and starts thinking. So to all them ""treehuggers"", this is an loud message. It's just one of the movies that you think after you've seen it, yeah it was nice. And the next morning you think, that was really nice. It just gets better from day to day. This movie actually got me interested in philosophy.10/10 of course.

" It makes no sense. AGGGGGHHHHH!!!!!!!
",spoiler,"1ST PARAGRAPH CONTAINS NO SPOILERS. This has all the hallmarks of a great movie, a very fluid sense of direction, cool cinematography, cool one-liners, and a fresh and innovative storyline. Slowly you start to notice gaps in the plot, which you accept because with a movie like this you know to expect a twist later on. As the movie progresses into anarchy you become increasingly more desperate to work out what the 'twist' is as the plot becomes more elaborate and nagging discrepancies are brought to the fore. You'll have a long wait cos its only revealed at the end of the movie and when you get there its like ""WWHHHHAAAAAATT???"", (pause for a few seconds as it filters in), ""hmmmmm, maybe i wasn't paying proper attention, no problem i'll have another watch in a few days"". With the 'knowledge' now sitting in your cerebral cortex you follow the story fully armed and only now you fully appreciate how big a cock-up the writer made.SPOILERS FROM HEREONFor those that have seen this movie, if you do not agree, i think i only need to point to one scene. If you saw a guy in your local park or even a car park (as in the infamous scene where fight club is officially born) having a psychotic episode and trying really hard to hurt himself in an at first comical, but as the moments pass more disturbing, fashion (interlude: Have you realised how hard it is to use physical attacks on yourself?

So you see him and its about midnight; what do you do?1. If your a good Samaritan you call an ambulance (and the mental health people). 2. If your a normal person you try your best to avoid him by keeping a distance of at least 20 yards at all times. 3. If your unhinged you help him accomplish his ever so difficult task of hurting himself.What you do not do is say, ""Hey dude, you're a great fighter. Wanna start up a fight club where we can all share our passion for self-mutilation on a weekly basis. You do? Great, we might also wanna erase the national credit history database without letting people know how we actually accomplished it by taking down a skyscraper."" I know not to take this movie seriously but the fact that the writer having come up with a good plot twist, using that as the be all and end all of the movie, couldn't be bothered to finish the job and tie up all the loose ends that actually make up the story really drives me up the wall.

" Why can't they make more movie likes this?
",,"The writing is brilliant, the voice of the ""Narrator"" is honest and the acting is just right. Norton and Pitt make such a great team, I wonder when they are going to make their next movie. And the comments about consumerist society ring very true, even though we probably won't admit it to ourselves because it's a shell of comfort that even we ourselves are not ready to shed.The plot isn't too heavy, and the reveal at the end progresses perfectly. I'd take a twist ending like this one and ""The Usual Suspects"" over the twist in the next M. Night Shyamalan thriller any day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Style over substance.
",,"This is a good example of what happens when people who've been reading comic books and watched better movies all their lives get to make their own. I may be wrong in my assessment of David Fincher's adolescent pursuits but the point I'm trying to get at is that there is very little articulate and nothing even remotely original about ""Fight Club"". Both conceptually and visually it seems to be one big incoherent, messy smorgasbord of Orwell, early '90s MTV, Kubrick, punk, etc, etc.When all the unnatural 'coolness' (jump cuts, hipper than thou narrative, flickering images) is stripped away, what you're left with is a bunch of half-ass, unfinished ideas about capitalist social order, human nature, battle of the sexes, meaning of life in a modern world, male frustration etc. And in a movie that chooses to treat its characters solely as metaphors rather than to tell a story, it's especially important that at least a shred of uniqueness in point of view is present. As it is, ""Fight Club"" doesn't even seem to have a coherent point of view about the subjects it touches on, other than maybe ""go let it out"" or ""if it feels good do it"". Yeah man, rock'n'roll!!!It begins with nameless character (played by Edward Norton), known in credits only as Narrator, spiritually and physically beaten 30-year-old professional fighting insomnia and seeking a way to reconnect with the world, although I doubt he was ever properly connected to begin with. He is engaged in a losing battle with life he chose (although judging by his misery you'd think somebody else chose it for him). Battle that's fought on modern day yuppie frontlines - corporate offices, airports, his expensive IKEA decorated condo, airline first class, business trips etc., and is in desperate need of something. Watching from aside one would think that something is emotional comfort, meaning, love or a thing along those lines. Whatever it is, he seems to have found it, albeit briefly, in various disease support groups that he now starts to frequent pretending to have different ailment or disease for every day of the week. Listening to people, in some cases dying, open up about their problems gives him a visceral sense of freedom. Suddenly he can sleep and enjoy life again. ""I let go. I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom"", he reasons. Until..Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) strolls into his life and messes all of that up. She, you see, is also a 'tourist' - someone pretending to be sick - and the knowledge that another person like him is present at these meetings bothers our Narrator to the point that his insomnia returns. He confronts her about that and to avoid running into each other they divvy up the meetings in a lame exchange that tries to be funny but only ends up resembling something Rachel and Chandler might say to each other on 'Friends'.The story then shifts to Narrator's relationship with a strange but fascinating fellow named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) with whom he hits it off on a plane during a business trip. Their bond intensifies after Narrator returns home and finds his condo blown to smithereens as a result of an electrical malfunction. Having no family or friends to turn to in a time of need, he calls Tyler and soon moves in with him in a boarded-up apocalyptic house. On Tyler's insistence they found a weekly fight club that starts up as a jealously guarded secret clique where a few young males can nurse their anxieties and frustrations by beating each other to a bloody pulp!? Bingo! This is what Narrator has been looking for all his adult life.Soon, though, the whole thing grows in popularity, Marla makes a return, Tyler's behaviour takes stranger turns and problems start to pile up. It is during this part that the movie makes its various cheesy points. Case-in-point the scene in which Tyler ambushes a convenience store, takes the clerk outside, points a gun to his head and under a threat of death forces him to go back to college. Wow, symbolism overload!!! And how deep, too!The rest of the movie seldom gets better than that including a sketchy ending that features a crucial fist/gun fight, a bomb with obligatory display counting down and other such things no true Hollywood action movie can do without.In the end I kinda felt like I watched an extended commercial/music video that made me think of Spike Jonze. Then I learned David Fincher also directed music videos. And although this was more viewable than Jonze's dismal ""Being John Malkovich"" it's still a pretty mediocre offering. Those who refer to ""Fight Club"" as a masterpiece probably also consider Eminem and Fred Durst to be the modern generation's sharpest voices.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I'm not really convinced about Pitt's acting. I don't know if the director's intentions with Pitt was to show his famous muscles. This movie was not about to be the sequel of Troy! While Norton captivated the attention running with ridiculous underwear and a beaten face, Pitt appeared to be a god with a perfect body and with a not very beaten face, given the circumstances. It seems that the leading role was assigned to Pitt, but Norton is the one who deserves it.

" Irresponsible filmmaking
",,"The fact that so many people liked this movie disturbed me. Is violence really the only way to escape societal constraints? Using consumerism as a straw man, the movie says that all males are, inherently, prone to violence and that society is denying them the right to exercise this innateness. After glorifying violence for 2 1/2 hours, the filmmakers decide to say ""but really violence is not quite as good as we might have led you to believe."" Most males will come out of this movie saying "" cool man. we should start a fight club so that we can be real men"" and that is irresponsible filmmaking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Unintelligent and uninteresting,
",,"This is easily one of the worst films ever created.  The beginning, I must admit, is different and quite intriguing.  I mean, who would have ever thought of a guy who is addicted to 12 step programs.  But the minute that Brad Pitt's face hits the screen we are soon forced into mind numbing, senseless, violent trash.  I think that violence must be used for a purpose, such in Reserviour Dogs or Raging Bull.  In these movies we see violence as a tool to push the desperation and hopelessness of the main characters.  In Fight Club we see violence as a tool to drive along a bunch of nonsense, possibly the only reason I could see for all of the fights was for the male characters to bring out their pent up Freudian fantasies for violence.  If you want an immature movie where men beat the c**p out of each other for no reason then go ahead, bon appetite.  But if you want a movie that has any intelligence or sense of reality then please do your self a favor and spend your money elsewhere.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Save your money
",,"This is possibly the worst movie I've ever seen.  I hear it's supposed to appeal to my generation (I'm 22), since we've been brought up on a diet of senseless violence and MTV.  Now, I don't automatically think there's anything wrong with violence in movies, as long as there's some justification for it, and I like watching MTV (when they actually play videos), but I found this film terrible.  Up until about the middle of the movie, there might have been a chance for this movie to find itself and deliver some real social commentary (which is the only possible reason other then pure, sick voyeurism that might justify the horrific violence). Unfortunately, ""Fight Club"" then took a turn for the worse, not for the better, and delivered an even more bizarre, more violent ending.  Save your money: something--ANYTHING--on TV or at the $1.75 movie theater is better than this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

For the first time in my life, however, I was motivated actually to get up and to leave the theatre in the middle of the film. Yes, the movie has a message beyond ""fighting is good"", but it is just so in-your-face that I couldn't take any more after the first hour. It did not help that I didn't care what happened to any of the characters, even though I don't have a problem with Brad, Edward, or Helena generally. Anyone who saw this movie and came away wondering exactly what the director was trying to say must have been asleep. I don't think that a film has to be completely offensive to make a point. Of course this is only my opinion! I know there is supposedly a plot twist at the end, and whatever it was, it just could not have been worth another hour and a half of this film to get to it.By the way I have seen other ""offensive"" movies and enjoyed them, Natural Born Killers being one of them, so I am not just being a weenie about the whole thing. I liked Se7en, and I completely loved The Game, but this one just is not up to their standards.

" Fincher is out of control.
",,"David Fincher. I think his career might have been a tragedy if he actually made some good early films. He had alot of promise but is now sucked into the world of the fanboy where he reins as their god. This world is made up of angry youth, most of whom like computers, violence, and sex, though they are underexperienced with it in actuality. No more evident is this than in Fight Club. If you need proof read one of the hundred claims that this is the pinnacle of filmmaking. Since these people are cultish and do not listen to reasonable argument, I will waste so much time as to actually give the entire argument against this film, as I see it.I think Fincher actually had a message, however he has no control over his own abilities. I think using logic his film is about the value of the individual. This is extremely ironic, since his film has inspired homogenous worshipers. The first third of the film is a damnation of the working environment. The last third is, I'm guessing, supposed to be a damnation of the second third. The second third is the escape from the working class through a violent cult. This is only the most logical explanation, for me anyway. I think many people fail to see the last third as a damnation of the second third because Fincher creates it as such a paradise juxtaposed next to the working week. Fincher is too seduced by his own tricks that he can't convey his own message, and we as viewers are left with the remnants of a very negative film with no purpose for it's violent, destructive nature and no redeeming values at all. So maybe it isn't what the film is about. Most of it's fans would gladly join up with the cult and follow Tyler into chaos. The message of the film is really quite hollow. And the way it is done is just silly. 3/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" An unpleasant masterpiece
",,"A perfect adaptation from the book of Chuck Palahniuk by one of the best directors David Fincher.You feel uncomfortable every time you watch this film but you can´t stop watching it. Every time you find details that you missed the first time. Definetly advanced about how society its blinded with stupid consumism and nowadays with social newtworks and all the same ""things"" we still don´t need. Its a movie about real life, about decisions, about yourself, about the dreams you left behind, a wake up call. But as Palahniuk says, its also a love story.
The common error about this movie was that people thought it was a stupid fight movie, when its really a mind blower, philosophical movie.Great performances by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, definetly a cult film that was and i think its still underrated.In Tyler we trust",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" A helpful understanding
",spoiler,"A lot of people have this movie all wrong. Especially the ones giving it the negative reviews. This movie isn't about following in Tyler Durdens footsteps which a lot of of people on both sides think.Now I only allow myself to have one 10 star movie and one 10 star tv-show(band of brothers). This movie is my number 10. This movie starts out showing us how much of our society is brainwashed and dull. How nothing we do is fulfilling. It's takes you through the narrators life of buying useless junk that is supposed to make him feel better.Then he meets Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden in the begging is the hero of the movie. He shows people how dull and asleep they are. He forces them to follow dreams that society has made them push far down. The narrator made him because as said in the movie ""it's not till you lose everything that you are free to do anything."" And the narrator had lost everything. He was a complete loser and made a strong personality for himself that took over. Tyler was the one that woke him and many others up to the toxic society they lived in.Unless you've seen the movie many Times the next part might not be as clear but Tyler then becomes the villain/antagonist. He used his influence to cause terror. The writers try to make you understand in the end that Tyler is no longer the one to look to. It's trying to show you that we as a society follow the strongest personality and don't do things for ourselves.The movie starts out showing us that we are dull society and uses Tyler to portray a way out. To get out of consumerism and wake up follow our dreams. It then turns the movie around after the narrator wakes up. The movie then try's to tell us that we as a society need to stop following the strongest personality. It again uses Tyler Durden to portray this but in a negative light as the narrator is now the protagonist.As for the reviewers giving negative reviews for the plot holes and calling themselves ""cultured"" I've seen 80% of the top 250 and almost all of the classics out of that. This is one of the best movies I've seen at covering all of it's holes. The narrator is an insomniac and therefore cannot sleep giving Tyler plenty of time to do his work. Just because the movie isn't 25 hours long and shows you how Tyler does everything doesn't mean that you cannot use your brain to put two and two together. You have to watch this move many times to even have an understanding of it and watching it once and deciding it's not to your level is childish and shows how little you know.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Over-rated
",,"This is a set-piece for two of the finest contemporary actors in Norton and Pitt. Their performances as the narrator and Tyler Durden are superb, as any other review herein will show you. The cinematography is good, directing fine and the script at times good.However, I was disappointed with the movie as a whole. The actors are clearly leading up to a climax which was predictable, had you seen more movies of this thriller/drama/action genre. If you want a brilliant ending, watch Primal Fear (Norton excellent), if you want a suave and well written script watch Chasing Amy and for an action movie with brutal fight scenes Raging Bull. For a complete movie that will move you and not leave you feeling empty and short-changed then the superb American History X or Marathon Man may be more your scene.The plot and so on is probably heavily disclosed in the reviews contained before and after this, beware reading these may lead you to anticipate the easily predictable ""TWIST"".Disagree with me after seeing all of the suggested movies, I dare you, here is the list again: American History X, Chasing Amy, Marathon Man, Primal Fear and Raging Bull.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" SLEEPER.
",,"I am back for my second review of Fight Club. Why, you ask? Because I  was told I had an ""inadequate"" amount of evidence to prove my point! So  here I go.  Fight Club is a very strange, erratic movie that, quite honestly,  nearly put me to sleep within the first ten minutes. It seemed that the  whole movie revolved around an insomniac! And that's true--this movie  is about nothing but a guy who can't sleep. For over half of it seems  to be the very first movie that has no plot, no decent characters (what  kind of main character is known only as ""The Narrator""?), and a crummy  soundtrack. I was SO disappointed.  ""Plot Outline: A man disillusioned by what his life has become  encounters an exciting stranger who introduces him to a new way of  life.""  Well, yeah, that's all fine and dandy, but this new way of life doesn't  come in until WAY later. And once Fight Club is finally introduced, it  is hardly shown. Then it turns into a macho group of terrorists... I'm  sorry, but how utterly boring! From the commercials and video cover, I  was expecting there to be a plot that revolved around the Fight Club.  Instead, I was slapped in the face with this stupid terrorist group  that doesn't serve a purpose.  I now have to go to Helena Bonham Carter. Hey, lady, you did excellent  in Planet of the Apes! But in this movie she plays as a rival  counseling group member (speaking of which, what purpose do these  groups serve for the movie?  NOTHING!  The final conflict, in which The Narrator (boy, that name is just so  cool) is fighting ""himself"", is utterly pathetic. How boring. And then  the buildings topple... and that's the end. Ho! Wait! I see a naked man  from the waist down at the ending! Maybe this is the second reason  people liked this stupid, boring movie so much. It shows both female  AND male anatomy.  How stupid! Repulsive! I DESPISED this movie. Now you know why. If, in  fact, you STILL don't understand, listen closely:  1. Boring 2. No plot (adds to number 1) 3. Shallow characters 4. Actual  film has hardly anything to do with its title 5. Constant  swearing/nudity that sickened me 6. Music was cruddy  Basically, this film reeked of anything but stupidity. I was so sick of  it before the first half hour was up.  I will never watch it again.

" Jon Monsarrat review: too arty, too violent, mindless & awful
",,"I won't spoil the plot for you if I say that ""Fight Club"" is about guys who like to fight each other, no holds barred. I'm an action movie buff, so I thought it might be fun and cartoony. I like Jackie Chan, Arnold Schwarzenegger, etc. But I hated this film.The violence is very real and awful. There is a lot of pretentious art crap (such as Brad Pitt appearing for brief flickers of time), and the film is similar to war films whose sole purpose is to show you the horror of war. I've got enough problems without psychological trauma, thank you very much.Plus, the characters are incredibly unbelievable. When you fight someone in real life and do real damage, the human reaction is you go to a hospital, you think ow ow ow ow, and you think I'd better stop fighting. No. These guys eat it up and turn it into a hobby. That's psychopathic.Who should see this film:-- film school types: go crazy, have a blast watching the blood-- action movie types with a strong lack of empathy for suffering. And stay away from my daughter.Sorry, but at least I've stated some intelligent reasons for giving Fight Club a worst-of-the-worst 1 out of 10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Lame
",spoiler,"I can't believe this shaggy dog of a movie now rests at number #30 on the best movies ever list. Fight Club is so lame that it's not funny.*spoilers*So, the Brad Pitt character doesn't exist. He's just what the Ed Norton character wishes he could be. This means that all them scenes with Norton fighting with Brad Pitt was actually just Norton physically fighting with himself! Huh? And they want us to believe that the fight club began with other guys interested in joining one guy who keeps fighting with himself? If I see a guy fighting with himself, I won't try to join in but run. Run away as fast as possible.The whole basis of the ""story"" is so lame, it's not to be believed. It's equivalent to an entire episode of Star Trek taking place in the freaking Holodeck. It's like an entire season of Dallas brushed off because Bobby's death was all but a dream.There's no emotional pay-off to all the insanity going on screen. And because of this, the whole idea of Norton's dementia, something that could have been emotionally overwhelming, simply becomes tired and cheap. David Fincher's direction is to blame here. He uses layers and layers of cinematic techniques which belie the whole resolution of the story: Norton talking directly to the screen; Norton's annoying voice-over (oh, please stop talking!); the movie begins when the story ends and by the end of the film we are then guided back by Norton to where exactly the ""real"" story began (which is bunk because at the end, Norton is acutely aware that the Tyler is a figment of his imagination and yet throughout the film his voice-over gives no hint that Tyler is not real); tons o' red herrings in the storyline that are there just to hide the fact that there's no story here, folks. Loads of techniques usually reserved for more whimsical stuff simply don't belong here. And add to this pot-pourri of directors' tricks a gazillion gratuitously flashy scenes just to distract the (MTV) jaded audience long enough here and there for nanoseconds and you basically have what Fight Club is: lame.Fincher's direction is set on overkill. Fight Club is an extremely overdirected movie. For instance, the opening credits. Now why the use of crappy, flashy CGI effects when a standard opening credit would have been sufficient? No reason but to be (very) showy. Fight Club is overdirected, overwritten, overacted, overly clever for its own good, over EVERYTHING, with a lame, nonexistent story at its center!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was pleasantly surprised that this ended up not being the case.  Apparently he has decided to devolve into that predicted state.This film was not a bad idea and the acting was good (with what was provided) so that leaves us with the presentation being the problem.  The focus of the film was very disjointed.  The dialogue was vague and an seemed to try too hard and coming up with the next big quotable.  And the cinematography was .... well ... Fincher - if you're going to roll a film that is so colorless, just make it black and white!I'd love to see them remake this movie with some different direction - there was some real potential in it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" ""Full of sound and fury...

The movie's first half hour does a great job exploring the hollow nature of modern life, such as the scene where Norton's living room is gradually ""furnished"" with items right out of the catalog, complete with their price and description.  Yes, we've seen it before, but Norton's performance in the first part of the film brings the script to life.  And then along comes a solid dose of Hollywood machismo, wrapped up in a buff, Brad Pitt package.  Now here's what I have a real problem with: all these young men find salvation through beating each other senseless. Okay, athletic competition has long served that purpose; remember varsity football? But it only goes so far...and the movie's only half over.  What does that leave: a paramilitary organization (!?!?), a weak ending, and an attempt to turn bonding-through-brutality into a way of life. No doubt, it sells tickets, but it defeats its own purpose. Norton's character has been destroyed by modern life; it's a shame that all that's left him is destroying others' bodies. And apartments.

" Hello??? Doesn't anyone care about coherency anymore???
",spoiler,"First, the good stuff.  The acting was superb.  Edward Norton was very strong (though I expected more, somehow) and Brad Pitt was a phenomenon. I'm glad Sean Penn pulled out of this role, though I'm sure he would have nailed it as well (and in a very different way, I'll bet).  The direction was also interesting, though it seemed like the director was enjoying himself to much.  So much of it seemed like the ""wouldn't it be cool if..."" style of direction.Now, the bad stuff.  This plot is more full of holes than Independence Day. I mean, it makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.  Other reviewers have said that if you go to this movie, you must be prepared to think.  Very true, you must think about the film's themes and the film's subtext every step of the way.  This was extremely interesting and enjoyable.  But whatever you do, please do not think about the plot.  It doesn't hold up under any scrutiny at all.  At a very basic level, this film doesn't make sense.  I can't elaborate without throwing out a huge spoiler, so I won't.If you ask me, plot is the first thing.  If you have a weak plot, that can be forgiven by other strengths.  But if your plot can't even stand up without the willful indulgence of a forgiving audience, then you've already fouled up too big to ignore.  This movie could not have been good without massive script alterations.  No matter how good the acting, how good the directing, how clever the dialogue, this movie could not have been other than a travesty of modern film.  Horrible.On the other hand, from the number of posters here who seem to think that Edward Norton's character was named Jack, it's quite clear that people indeed don't pay very close attention to films.  No wonder this film is so highly regarded.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Nice twist.
",spoiler,"Major spoilers. This movie will only get a two on my scale of one-to-ten because of the twist in the ending, and even the twist isn't all that great. People say this movie is great. Insightful. Exhilarating. I say it's complete trash and almost a waste of time. The characters aren't bad, except for that really ugly lady (change your hair and clean yourself up). She plays some psycho nymphomaniac who falls for Tyler Durden's (Brad Pitt) body. Eventually those two get together and have constant sex, which gets really old because the house is shaking all the time and the narrator explains how annoying it is. Soon the story gets boring and we find that the Fight Club is really a group of losers who are deviant maniacs bent on disrupting society. Let's face it, the only reason anyone should ever watch this movie all the way through is to find out that Tyler Durden is actually the narrator, and the narrator is Tyler Durden. Tyler Durden doesn't even exist. That twist really fell below the status of ""bad"". This movie really falls below the status of ""annoying, stupid, boring, disgusting, monotonous, and ridiculous"". The music reeks, the acting isn't great, the storyline is awful, the plot is stupid, and nothing fits together real well to make this movie solid.

" Solipsism hard at work
",,"It's amusing to see all the ""brilliant"" comments about this crap film. Fincher, a smoke and mirrors hack who is convinced that more is more, wants to sell you on the idea that we're living shallow lives. The proof's in the pudding here folks. He bashes you over the head with his ""themes"" like a college sophomore. He is a master of the odious, puerile 'wouldn't it be cool if this happened' school of story construction. The film is filled with desperate attempts at comedy, mostly of the gross-out, toilet variety - so no doubt the sub-20 dilettantes are enthralled - but the film is wall-to-wall form over substance. Most annoying are Fincher's pet signature moments - you'll see them in all his worthless work: mention a pilot light - and voilà, the camera flies around a stove and shows you a pilot light. Presumably he finds this is magical as he repeats it everywhere - but we know it's simply his unleashed attention whore personality being imposed where it doesn't belong. There's no need to 'spoil' the ending - it's obvious to any thinking person within the first 10 minutes what's going on.

" Don't Spit in the Soup, Watch UFC!
",spoiler,"Fight Club is incredibly over-rated. Why? It wasn't the the acting, which was very good, or the direction, which was also true to the story. The problem was with the story and then with the ""twist"" ending. The story had no resonance because, except for the beginning, it wasn't believable as fiction or fantasy. Once our hero (the narrator) moves in with Tyler Durden, everyone in the story serves only the plot elements without ever being believable in their actions.Other fantasy movies like The Matrix, LOTR, Memento, etc. manage to create a fictional world with somewhat believable characters. Some of them manage the ""twist"" ending very well. Memento's twist ending (or was it a twist beginning?) is excellent. Not Fight Club. It only piles on the absurdity.It's clear that the author is violently against materialism, against creature comforts, against middle class values. Hmmm, is he promoting the idea of fighting with others (or yourself) to be free? Naah, not really. Does he actually show the damage a bare knuckle fight would really do? Despite all the blood and relentless smashing of faces, the answer is no. Just a few new bruises the next day and ready for more fighting. Ha! And just what is the message? Blow up the system? Embrace anarchy? Join a cult (or Support Group)? Change the world by spitting (or spewing other bodily fluids) in restaurant food? Who really knows? Maybe it's a good way to let us enjoy lots of brutal violence and make us feel better because there is a valuable and deep philosophy there. Haha! If you want some good, healthy real fighting, watch Pride or UFC fights. After a brutal knock-out of an opponent, a UFC fighter was asked, ""Why do you do this?""

As to the acting, well I couldn't find anyone doing that here, but then Ed Norton is one of the worst actors alive today (as is Pitt), so you shouldn't be surprised there.

At least in this case, this qualifies as a 'so bad it's good' exercise, whereas the others were just mindless bores.  Of course, it's largely thanks to the incredibly bad acting of Ed Norton and Brad Pitt, who should form a triumvirate with Keanu Reeves as the most overpaid, talentless bunch of numbnuts ever to grace the screen with their lack of talent.  In fact, the only good performance here is by Meatloaf, which is saying a lot.  If you think the plot is original, it's not.  The same idea was presented in a half hour episode of 'Alfred Hitchcock Presents' over 30 years ago, that was directed by the master himself. Still, even if it was faked, I did greatly enjoy seeing Pitt and Norton beating each other to a bloody pulp.

The point of the movie (if there is one) is simply to entertain the audience.  If the director/screenwriter/producer/cast meant it to be deeper, it got lost in the parody.I will admit that I was very entertained by the performances of all the leads, and even Meat Loaf was fun to watch in his small role.  However, this does not make up for the fact that Fight Club tries to play with your mind and give a new spin on random subjects like mass media, masculinity/violence, and society when in fact it spreads itself too thin and through the conclusion of the movie completely sullies whatever decent arguments it had.Bottom line: Watch it for pure fun, no more.

" a dark comic male fantasia for the new millennium
",spoiler,"As we approached that totally arbitrary year 2000 it seemed Hollywood movies were becoming darker and more pessimistic, or at least (to be more accurate) were being marketed to give that impression. A perfect case in point was this violent, cynical fantasy about disenfranchised men getting even with an unsympathetic world by bonding together to beat the living pulp out of each other.It's called 'Fight Club', and Brad Pitt is the charismatic psychopath who kicks it (sometimes literally) into gear, enlisting insomniac everyman Ed Norton into a netherworld of black eyes and broken noses. Pitt only wants his otherwise mild-mannered new protégé to embrace his own dormant masculinity at its lowest and most honest level, and in a sense the eponymous club is presented like the ultimate touchy-feely support group, offering members the epiphany of uncomplicated pain as an antidote to the numbing monotony of modern life.But what begins as a strictly masochistic form of macho catharsis soon devolves into an underground skinhead cult promoting worldwide anarchy and destruction. And if, after reading that, you suspect this is where the plot gets derailed, give yourself a pat on the back and a blue ribbon for eagle-eyed film analysis.'Fight Club' is a disturbing movie, not least because it can, at times, be a lot of fun to watch, in an admittedly twisted sort of way. Viewers are invited to chuckle in sympathy at thoughtless acts of petty rebellion such as waiters urinating in the soup at pretentious uptown restaurants, or (my favorite) the 'homework' assignment asking club members to pick a fight at random with a total stranger, and lose – not an easy task, as it turns out. And let's face it: who among us hasn't entertained daydreams of demolishing a tacky piece of corporate public art or destroying a generic coffee franchise (or, better yet, accomplishing both at the same time)? Boys will be boys, but a lot of that guilty juvenile pleasure gets pushed aside when the anti-establishment vandalism turns to wholesale sabotage and terrorism. It's too bad, because elsewhere the film presents a canny dissection of the American male psyche: not an altogether pleasant topic, but certainly ripe for exactly this shade of black comic satire. Few other movies have dared to approach the same subject with such unblinking candor (the closest recent equivalent was probably Neil LaBute's 1997 feature 'In the Company of Men', a minor classic of y-chromosome misanthropy), and none with this degree of microscopic scrutiny.It even begins, pointedly, at a subatomic level, tracing the feverish sparking of nerve impulses across poor Ed Norton's sleep deprived synapses. From there the focus expands upwards and outwards, targeting all the usual suspects of our late 20th century social stalemate: the credit card economy, the empty consumer culture, the slow brain-death of a television habit (of course), the empty paycheck at the end of another dull day's meaningless labor. ""This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time"", says the desensitized Norton, a white collar wage slave unable to find any emotional release outside of other people's support networks: terminal cancer patients, adult survivors of childhood incest, alcoholics anonymous, and so forth.Until the fateful moment when he first crosses the path of kindred spirit/alter ego Tyler Durden, one of the more compelling anti-heroes (for better or worse) in recent screen memory, brought vividly to life in a typically extroverted performance by Brad Pitt. Durden is Norton's dark companion: a post-modern messiah preaching a gospel of enlightened self-destruction. ""Forget redemption"", he tells his disciples (although he doesn't actually use the word forget), ""we are God's unwanted children."" That's a lot of philosophy to swallow in one sitting, but over most of its (considerable) length the film successfully negotiates a precarious narrative tightrope between brilliance and pretension. Unfortunately the chosen method of discourse in the adapted screenplay by Jim Uhls is non-stop voice-over narration, the laziest tool in the arsenal any hack (and a pet peeve, to be sure). Movies work best when used as a model of visual, not verbal, expression, showing (or better yet, merely suggesting) the meaning of things, instead of artlessly spelling out the intended lesson in exactly so many words.To be fair, director David Fincher does his best to open up the format and have some fun with it, for example asking Norton to address the camera directly (spoiling Pitt's aim while he's peeing in the lobster bisque), and employing a typically hyperactive visual scheme stocked with every up-to-the-minute gimmick imaginable, all set to an effective electro-shock soundtrack by a team calling themselves The Dust Brothers. The sets are likewise dressed to the acme of stylish decay (an apparent specialty of Fincher), and attentive viewers will even catch some ultra-cool subliminal foreshadowing: strategic single frame inserts of Tyler Durden popping up at random, anticipating his first appearance by several scenes.But after setting up such a novel premise the script quickly runs out of first-person prose, having exhausted itself on hackneyed pearls of Occidental wisdom such as: ""the things you own end up owning you"", perfectly true, but hardly the most original observation. With nowhere else to go and nothing left to say, the story collapses quickly to a desperately over-plotted climax, losing the thread of its already subversive sexual aggression sub-text to foreground the 'Project Mayhem' conspiracy agenda, and finally introducing a ludicrous doppelganger dénouement too far-fetched for even an old Twilight Zone episode.Bottom line: it's a provocative movie at odds with its own ambition, leaning hard on a necessary crutch on black (bordering on tasteless) humor. Ignoring all the stylistic window dressing, the film is also more cynical, and in many ways more original, than anything since the pre-Lucas/Spielberg '70s: think of William Friedkin's 'Sorcerer', written for laughs. That, by itself, is enough reason to recommend it, but is this where one hundred years of screen art have brought us?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

""Fight Club"" directed by David Fincher and released two weeks later was its angrier, much more cynical counterpart. Adapted from Chuck Palenhuick's 1996 bestseller, ""Fight Club"" swaggered into cinemas to a lukewarm reception from critics, who found the film polarising and its violence gratuitous, exacerbated by the studio poorly thought out marketing campaign. Since then however, the film's reputation has gradually grown in esteem and is now regarded as one of the greatest films of the 90's. The film's themes still resonate today and I feel that it fares well when compared to its competitor, which seems soapy and melodramatic by comparison Whist I would agree that the film is a unique one, featuring stellar performances from Norton, Bonham Carter and Pitt and slick direction from Fincher, the film loses some of its acerbic potency slightly upon repeat viewings. Nevertheless it's more than apparent ""Fight Club"" will go down as one of the best movies of the late 20th Century and a landmark depiction of masculinity on film.Pitt's performance as Tyler Durden is undoubtedly the highlight of the film. Boasting an air of dangerous virility and later mocking, contemptuous threat, Durden will likely go down as one of cinema's most iconic male characters, up there with Eastwood's Blondie, De Niro's Travis Bickle and Pacino's Michael Corleone. Coming at the end of a seminal streak in the 1990's, Pitt delivers a powerhouse performance, playing the anarchic Tyler with rebellious aplomb. His chemistry with both Norton and Boham Carter are excellent, with Durden as the perfectly extroverted yin to Norton's much more introverted yang and his scenes with Carter crackling with sexual tension. Without a doubt, Durden is the films charismatic heart of darkness and Pitt deliver's in a truly exceptional performance. Norton's role as the anonymous, insomniac narrator is far more subdued compared to Pitt's but Norton's white collar everyman appeal gives the character a relatable appeal. Whist at times, the characters narration can seem dour and neurotic, Norton's anonymous nature makes him a more relatable protagonist then Kevin Spacey's Lester Burnham, and more sympathetic that Michael Douglas in ""Falling Down"". If anything, Norton's character feels more like Generation X's equivalent of Dustin Hoffman's Benjamin Braddock in ""The Graduate"" than Spacey's disillusioned baby boomer or Douglas's psychotic vigilante. If Pitt's anarchist soap salesman is the films dark heart, then Norton is its audience surrogate and ultimately the moral core.Among the supporting cast, the two undeniable stand outs are Helena Boham Carter as the nymphomaniac, destitute Marla Singer and Meat Loaf as Robert ""Bob"" Paulson, rather unfortunately endowed with a pair of ""bitch tits"". Here, Boham Carter plays a character a million miles removed from the quirky but increasingly stale characters she's played recently. A foul mouthed, nymphomaniac ""tourist"", Singer comes across as a interesting and unique love interest and yet, when at the end of the film she displays more typical romantic lead aspects, it feels true to character as opposed to suddenly jarring. Meat Loaf gives the role of Bob, a sense of humour and likability, in a role that could have easily lapsed into parody, which makes his eventual demise and martyr-fication by Project Mayhem all the more tragic.Fincher's past experience making stylish thrillers such as ""Se7en"" and ""The Game"" is clearly on display in ""Fight Club"". The fight scenes are brutal and gratuitous, not shying away from blood, sweat and disfigurement, but there's logic and reason behind them, as opposed to just being sequences designed to shock or disgust its audience. I feel that if the films fight scenes had not been as visceral as they are, then the films themes would have felt less effective and the film would have been criticised for not developing or exploring them enough. The film is shot through with a glossy sheen, which doesn't detract from the grittiness and brutality of the fight scenes .The more stylised sequences that are in the film however, are handled competently, sequences testament to Fincher's early experience directing music videos, with the film boasting several uniquely stylish and occasionally surreal sequences, from the title sequence depicting a brain's neural network in which the thought processes are initiated by the Narrator's fear impulse, to a disorienting, slow motion sex scene. On the downside, several of the more stylised, CGI heavy sequences now look dated, especially the latter. Whist the films themes may be timeless, evidently the CGI isn't. Thematically, ""Fight Club"" is not the first film to explore the ""modern man in crisis"" theme. Throughout the 1990's, we had several movies exploring that and similar themes, usually with sardonic observations on society and commercialism peppered throughout. ""Falling Down"" had sly observations on commercialism and advertising and Oliver Stone's ""Natural Born Killers"" explored the relationship between sensationalist media and violent serial killers. ""Fight Club"" tackles much of the same themes and whist it does it successfully, at times the films themes and messages tend to overwhelm the plot and frequently feel heavy handed. I felt the bar scene where Pitt explains his philosophy and views on commercialism to Norton was a subtler way of getting the films message across. Overall I would say ""Fight Club"" is certainly a unique film with a cynical, acerbic take on consumerist culture. Undoubtedly one of the best films of the late 20th Century and with an enduring male icon in the shape of Pitt's Tyler Durden, the film admittedly does lose some of its satirical bite upon multiple viewings with its message coming across as heavy handed. The films non linear plot line and cutaways can also feel repetitive after a while. The pro's however far outweigh the cons of Fincher's searing satire.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" One of the greatest movies ever made
",,"To be honest, I don't think it's possible to sum up the greatness that is Fight Club in one paragraph, but I shall give it a try. The film consists of a psychological and beautifully twisted plot, which captures your attention from the very first line. The characters are portrayed remarkably, and the main actors gave brilliant performances. The movie is quite difficult to grasp at first glance and you may need to watch it a few times to fully understand. However, this may just be my judgement. The film gives a different and more complex outlook on life, and how even the average human being can be haunted and controlled by the obscurity that is our mind. Your life won't be complete until you have watched Fight Club; it is one of those few films that will stay with you for the rest of your life.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Edward Norton went from being a big-built neo-Nazi (American History X) to being a footstool of corporate America in no time at all. Fair play to Helena Bonham-Carter, whose character changes in the minds of the viewer towards the end of the film, but who adds depth and humour to the film.The overall feel of this film, is one of rebellion.

" Summary of all
",spoiler,"Maybe it's me and some close friends who believe that this movie is above all. First, as my Buddie Sitki puts it, this is a men movie. Females of all ages(at least the ones I know), do not get the point at all. The ideas presented, losing all hope being freedom, slavery to consuming, how we were pumped all with the idea that we are all going to make pop stars and movie stars, were somehow in my mind and finally someone told it for me to the rest of the world. I am always troubled with the ideas like, that we are getting old and we need to do the things that we have not done before, we need to catch up with life, we must try everything we can, and we need to go on a vacation whenever it is a public holiday, we need to get a house, a car, a pension fund, after we have a house and a car and a pension fund we need to get a bigger house and a more luxurious car and a pension fund with greater pay. What is all the rush? Does every one have to sky dive? Does every one have to visit the Bahamas? Is there an end to having better of everything? Why don't we have the chance to enjoy the present status as it is, with our convenient house and car and PC and what ever?... We can not, because they need to make money. We are their paying population. Like the people stored in the ""Matrix"" for the electricity they provide. The same goes here. Everything around you has a purpose of utilizing you. At what ever level of making money you are, you still have financial troubles. I recall dreaming of making USD 5.000 a month will be fantastic in my early work life. Now I am making more than USD 5.000 a month and it is still not enough. I am 37 now. I remember the first commercial PC's. They used do come with 2 Mb of RAM, 120 Mb of Hard drive, with a 386 processor @ 200 Hz. Could you believe it? We could well use spreadsheets and word processors and do almost everything we wanted. Now ordinary cell phones have memory cards for 2 Gb. Why do we need all that memory space? Why can't we live without the cell phone itself? Do we really need to take pictures any time, do we really need to have tons of music walking with us? Why can't we simply use telephone boots to call people? We used to like a decade ago. Now I can't think of meeting with someone with him or her not having a cell phone. How can we find each other, the exact place and time? It seems impossible. How did we visit someone for the first time in any place. Now I am making like 5 calls, before finally finding the spot. Were we more clever in the past? Do we really need 12 million pixels of picture resolution? Are our eyes sophisticated enough for that? We could survive without 50 inch plasma or LCD's, which still could not deliver the picture quality of a moderate regular TV with the good old technology however cost like 10 to 20 times more. I don't want to be taken in a wrong way. I like technology and find it useful and support it. However, I think there is a fine line, where consuming becomes the major objective, beating the need. At that point I feel fooled. I went to a cell phone dealer the other day. Asked for a cell phone without a camera, no MP3 player, no blue-tooth. The guy looked at me, trying to understand if I am for real or not. Colleagues at work criticize me saying ""How could you even think about purchasing a cell phone without a camera at this time?"" It is the same in car industry as well. Why do we need Air conditioners, that could blow cold on the driver side, and hot on the passenger side? What kind of circumstances would require that kind of operation? If the passenger finds it cool, simply turn the passenger blower off. That 3 word abbreviations in the recent makes. Do they really help us to survive? There are like ten of them I heard, and none I really heard someone telling me helping them in a way, apart from anti-lock brakes. Can't we like have a car, which is an airbag itself? Once it senses the crash, it goes off and the car is totally surrounded by the airbag. This will cut the number of airbags in a car to one, from 20. The makes go bigger with each new model. The cars classified in mini segment have reached the dimensions of the middle segment of a decade ago. Writing long, I might have passed a comment on the movie, however I believe Fight Club, puts all these and much more into question. This is why I find it as the best movie ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" If you could see just one movie in your lifetime...
",,"A modern masterpiece, nothing short of cinematic genius. Saw this movie first in high school and no other movie, to date, has made the impact on me that Fight Club has. It's a philosophically insightful critique of western society. Not to mention the camera work and dialog are superb. When I first saw it I didn't even have to look to find out who the director was, the lighting simply screamed Fincher. Fincher will always be one of the best modern directors but this film is undoubtedly the high point of his career. Rarely does a film come along that truly pushes the boundaries set by society in the way that this one does. Already achieving cult status this movie, I have no doubt, will go down in history as one of the greatest films ever made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Totally awesome!
",spoiler,"I saw this movie for the first time at the age of 12, I therefore blame it almost entirely for my frail mentality. It is the reason the phrase 'dark and disturbing' was created; and it gets better with each viewing. Not only does Edward Norton give, in my opinion, his strongest performance, this film contains the most mind blowing plot in existence. Brad Pitt excels himself as Tyler Durden who is in fact Tyler Durden's imaginary 'friend'. If you haven't yet seen this movie I suggest you do so, at the earliest possible moment. In fact this movie is so good that it makes a scene with Helena Bonham Carter in a bridesmaid's dress whilst speaking in an American accent totally believable and completely enjoyable to watch. Plus the use of the phrase 'death hairball' would make it worth watching even if the rest of the movie was terrible (which it most definitely isn't).Just for the cherry on top of the giant violence fuelled movie; Meat Loaf is in it and has a pair of breasts with nipples the size of dustbin lids. :-)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The most significant movie in my life
",,"One night I decided to intrude into neighboring computers in the local dormitory network. Nothing personal, just looking for movies and mp3s. The very first file I came across was an avi version of ""Fight club"". It was a stroke of luck since all I could find in the next few months was almost worthless, but as for this movie - it was SO about time for me! The last thing I paid attention to is the fights proper. But I was appealed to this ingenious depiction of the suffocating atmosphere of contemporary consumerism and inability of an average person to lead a meaningful, and therefore satisfying, life. The movie deals with insomnia and its underlying causes, the charm and usefulness of self-destruction as well as the limitations of this approach. It also makes you wonder how far you would go with transforming your personality to avoid desperation, as opposed to changing yourself for the one you love. The picture radiates an unexpected healing power - neither due to the cinematographic merits per se, nor because of a happy ending or positive message. I suppose, at least for the actual target audience, it is the feeling you're not alone and there are many other ""lost souls"" out there choking and coping with it just the way you do. For me and a good friend of mine the movie actually meant accepting our attitude towards existence and trying to live up to this perception. We often found each other drinking and watching the movie simultaneously when one emailed his buddy and passed him a reflection that occurred to his mind during the film. Now this period is over but we still know many episodes by heart and keep a very warm feeling to the movie for all it gave us then. I guess there is no need to discuss the excellent work by David Fincher and the cast  the well-earned praises abound elsewhere. But I do highly recommend finding the script by Jim Uhls (available in the internet) and purchasing a double DVD set. The extras, such as ""This is your life"" music video, render it an excellent bargain.Go ahead and watch the movie. It's not about fighting others; it's about challenging your life of convenience and compromise. Watch, then think, then watch again. Just like that special ""Paper street soap"" by Tyler Durden, it both feels good on the skin and it actually cleanses you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" And I thought it was a ""Van Damme-style"" action movie...
",,"I won't write a lot about this film, mainly because my English is very poor, but also because the most important things about ""Fight Club"" were said and written in previous comments. What I'd like to state here is: I sat down one night in front of my TV set and started watching ""Fight Club"", because I really hadn't anything better to do that very night. I remember I thought ""it should be another ""Van Damme-style"" action movie, with a bunch of tough guys trying to beat the crap out one to another, with the power of their fists"". Well, the title didn't gave me any hope of getting something better. The movie started and the fights didn't, at least for a long while. What i saw was a very philosophical movie that captured my attention from the very beginning to the very end. And yes, if I expected for some action, the action was there too... but just as an exclamation mark, to enforce the whole idea of the film. And when I reached the final scene, I didn't have a single doubt about it: it was the perfect end to such a great movie. Thanks, Lord, for not giving to me anything better to do that night that sit in front of my TV set and watch a movie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" The Best Movie Ever Made
",,"As soon as I watched Fight Club at a friends house sometime in the year 2000, after it was released, I was amazed and fascinated by it. Fight Club is truly a film of the 21st century, revealing all the flaws in modern day society and bluntly verifying, challenging, and exhibiting philosophical ideas while enlightening all who watch it.Undoubtely, this movie faced much criticism in-part because it challenged the structure of society itself. The concept of giving up all hope is freedom is one of the best, and all extra subtle philosophies offered, and the experience of the movie itself is just truly a masterpiece. Fight Club was based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, who is the best modern novelist in the world. With no positive answers for anyone, this movie offers an inner satisfaction of destructive concepts.The collaboration which is perfect for the development of this film was great because it had superb acting from both Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter, and especially Edward Norton (Edward Norton who enjoys making dysfunctional films). The film had a great connection between director David Fincher who incorporated his fantastic CGI abilities to the film along with the genius of novelist Chuck Palahniuk. Chuck Palahniuk who should be equally praised as well, writes in 1st-person narrative, with short-sentences and sentences contrasting with detail, pin-pointing perfection, Palahniuk expresses his dark (very unique) 1st-person experience in his book.Fight Club is a film that will be misunderstood by many, but from those who do understand it, will get too experience a contemporary masterpiece that reveals a true evolution in all ideas the lie in the destructive side of humanitarian spectrum.10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A movie better than its book
",,"I first saw Fight Club about two years ago.  Of course, I loved it.  I own the soapbox DVD.  So when the time came for me to choose some reading material last summer, I picked the book to read and see how it compared. I actually liked the movie better than the book.  I think it is better than the book, something that does not happen often (see Jurassic Park, both versions of Red Dragon, many Stephen King translations to film, etc.)The book is definitely unique.  It is told like the poems the Narrator reads about Jack's organs.  It is a lot of first person dialogue from a guy you are sure is a wimp.  I think the movie improves on it by the gimmicks like the changeovers and frames inserted.  Moreover, I feel the ending to the book was rather lacking and disapointing (maybe because of the great ending to the movie).  Most importantly, I think the movie emphasizes the actual Fight Club/Project Mayhem aspect better.  It is a major source of conflict in the film, while more of a backdrop in the book.  The book is more of an exploration of the relationship with Marla and the narrator's state of mind. It's also very short (if you try, you can read it in a day), while the movie is over two hours long.  If you read the book, you'll see a lot of the dialogue is lifted from there, but I think some of the quotes from the movie are snappier (the ""I want to have your abortion"" line on the alternate take found on the DVD is from the book, but the line ""I haven't been f**ked like that since grade school"" is just hilarious.)  About the only scene I could see from the book making the movie better/funnier is Tyler cooking Marla's mom's collagen ""gift.""The movie's very deep.  We, the audience, see characters in the same light as the Narrator does as the movie progresses.  Though Tyler seems to be the perfect buddy and collaborator, we all soon find him to be just a psycho and the liberated space monkeys as lemmings.  The despised Marla (I am Jack's raging bile duct) we all come to find endearing... somehow. 10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Male identity in the 1990s
",,"No spoilers here, but this may be a comment for those who've seen Fight Club and are thinking about watching it again.After looking past all the violence, extreme cinematographic techniques, computer-enhanced images, and other tricks Fight Club plays on us, we see another level to this film.  It's a show about young men trying to find their place in society at the end of the 1990s.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt play a couple of typical guys in typical situations for men of their age, with no idea where to go with their lives. (Okay, you can argue that Pitt's character isn't so typical, and that he has some idea what to do.  I'd say he's only about a half-step ahead of Norton.) These guys went through school, graduated college, and got normal, thoughtless jobs (jobs, not careers) because they felt it was expected of them.  Now they don't know what's expected of them.  Their fathers are gone--can no longer tell them what to do.  They've been confronted with opposing images of what constitutes a man all their lives--the cold, power-hungry yuppie; the sensitive, caring friend to the environment; the politician that cheats and lies to the people he represents; the attractive actor/model who don't seem to be capable of having an original thought.They're finally coming to a point (and this is where Pitt is ahead of Norton) where they have to figure out what _they_ want to do with their lives, or give up live by these images society presents them.
Convinced that real life and growth come about from conflict, they start fight club.  Norton and Pitt's characters discover that in this repressed, politically-correct society, the best way to really know yourself, the only way to really grow, is through conflict.  They fight to see what they're capable of giving out and taking.  They fight to conquer each other, but more importantly to conquer themselves.  They fight to recognize each other as human beings and to gain respect for themselves and each other. Whether you're offended by the violence or not, you have to appreciate the symbolic importance of the conflict here.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Some thoughts...
",spoiler,"*SPOILERS AHEAD*Ok, I don't want to tell people what they should think and what they shouldn't, but I have to say it. There... about the twist in Fight Club, there's something that a previous user (as well as some other users) are obviously missing.There are numerous hints that become apparent after a couple of viewings which suggest that the narrator only partially acts out as Tyler. One of the scenes is the one with Raymond K. Hassel, the clerk that he threatens with a gun. Rewatching that scene, a couple of things become clear:a) There are blurred boundaries between ""when"" Tyler actually talks and when Tyler's talking is just an illusion in the narrator's mind. Raymond answers some questions, yet a couple of times the narrator has to do the talking for Tyler, as apparently Raymond didn't hear what Tyler just said. What does that tell us? That in these small fragments the narrator failed to bring out Tyler. In other words, in these small fragments Tyler wasn't ""acted out"" by the narrator. When they are alone (they practically never talk to each other in public), the narrator is having a conversation with himself in his mind, but he's not speaking out loud, as he doesn't need to act out Tyler.b) The same is true for the scene in the car. There are fragments where Tyler speaks out loud on behalf of the narrator, but again, the boundaries are not defined, since the whole film is the subjective view of a man suffering from ""dissociative"" psychosis: the narrator ONLY partially acts out as Tyler. This is not just to justify why the space monkeys in the back answer Tyler's question. Fincher, I believe (and I've been watching the movie a lot, to see if there are flaws on this) paid particular attention to this, and it came out well. In fact, the whole conversation that the narrator and Tyler have in the car is just an illusion in the narrator's head, as he's not speaking out loud except in a couple of fragments. The couple of fragments where he's speaking out loud are, apparently, where emotions are prevailing (the narrator screaming ""I wanna know certain things first""): the ""wall"" that he has built in his subconscious to permit him not to ""act out"" the two personalities is torn down for a small fragment of time. When one of the two personalities is specifically addressing questions to an external person, of course, he doesn't need this ""wall"", so he can act out one of the two personalities.Another thing... Fight Club doesn't attempt to give answers to the question it raises; in particular, doesn't portray the fight club, Project Mayhem and Tyler himself as the underlying philosophy that one should follow. This becomes more and more obvious through the movie, the final twist being the ultimate proof of the irrationality of these solutions. Sorry, but it bothers me a little that one refuses the validity on the twist on the whole and then blames the movie for being ""empty"".I say that the movie righfully does not offer solutions (there's only a brief hint in the end about *love*): let's face it, no matter how long, a movie can not support the weight of such heavy questions as the role of society and the equilibrium of the human in it. But the movie addresses heavy criticism about what consumerism portrays as ""happiness"". I say -- in this, Fight Club succeeds in spades.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" This movie is overrated
",,"The Fight Club movie, like its more successful but equally troubled cousin The Matrix, has some philosophical themes, originality in presentation, and is also strong on satire. Another movie that it is similar in some ways is vastly superior and more intelligent and fun American Psycho. The plot is adapted from the eponymous book, which ""borrows"" ideas from Dostoevsky's ""The Double"" and puts some ""Thus spoke Zarathustra"" along a way. It is derivative and not very good, certainly not as good as its cult followers would suggest. In any case, given the hype, I was expecting more. There are some good points along the way - especially its anticipation of terrorism, and some good transformational scenes, like when confronting a boss, but overall, it comes across as much more shallow than its reputation would suggest. It is high on style and influence, has lot of ideas crammed in and it might have been even revolutionary in some respects for its time (like the Matrix, which I also find a bit missing), so perhaps its worth a watch, but it is not a perfect masterpiece some assume it is. It may seem so to perhaps teens, incels and millenials, but this is not the most successful nor sophisticated rendering of such ideas. Tone your expectations down, give it a try, this is a movie that can work in bits and pieces, has originality, but is sometimes given WAY too much credit.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Cult Classic
",,"As a dude, I feel obliged to watch this movie at least once a year. No seriously, it's good for your testosterone levels.I first watched Fight Club in high school, and although I didn't get it at first, I've been watching it ever since with increasing pleasure. Arguably David Fincher's best movie for a multitude of reasons, namely that sweet blend of dark humor, violence, and bad-ass performances by the actors.Cinematography is great, even though the special effects are sometimes questionable/dizzying/cheesy, it never seems to bother me; call me nostalgic, I think it just adds to the overall flavor of the film.People kinda either hate or love this movie. Either way, if you haven't seen it yet, something's wrong with you.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" One Of The Most Remarkable Films Ever Made.
",,"Fight Club Is without a doubt the craziest film I have ever seen. The twist in the film was spoiled for me so I won't spoil it for any of you guys. It took me way too long to finally watch this film and I regret not watching it earlier, it stars my favourite actor, Edward Norton, who's performance in American History was jaw dropping and another great actor known as Brad Pitt who stars in se7en which is also directed by David Fincher. Fight Club see's a no named man known as The Narrator (Edward Norton) go through his life dealing with insomnia. During this remarkable journey he meets a man called Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on plane. After an accident which causes The Narrator's apartment to explode, then leads to him living with Tyler. After a night of drinking, the two drunk friends then start to fight each other, however, it isn't a fight to do with hate, the two remain friends. They fight once again after another night of drinking but this time they are spotted. The two that found Tyler and The Narrator fighting then ask if they can join in, this leads to more and more people joining in. They decided to call it Fight Club. I won't go any further as I don't want to ruin the story for anyone. Fight Club is probably my favourite film of all time and it should be watched ASAP. The acting and story make Fight Club arguably one of the greatest films ever made. I give Fight Club 5 stars.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?""
",,"You know, it's hard sometimes when you see this extremely thought- provoking movie that thought-provokes you SO much, that you have no idea how to start your review. Other movies have hit me in some emotional way, but Fight Club did it in a secretive way. A way that I don't know what exactly hit me, but I know something hit me.. So instead of blabbering on about how much it 'hit' me, how about getting into actual stuff?The acting was surprising from both leads. Brad Pitt surprises me left & right, but this was the first time where I saw Edward Norton, and thought: ""wow, he CAN act!"" And he rightfully can. The plot, at first glance, may seem like your typical boxing movie that adds in one new thing and stamps itself ""the best movie ever."" Well that's not the case. In the first ten minutes, I thought I was watching an entire different movie. Edward Norton narrates every little thing he does, sees, or thinks. It was a really strange set-up, but the strangeness was intriguing.. Then there's the people who bash this film because they find out the twist, finding it silly. I'm sure none of these people ever heard of multiple personality disorder? I thought it was a surprising twist. And for a film like this? A fantastic twist...But plot, characters, acting, directing, sound design, cinematography, and screenplay do even qualify to compete with this film's brilliance. Strangely enough, you don't even know what was so brilliant about it. You just know that something was there that made you go ""wow"" and think and think. That's film-making.. But the whole atmosphere of the movie, the whole directorial style Fincher creates, is mystifying. He has created this genre that I can't even get a grasp on. And it contains philosophical elements as well, which further enhance the underlying brilliance of it all... And Fight Club also works as a comedy. A dark, dark comedy. Some parts are so devilish evil that you can't help but smile. Need more? Fight Club works as a counterpart. Let me rephrase. It works as a study. It works as a masterpiece. Everything and anything the movie contains was surely not what you'd expect. ""Fight Club."" You hear those words and think another attempt at creating yet another boxing movie. No depth, no substance. But when you see it, you'll understand. You'll understand a lot more of everything...Fight Club is much more an audience film than it is a critic's film. Critics rate the film itself, not even attempting to appreciate it's social commentary or it's brilliant message to the world. But I did. You will too. Fight Club competes with cinematic classics. It works as everything it's not. It's a favorite of mine. A brilliant, clever film. A film that will engage you with it's warm embrace. To have you reconciling every bit and piece. So what are you doing reading this review on the internet? Get off your lazy ass, and get out there. Do something with your life. While your sitting here doing nothing but reading this film, people are appreciating this film, while you are just reading the synopsis, trying to understand something you can't. Signed, Tyler Durden.10/10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fantastic, A must see
",,"Chuck Palahniuk creates thrilling, captivating works for the mind of his readers. He is the author of 14 novels, two of which have already been made into movies and three other novels being considered or already in production to be major motion pictures. The first of Palahniuk books to move to film was Fight Club. Fight Club is a gripping page-turner unable to be put down until you realize you've read through the entirety of it in one sitting. Luckily, the movie held true to the book and might've even done a better job telling the story of Tyler Durden. The twisting thriller keeps you suspended until it blows your mind. The actors in Fight Club carry the movie fantastically; Edward Norton as the narrator, Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden, and Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer. Norton narrates as a character in the movie that moves in a run down house with Tyler Durden and then shares the life of Tyler Durden with the viewers. Marla Singer, the antagonist works her way into their lives, driving them crazy. To unleash their building frustration and deal with their excess testosterone, Norton and Pitt create what they call ""Fight Club"". ""The first rule of Fight Club is do not talk about Fight Club."" The subtle hints in this film foreshadow beautifully. Small special effects and the ability to physically see the raise of an eyebrow or hear the narration while watching a fight scene actually happen add up to effectively blow your mind and make you question how you didn't see anything coming. The director, David Fincher, certainly shows his skill through this film. Seeing Fight Club and another of his dark, intense movies, Seven, it's simple to day this man has a unique vision. Fight Club is a must see. 10/10!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The most thought provoking movie ever!!!
",,"When I watched this movie for the first time,It was just another movie with some looser narrator trying to change his life. When I watched it again I started realizing the layers of this AMAZING movie.And now this is my favorite movie ever after GODFATHER. The narration with its DARK HUMOUR is absolutely amazing.Hats Off to David fincher for his visual style. The quotes in this movie are amazing, the ones like ""We are a generation of men raised by women,I don't think another women is the answer to my problem"".And the best part is the Awesome Twist in the end,The Twist would have been a clichéd one if it was not for the script writer and the director.

Amazing performances from Edward Norton and especially Brad Pitt.

" Fincher's best
",spoiler,"I saw this some 10 years ago when it first came out and I may have seen it in between then and now, but I couldn't remember. Having just watched Seven recently I thought it was time to revisit Fight Club. For it's day Fight Club stood out as a hugely original piece of film making. Utilizing brilliant techniques and special effects, it was quite something to witness. 10 years later, the film still holds it's own. It truly is a great film and stands out among a Hollywood filled with mediocre. Knowing the outcome, that Tyler is not real, makes a second viewing a altogether new experience, as the viewer finds themselves aware of scenes with the key characters in and figuring out how or where it is possible to have the characters and their actions work. The cast is fine in this, I especially liked Helena Bonham Carter in this. The visual elements make for a great film experience as well: The explanation of the explosion in the apartment: the appearance of Ikea furniture: the decrepit house and the airplane ripping apart are many of the stand out moments. There is some graphic violence, but it never seems to get too violent, despite it's nature.There are also some great film making in jokes: love the subliminal images of Tyler and as Tyler describes it 'flashback humour' when at the end the film continues on from it's opening scene.For today's world of 'Avatar' film making Fight Club remains a stand out piece of film making which is at times brutal, at others funny as hell. Combine this with some brilliant techniques and you have a terrific film and probably Fincher's best.More reviews at my site iheartfilms.weebly.com.au",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Amazing Satire and Philosophy
",,"Undeniably one of the best films of the tremendous cinematic year that was 1999, David Fincher's Fight Club is a cultural landmark. Chuck Palahniuk's acerbic first novel (and still the best the 5 of his books that I've read) is visualized with Fincher's stylistic creativity and the result is a modern classic.Edward Norton plays a white collar stiff, whose life is so nondescript that he is known only as The Narrator. He acknowledges that he is mired in shallow consumerism; a slave to the ""IKEA nesting instinct."" He is also an insomniac and can only find catharsis and sleep after sitting in on 12-step program meetings for dying people. This strategy fails, however, when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) pulls the same stunt and ruins the reality that he has found. After an explosion that destroys the narrator's apartment, he moves in with soap salesmen and revolutionary Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Together, they start an underground society in which men reject civilization and unleash their primal urges upon each other.Fight Club is often described as anti-consumerism or anti-establishment. There are, however, two less talked about ideas that I take away from it. The first is the conflict between biology and society. Sitting on a bus, the protagonists see a rather gaudy advertisement for Gucci underwear. Durden asks derisively, ""Is that what a man looks like?"" I would argue that it is the insidious nature of the consumer culture, that it actually emasculates men by tapping into their male drives. It is the natural role of the male to be the hunter/gatherer, so buying things has become the modern incarnation of this. Another example of this interplay occurs when the narrator described how his father would leave his family to start a new one every six years. ""Setting up franchises,"" says Durden. Interestingly, the behavior described here does approximate the behavior of human males, pre-civilization. The short average duration of modern marriages suggests the hard-wired nature of this behavior. The fight club, however, is an outright rejection of modern society, in which men revel in short bouts of non-lethal violence, perhaps as they were meant to. When these urges are bottled up, it may not be too much of a stretch to suggest that the result can be wars and genocide.There are also, I believe, religious implications to the fight club and to Project Mayhem. Tyler Durden's philosophy seems to be part anarchism and part determinism, behaviorism and materialism (in the metaphysical sense; certainly not in the consumerist sense). He is about three parts B.F. Skinner and one part Henry David Thoreau. It is those facets of Skinner-type philosophy that are of the most interest to me and that Durden espouses most fervently. Like any good materialist, he utterly rejects the notion that human beings have any special worth. He extols to his followers: ""You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You are the same decaying organic matter as everything else... We are all part of the same compost heap."" Yet ironically, in supposedly freeing his followers from consumerism, he makes them slaves to his own purposes. They are shaved to become like the oft-mentioned sacrificial ""space monkeys."" They are removed of their names (this has a very anti-Christian feel to, since the having of and giving of names by humans is considered an important gift from God among the most meticulous followers of that religion). ""Sooner or later we all became what Tyler wanted us to be,"" says the narrator. Durden also expropriates the idea of 'hitting bottom' as the beginning of salvation (the 12-step program is a fundamentally religious construct), further casting him as a sort of Anti-Christian. B.F. Skinner suggested that understanding the science of human behavior was the key to controlling that behavior benevolently. Similarly, Durden exerts control over his followers for what he believes are good ends. Whatever the merits of those ends, there is no doubt that Tyler, in some ways, becomes very much like the corporate fascists he despises.Finally, Fight Club is a definitively 'male' movie. This is neither good nor bad, but it is undeniable. The character of Marla is entertaining, but almost entirely defined by her relationship to the two male protagonists. The picture would have almost worked without her. The idea of castration is presented as a deeply held male fear and is used skillfully throughout the movie. If we can take one thing away from this film, it would be the danger of denying the difference in biology between males and females. Males have a need for some level of violence and it is important that we have acceptable outlets for it. Conversely, it is interesting to take note of some of the ways in which society attempts to homogenize the sexes. Take the idea of ""paternity leave"" for new fathers - it's great in theory and it should certainly be an option, but I can almost guarantee that it will never become the norm, because it is a practice that is just so contrary to our deeply ingrained biological drives. To deny this is the height of naivety and will do no one any good.Overall, Fight Club makes my top 10 list for superb acting (especially by Norton, the best American actor of his generation), great humor and satire and its excellent script, thanks largely to the excellent source material. To conclude, I'll quote the deterministic, yet strangely comforting words of Chuck Palahniuk, from near the end of Fight Club (the book): ""We are not special. We are not crap or trash either. We just are. We just are, and what happens just happens.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" This movie is beyond perfection
",,"This is the kind of movie that when it ends your not really sure what to think about it but after a couple of days you totally love it and want to see it over and over again. Seeing Fight Club is an experience totally new for everybody, there is no other movie like it and there will never be, not until i´m guessing 10 years more. Because thats the time it´s gonna take (i hope) to people to understand the movie and really understand it. If students of film making are now studying Kubrick i´m sure they will study David Fincher in the future. Fight Club has great speed, in dialogues and actions, it has a great cast (even Meat Loaf was good) and most important it was deep, so deep that nobody notice it was deep because the deepiness of Fight Club is beyond tears and silences like the usual deep movies. If you don´t know what movie to watch, rent Fight Club, if you already saw it and didn´t like it, rent Fight Club",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" It's not the concept, it's the way the film presents it
",spoiler,"Fight Club is that one film you always hear about in colleges and universities, hailed as some sort of 'stick it to the man rebellion' story with all these pretentious meanings that apparently need to be analyzed in great depth to the point where I can't start a conversation about films without hearing Fight Club come up at least once. Pseudo-intellectuals, perverts, frat boys and emos all get obsessed with this one like moths to a flame. Of course, it would be the most spoiled, coddled and secure of society's demographic that enjoy Fight Club because they say it speaks so much to the hurt and anger they apparently experience on a day-to-day basis. I'm sure they'd change their tune and perhaps value humanity over themselves more if they'd grown up in earlier eras, but that's getting rather off-topic.Fight Club is not a terrible film. It has interesting characters, a decent plot and it follows the original book very well. The soundtrack is dated, the themes are dated, the dialogue is vulgar simply for the sake of being vulgar, and the entire thing as a whole is just trying way too hard to appeal to a certain type of entitled, self-absorbed and immature Generation X/ Millennial crowd (although really I think films are subjective and can be enjoyed by anyone). Fight Club is offensive in every sense of the word, disgustingly crass at times, weird, overly long, and yet I still liked it - but I think it's incredibly overrated for what it is, and I don't think the viewers of it really seem to grasp the full idea it was trying to put out there.The film is more or less a very nihilistic portrayal of a young man rebelling against modern corporate capitalism and society in general by forming an underground fight club with his SPOILER ALERT!!! imaginary friend and alter-ego Tyler Durden. Durden is a character, but at the same time an embodiment of everything bad, wasteful, annoying, volatile, cruel, narcissist and utterly pointless albeit intellectual that the main character himself is putting out into the world by his own attitude. Anarchy and rebellion, and the aftermath of them, remains one of the biggest themes in Fight Club alongside being an entertaining comedy. However, many viewers of the film just pick up on the vulgar one-liners about women and masturbation and sex, the heavy violence and Tyler's selfish view that humans exist to please themselves, not to care about others, and that the world, everything and everyone in it is just a game to be played. Viewers of Fight Club I've noticed retain the idea that if you show emotion, compassion, pity, sadness or kindness, you're an overly sensitive baby. ""Real men"" cause chaos, have sex constantly, swear their mouths off, go out of their way to offend others and don't give a damn about anyone else but #1. And naturally, when the main character grows up and matures slightly in the end, people find this confusing. Basically, the main character thought he knew how cruel and ugly the world was, but he was just a bored kid and a hypocrite. In fact, the majority of young adults are hypocrites who think the world revolves around them and their views. I was that way when I was that age, too. I went through a ""pro-pollution"" phase where I littered on purpose and refused to recycle. Why? Just to stir up trouble. I went through a goth phase where I wore black lipstick and thick black eye makeup to make a panda bear green with envy. Why? Just for shock value and to tick off my teachers. I went through an emo phase, cutting my arms with plastic cutlery and dying my hair black with pink streaks, listening to depressing music and whining about being depressed, while the popular blonde cheerleader sitting in the desk next to mine really WAS suicidal and it went totally unnoticed. Why? Because I was too wrapped up in my own teenage angst garbage to bother helping anyone or anything else. I wanted attention, I wanted to be noticed, but looking back on it a few years later, I realize how insignificant it all is. All teenagers are dumb. I have never come across an intelligent teenager. I've come across many intellectual teenagers, but not intelligent ones. Durden is exactly the figure most teenagers, teenage guys and college guys especially, emulate....Okay, that's really getting repetitive now. Like the films 'Donnie Darko' and 'A Clockwork Orange', I think the themes of chaos, nihilism and anarchy are important, but Fight Club is so overrated for what it is. How it has such a high rating over films like 'The Killing Fields' and 'Threads', I'll never understand. Reviewers keep raving about its aesthetics and its depth, but it's no more deep than many other films. ANY film with a social commentary is considered ""deep"". Fight Club I think just hit the world at the right time, plus it's making a comeback for many nostalgic hipsters, so it will definitely continue to be highly regarded for many years to come, which is not necessarily a bad thing, yet Fight Club shares what, exactly, with the world? Young adults are jerks? Have I missed some vital bit of info to make Fight Club so popular and beloved, or what?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Love it, don't need any reason

I had heard buzz about, a few of my  friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced. I should  see this movie. I went to my local video store and picked up the last  remaining DVD. I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit  rolled, and then watched it again. And again. And again.  This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and  stylistic. I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my  eyes away. Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern  consumer- driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and  Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).

" Edgelord ego fuel

However, too many grown men take this movie seriously and fawn over its wholly unremarkable and tedious semi-philosophical implications. In fact, I would recommend using this movie as a metric to avoid obnoxious people before you become too involved with them.The movie takes nearly two and a half hours to say ""work sucks!!! no one pays attention to me at the office!!! everyone around me is a chump!!!"" which would be just fine except that the movie is so incredibly misogynistic. The only woman in the movie with any role in the plot is Helena Bonham Carter's character who exists solely as an object of Edward Norton's fantasies. This kind of narrative is entirely unnecessary and at best mind numbingly boring (if not dangerous to an individual's perceptions of women and femininity). The values and glorifications in this movie are toxic and shallow.Not to mention how utterly unbelievable this whole story is. Why in the world would grown men want to just spend their time fighting each other? Why would a group of guys leaving a bar want to join in a fight that they came across in the street? Why would men who did enjoy fighting make the whole affair into a nihilistic cult? None of that is ever explained; we're meant to take for granted that men would just be interested in fighting for no discernible reason other than they're unhappy with their employment and credit scores.This movie was made by and for pretentious self involved clowns and an undeniable waste of time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The acting, by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton in particular, is quite good; the two stars have obviously been put through the wringer in their roles, and director David Fincher keeps cranking up the tension and puts us through the wringer as well.

" So Pretentious . So Overblown . So Overrated
",spoiler,"!!!! POSSIBLE SPOILERS !!!!!The premise of a lonely aimless soul attending cancer therapy groups and AA meetings might have been savagely funny if done right but here it`s badly executed as the first 20 minutes is taken up with Ed Norton droning on in an over literary voice over . I know a cinematic masterwork like APOCALYPSE NOW used voice over but so did THE DUKES OF HAZZARD so it`s just as likely to be the work of a buffoon than a genius . The themes of male grief , alienation and the back lash against 80s consumerism are just as badly developed 
FIGHT CLUB is good in parts like the scene where the members cover a car park with bird seed so that the pigeons s*hit all over the new cars , but the film is unworthy of the praise lavished upon it by large sections of IMDB voters . I can imagine 17 year old males loving this film - I`d be shocked if they didn`t - but for anyone else who`s old enough to have more mature and critical views should be able to recognise this as one extremely overlong overrated one trick pony . As for the metaphysical twist ending it just doesn`t make sense and brings the whole proceedings down . The narrator was beating himself up was he ? Yeah right .If FIGHT CLUB is the masterpiece  it`s supposed to be then how come it was virtually ignored at the Oscars in one of the weakest years for films in a long time ?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Criminals should have time taken off their sentence, if they can sit through this more then once. Some great movies do need to be seen 2 or 3 times to understand everything, and it is worth it. Obviously not this. Someone thought they were being real dynamic, deep, brilliant putting this ""thing"" together. When they were on LSD it seemed like the answer to the meaning of life. When they came down it was silly nonsense. Too late, the film was ""in the can"". It belongs in an ashcan. I am sure there are many people who put this in a cult classic category. They are on drugs, and not even watching it. The film actually would have been much better, if it was another underground fight movie, without the way overboard trying to be deep and multi faceted art. It is not.

" The things you own ends up owning you.
",,"What's fascinating in David Fincher's work,is that it seems we deal with an auteur.He created his own universe,a nocturnal and filthy one,and a bit misogynous too:it's glaring in this movie;outside Bonham-Carter-made look ugly and dressed as a 1977 punk-,only a black woman has a line to say.Almost everywhere,it is a man's man's world where no women appear even in the settings.This movie was influenced by famous and not-so-famous predecessors:of course ""Dr Jekill and Mister Hide"" to which Bonham Carter hints at in the restaurant,""a clockwork orange"" ,""rebel without a cause"" ""bad influence"" and Joel Schumacher's ""falling down"",the latter seems with hindsight to have been overlooked and underrated.So why does this movie seem so original?it owes a lot to E.Norton (more than Pitt)who had already overshadowed R.Gere in ""primal fear"".Here he plays a very strange kind of peeping tom:watching mental suffering (therapy groups ,dealing almost essentially with male problems),then physical sufferings,eventually enduring them.Does he do that as he would opt for yoga,Buddhism or psychotherapy,to escape from a routine work?To get free from the material world?As Pitt says ""the things you...""The problem is that Norton does not seem to be so free.At first,he may be, when he's only a simple spectator-and the scenes in the restaurant and in the projection room are peaks of black humor-,but,he's potentially a Stevensonian hero.There's a big coup de theatre in this movie, a breathtaking and unexpected twist ,à la ""sixth sense"" ,""Jacob's ladder"" or"" Usual suspects"" ,and it's difficult to comment this movie :all you say is questioned when you KNOW.Of course I won't reveal it,but I think it's the biggest flaw of the movie.Unlike the three mentioned works,this does not seem logical,because of the lack of ""clues"":the only one ,regarding Bonham-Carter, is not really convincing.The last picture seems now terrifying.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Among other themes in other films, I've seen the two identities thing done much better in David Lynch's Lost Highway and feel American Psycho did the male alienation in corporate America thing in a subtler (and funnier) way. Fight Club seemed so straightforward and obvious that I felt like the director was 'dumbing it down' for me, almost insulting my intelligence...I don't know, maybe it's just my taste.I'm glad so many people did get so much out of it though, that is one of the most important criteria for a film to have to be considered great, so I guess this is a great film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Films where his talent is actually apparent! I sat until the end of the film thinking ""Ok, anytime soon it will get exciting!"" It was so obvious they way the film was going to go and took a very long time to get there. Why anyone would cast Helena Bonham Carter is also beyond me!

" Fascinating piece
",,"It is quite rare thing that movie may be better than the book it is based on. And Fight Club actually is. I have watched it many times, the shrill still there, while the book gathers dust on a shelf. I read the book in English and in Russian (BTW the translation, at least the one I got in hand, sucks). By its sctucture it is very easy to be turned into a script exactly like it should be POV the narrator; OTOH it's not rich with descriptions, visuals are rather scanty. So I think the director and the cast did a perfect job to make movie pretty close to the book in pace, action and picture, giving the story greater power and subtlety by the means of cinematography; with one caveat - the ending. I know many people like the film ending and Palanniuk himself was quoted to prefer it. But it really doesn't make sense to me and makes the story more surreal and more shallow than one might digest.The acting is superb. Both Pitt and Norton are at their best and though I am not much into Helena Bonham Carter, she is amazing as Marla. Supporting characters are all well done, too. I also always love change of color scheme into sepia once we get into the Paper street world. Many things like that, you just must see it. It's an excellent film that will blow your mind anyway.That said, I am far from thinking this movie (and the book whatever) to be anything of a message. It is indeed thought-provoking but it actually doesn't offer a solution, nor a hint. Quite contrary it shows how much more preferrable the existing system would be comparing to the offered ways to get up at it. This rebellion without a cause, within the system, against its most obscure and superficial features is just a childish tantrum. That will pass and that is sad. BTW I would really like those many posters who state the movie changed their lives, to specify - how exactly? Oh wait I guess. They must have been purchasing Che Guevara t-shirts. Those do look nice with CK briefs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Self help to the extreme.
",spoiler,"A dark comedy with a cult following. Director David Fincher takes Chuck Palaniuk's novel to maybe a harsher and dangerous place. Known only as The Narrator(Edward Norton)is a corporate employee that is no longer enchanted by his elaborate apartment and its expensive furnishings and pretty much disenfranchised from life itself and is concerned with his lack of ability to sleep. He attends self-help groups to relish in not being as miserable as the people surrounding him. He meets a suicidal Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter), but wants to distance himself from her. Life changing is his meeting with a soap salesman Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt), who is anarchy's poster child. Durden thrives on being a roguish rebel and convinces The Narrator into staging impromptu boxing matches in parking lots and deserted building basements. These matches are bare chested and with bare knuckles. The fighters beat the living crap out of each other until one yells stop. Durden is credited with starting fight clubs across the nation; and eventually turns the clubs into aggression laden pranksters releasing their malice on corporate America.Brutal violence and strong language is to be expected along with some pretty graphic images.

" Not as provocative as it thinks, but still a hit

For the most part, I wasn't disappointed, until the end.  Not the plot twist(when I read the novel, I thought it was a rip-off of a famous thriller, which I won't name, since it'll give away this one, but it plays much better in the movie.  Also, you have to admit Fincher et al played fair with the audience before pulling the twist), but Project Mayhem and so forth; that seemed out of control and unnecessary.  Still, this is almost nothing like you've seen before, and unlike many visually-oriented directors, Fincher puts his talents in service of telling an interesting story, so you're carried along.

" Honestly did not enjoy this movie at all......
",spoiler,"Fight Club is regarded as a fantastic movie and it is currently rated in the IMDb top ten. I guess this was supposed to be a movie for a specific generation, or for the people who were actively watching films in 1999. I still to this day do not understand what all the fuss is about? Yes this film is different from the traditional action and drama films but just because its different, it doesn't mean its good let alone fantastic or a work of art. Now this movie is supposed to be a representation, imagination or fragmentation Edward Norton's character the unnamed narrator and the movie in almost its entirety is his imagination including all the characters you see appear in the film including Brad Pitt. So basically this movie follows the ""It was all a dream"" concept where whatever you see is not real. I do not mind the idea if it is presented properly but this movie takes this concept to extremely ridiculous levels, where I have a hard time deciding if this film is supposed to be a drama film, an action film or fantasy.Fight Club has too many weird moments, unnecessary violence, Edward going bonkers and crippling and destroying another man during a fight for almost no reason at all. The film also has some disgusting scenes like the Fat guy with bigger chest than girls with implants that's disgusting, and made me want to turn off the film, not because there was a fat guy but I was disgusted how terrible this film portrays such people as if they are aliens. The plot is hardly a saving grace, it starts out promising, with people who are depressed are seeking help that could have been a good and interesting premise to base the film upon, but the more the plot progresses, the worse and the more ridiculous it gets. After the first 30 minutes this film was a torture to sit through. The ending was also nonsensical to me because I think the entire premise of this film is flawed from the start. The Narrator can't kill Tyler directly so he shoots himself so Tyler dies because Tyler was what Edward wanted to be. Whatever don't spend too much time thinking over that. The only saving grace is the acting of the lead actors Norton and Pitt. Edward Norton is really into the character at least he did the best he could with the script he was given to work with, despite all the ridiculous moments, Norton's good performance breathes some life into the movie. Brad Pitt also does a commendable job as Tyler although I did not like Tyler, I felt like Brad was at least trying. Never understood the love for this film, I have nothing against the people who like it I just don't understand where all the love comes from, in my personal opinion, Fight club is not a good film and is overrated.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Missed opportunity
",spoiler,"I've been reading the reviews on this film with interest during a lazy working afternoon, and feel compelled to add the conclusion I have drawn from them. Like many others I loved this movie when I first saw it (at the age of 21) but nine years down the line have grown tired of it, especially its philosophising which skim-reading just a handful of books reveals to be crass and unoriginal. I have been especially irritated and even worried by the people on here who hold this film up as some sort of manifesto for living; some even purport that the violence is realistic, a statement which anyone who has been in a real fight will find laughable.""Fight Club"" is certainly a very entertaining film, and I admire its controversial standpoint; however the thing that dooms it to being the province of immature young men is its ending. Now I've no grumble with the plot holes because after all it is a work of fiction, and its incoherence is part of its appeal. The problem lies in the fact that Tyler Durden is never really defeated. Sure, the Narrator ""kills"" Tyler by shooting himself, but he never repudiates him; even at the end he is this tongue-tied intellectual weakling. He could have destroyed Tyler's very ideology in a few well-chosen sentences about how his ""space monkeys"" have swapped one kind of mindless conformism for another, infinitely more dangerous one - and thus given both mature audiences and frustrated teenage boys a much more even-handed and intelligent discourse on the limits of freedom.Unfortunately this doesn't happen, and all we are left with is a well-acted, beautifully-shot movie that says absolutely nothing meaningful precisely because it is so one-sided that it becomes a piece of propaganda, and therefore worthless. An aside: another film I loved as a teenager and saw again recently was Fincher's ""Seven"". Same problem here too: seen through more mature eyes it just comes across as an empty and vulgar piece of pseudo-intellectualism by someone who doesn't really understand the concepts he is attempting to discuss because he hasn't read enough about them. I really hope I don't come across sounding superior because I'm not that widely-read either; however I am bright enough to recognise my limitations in this regard, and to understand the value of a balanced discourse versus a simple screed.Try Dante's unreachable ""Divine Comedy"" and Isiah Berlin's excellent essay ""Two Concepts Of Liberty"". These are the kind of pieces of work that you should be inviting to shape your perceptions of life, not some self-consciously proselytising Hollywood movie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Sorry, it bored me to tears. And then made me mad with bad storytelling.
",,"Beyond anything I'm about to say, I just don't understand how people can call Fight Club entertaining. I was so bored I had to give myself excuses to turn it off and do something else. It just kept going and going, and 90% of the screen time has nothing to do with anything. The humor was so juvenile and cliché, I can't say I laughed onceI heard the entire script back in 3rd grade at recess. So, really, as far as entertainment value goes, I can't see anything redeeming. Every 10 minutes I kept asking myself why I was even watching it, because nothing was happening, and in the end nothing did happen. There was no story, just some pretentious social commentary that was nothing new.Being a man, I've heard the cliché ""We're men raised by women!"" so many times I can't even take it seriously anymore. That cliché has existed since then 60's, as far as my knowledge, if not earlier than that. Now this takes that cliché and forms a movie around it. For one, everyone who is calling this ""daring"" or ""original"" needs to understand something: it takes no more balls the take a cliché and build a movie around it than it does to remake something.The intellectuals on there had argued both ways about the validity of ""We're men raised by women!"", so I'm not going to. Go read their reviews and find your open opinion on the matter. However, something no one here has said is that Fight Club is exactly that: an opinion. I could make a movie about a group of men who realize that they prefer being like women, then backlash and say EVERY man HAS to feel this way. Why? Because . . . well, because the fictional characters in the movie said so. That's because! Fight Club is an opinion, not an absolute truth. If you were to take real men and put them in a fight club such as this one, I can guarantee a lot of them would NOT feel alivebut the film is too immature to admit that it a possibility. Likewise, if you were to start a fight club for women, I can guarantee that a lot of them would feel just as alive as menonce again, the film doesn't admit that is a possibility. Fight Club is so self-absorbed in a shallow cliché that it denies all flaws it could have, and that is the main flaw with the social commentary. If Fight Club was truly ballsy and original itself, which it's not, the story would at least admit that it is an opinion and not absolute truth, as it claims. And, really, the fact alone that people would base their full opinions on something fictional is ridicules and shallow in itself. Fiction is fiction. Yes, fiction can be a tool to understanding reality, but it still can be manipulated to understand whatever reality it wants to understandincluding false reality. Basing an entire view on something based on something fictional, as this movie is, is just pathetic.Okay, now with that out of the way, I want to talk about the horrid storytelling this movie had. If Fight Club actually knew how to tell a story, I might have given it a much higher score. The entire movie is insanely boring, but the first hour and a half is pretty well-done, if you ignore the fact you've heard every bit of humor on the playground and that David Fincher has laughably poor arguing skills. After the car crash scene, however, the entire movie descends into poorly directed chaos. There are so many bloated, pointless scenes from this point until the end I was literally counting down the minutes until it was over. All the quirks that made the characters interesting fall away and leave them cardboard-thin. If the storytelling was done effectively, the chaos would have led into an intense, direct climax/finale. Instead, the ending is bloated with sub-plot after sub-plot that amount to nothing in the end, getting rid of any and all intensity that could have been created, and just leaving me bored and laughing at things that weren't supposed to be funny. The decent fight club plot twists into a cheesy wannabe Die Hard plot and at that point I lost all ability to take the movie seriously. I can understand it was trying to add another layer to the overdone social commentary, but it didn't work. The ending should have been cut by at least 40 minutes to be even close to effective. Poor, cheesy storytelling.In the end, I can understand why people would think this movie is brilliant. On the other hand, I can't understand anyone out of junior high who shouldn't see the gaping flaws in the social commentary. But maybe I'm looking at this entire review the wrong way. Maybe I'm trying to find flaws with the story, when it had no story to start with. This just a poor excuse to preach clichés you've heard all your life, not to entertain. It's an English opinion paper, nothing more, nothing less. If so, it gets an F for being pretensions, close-minded, and just downright boring.5/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ridiculous
",spoiler,"This might be the stoopidest movie ever made. The story is ridiculous, the twist beyond retarded.Spoiler ALERTOooh Brad Pitt IS Ed Norton. Is this supposed to be deep?Given what passes as intellectualism and political discourse in this country, it is no wonder that this film is heralded as a masterpiece. I give major props to Fincher for imbuing this piece of idiocy with great style. The lighting and clothes are top -notch. But that does not make for a good movie. I'm sure to teenage bozos, this is about something. To anyone with a brain it is pure dreck.Is that supposed to be funny? Is it supposed to be insightful? What it leaves one with, is a feeling that Brad Pitt sure wishes he was cooler than he is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Boring as hell
",spoiler,"This has got to be one of the most overrated movies of all-time.Oooh, it was all in his mind. How original. No one has ever thought of that before.Obviously I am being sarcastic.This movie was so boring that I could only get about halfway through it before having to stop, and only later did I get around to watching the second half. That was a mistake. It was as utterly pointless and uninteresting in the second half as it was in the first.This is a classic example of a movie being popular simply because it was trendy for people to say that they liked it.And Brad Pitt? Give me a break. The guy is a hack, only a star because of his looks. He simply can't act.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The twist ruined it
",spoiler,"Starts off slow, eases into Jack's addiction to support groups, then progresses to meeting Tyler Durden for the first time. They start scrapping in a parking lot regularly because they're bored, attracting the attention of other men who want to fight. A secret society of bare knuckle fighters is formed as a result.Up to this point, I thought the movie was interesting. Jack is a man trying to fill the void in his boring life and realises he's not alone when his fight nights become wildly popular with other men trying to find excitement in their equally hum drum lives.The twist that Jack IS Tyler Durden was almost as bad as revealing it was all a dream. It would have been better keeping Tyler as a REAL man so we could watch how their philosophies clash without the stupid exaggerated conclusion. I'm all for the adsurd and suspending disbelief but watching huge buildings blow up because a man went crazy and turned his underground fighting into a terrorist organisation was ridiculous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Incredibly overrated and makes little sense
",spoiler,"I'm as confused as a rat in a maze as to why Fight Club is rated so highly and is in the top 10. The story and the overall film doesn't make much sense, I mean how on Earth does an insomniac office worker have a split personality believing he's talking (and fighting) to someone and starts up a cult following of men that not only do they all appear to enjoy fighting without moral question but are completely brainwashed and have become terrorists to his cause? Not only that but the main character breaks the fourth wall. I just find this film to be incredibly weird, also I don't understand why Marla just can't give a straight answer of things that are happening between them which the main character doesn't realise he's doing. But the weirdest thing about this film is when he's fighting with Tyler Durden, there's a part where he's being dragged and it's seen from a security camera which shows it's just him dragging himself, but how is this possible? He looks like he's being dragged by a ghost.Personally, I didn't like this film and from what I think from a general consensus, no way is this a masterpiece, maybe the revealing of the split personality thing but everything else is just weird.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The anti-anti-corporate film
",spoiler,"Fight Club (1999) is considered a cult classic by those who praise it for its brutal critique of the meaninglessness of modern urban life. It is condemned as ""irresponsible"" by some critics who claim that it advocates violence. I claim that both of these positions reveal a total lack of insight into what the film is actually saying, and an unwillingness or inability to read the text of the film as a whole.It seems that all criticism of the film focuses only on the first half. The first half depicts a man living a consumerist lifestyle in an anonymous American city who meets a powerful man who inspires him to make radical changes in his life, primarily through all-male meetings of consensual bloody violence called Fight Clubs. The debate about whether violence is a legitimate response to a suffocating culture of submission is a legitimate one, but not one that will ever be meaningfully discussed in mainstream media. State institutions have a monopoly on violence. End of debate.The film is stylishly designed, charmingly performed and its philosophy is quotable, the only problem is the second half, in which Fight Club becomes Project Mayhem. The second half appears to be nonsensical but a rather cynical message can be drawn from it. Whether the destruction of credit card companies to erase personal debt without loss of human life is a legitimate response to capitalism is not a debate the film encourages. These men are not depicted as free-thinking radicals liberated from wage slavery, but as a mindless army blindly following the orders of their deified leader.Maybe the anarchists, activists and eccentrics are feeling validated by Twentieth Century Fox for offering them entertainment that presses the alienated buttons they have been sullenly nurturing and so resist a critical examination of their beloved product. The revelation that the two main characters are actually the same person is merely dismissed as bad plotting, but is much more self-aware and manipulative.There is a tiny clue to the true ""twist"" in the film. There is a comment in the narration that we hear but do not understand, and so forget. This is an effective method of subliminal messaging that is demonstrated in the film by Brad Pitt's character inserting single frames of pornography into children's films. ""It's called a change-over. The movie goes on and nobody has any idea."" Everyone knows that different genres are designed to induce different feelings in an audience; horror movies scare, comedies make you laugh and thrillers thrill. Fight Club starts off as social commentary, designed to make you think, and moves into thriller, designed to cease thought by getting you excited. Most thrillers have completely inane utilitarian plots. I worry about thrillers that have actually raised serious and complex issues.The hero of the film, who has spouted all this quotable philosophy, is completely insane. It seems the story so far has been an episode of acute dissociative schizophrenia and if you are on the protagonist's side you will stay on his side as he wakes up from this episode, realises that he is Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, and attempts to stop the progress of the destruction he has instigated – blowing up the credit card companies – because it is obviously wrong.The film successfully negates everything of interest that has been presented, and does it all in the mindless thriller genre, so the cult followers of the film can remain willfully ignorant to how they have been manipulated.When the protagonist realises that he is unable to stop the destruction of the credit card companies, he decides to kill himself. He shoots himself in the mouth, both killing himself (Brad Pitt) and not killing himself (Edward Norton). He has thus liberated himself from the man who liberated him and so is now free to watch the destruction of the buildings he tried to save.For the first half of the film we are Edward Norton and our minds and lives are opened up by Brad Pitt. The second half of the film then reveals that Brad Pitt is a lunatic who must be stopped and that actually he is a part of us, he is an aspect of ourselves that we must destroy. We enjoy the destruction vicariously through this film, we buy the DVD and maybe even the t-shirt. Our inner anarchist is stimulated, excited and finally subdued; put back to sleep for another decade of employment, consumption and the thought-provoking philosophy of Hollywood studios.http://www.personaproductions.com/2014/10/fight-club.html",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" It's not a changeover, it's a deus ex machina that's spelled R-E-F-U-N-D
",spoiler,"After all the discrete, awful, painful, sequences with too much blood and gore, and real buzz-kill sheet scenes where Brad Pitt, wearing boxing gloves, or surgical gloves, humping the washed-up chain-smoker. I thought there must be something more than a deus ex machina in the end, something thrilling and enlightening that somehow makes the movie worthy of the suffering.But no. Brace yourself for the catastrophic collapses near the end, it's basically the routine deus ex machina that explains everything by startling the protagonist out of reverie, things went awry when the narrator and Brad Pitt merged into one, a most implausible schizophrenic, who contradicts almost the whole plot line before this ham-fisted twist. Then this eerie double personality talked directly to the audience from David Fincher's perspective -- now it's a holy trinity of them -- ""It's called a changeover, the movie goes on and nobody in the audience has any idea.""I'd have hurled myself at the screen if I had been old enough to go and see and understand it in a cinema.Besides, I have little idea what the novel by Chuck Palahniuk is about, I tried to give it a whirl but it kinda strengthened my belief that stream of consciousness should be solidified before written down, the ill-punctuated text rendered me brain damaged.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Film that you hate to love
",,"I still think that I shouldn't like this film. That I shouldn't allow myself to like this film. Its worldview is so ugly, so nihilistic and corrupted, that you actually fear that your own morals darken just by looking at it. Sure you justify it to yourself by telling that it's actually telling us not to give into hate, not to believe that our lives have no meaning, not to realize that we're just corporate puppets. And yes, the film actually carries a warning undertone, showing why people like Tyler Durden cannot be correct.It's hard to tell yourself that when you're watching the actual film though. Because in all honesty Brad Pitt is so good in this film, so magnificently charismatic, that it's no wonder that some people actually went and started their own fight clubs. No wonder that Tyler Durden has been voted the best movie character of all time numerous times. The man is that good in his role. And it is a distinct possibility that our society would be better off if he weren't, because in all honesty Tyler Durden is everything that we shouldn't be.And that's what makes this film so damn good. It is the ugly underbelly of human condition, of modern society. It's not nice to look at, it won't make you feel any better, but damn if isn't one heck of a trip to experience. This movie is so convinced that what it's saying is the God's truth that you have no choice but to be pulled in, even momentarily.But it's not just the message. It's a great movie even without the story and the character of Tyler Durden. The style, the art direction, the camera work, the rest of the cast, the music, the dirty jokes, the plot twists, the sheer ugly charisma. You might never like this film, no matter how often you can force yourself to watch it, but you can never deny that it's not a brilliant piece of film making. And that is why I think everyone should see it at least once. Because it's the end of the spectrum, as of now. You'll appreciate life more after you've realized that this is a work of fiction and that you're not living in it yourself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Undoubtedly..... one of the best mystery thrillers i have EVER seen !!!!
",,"Fight club... the most intelligent work of the director David Fincher till date. The main cast include Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter... all well suited to their roles.After watching the American History X (1998) i understood that Edward Norton is an actor who can handle any sort of role exceptionally well. he proved the same here as well. But the one who completely surprised me in Fight Club was Brad Pitt. His character was so cleverly plotted that it bears the entire base of the movie over its shoulders. i doesn't want to go much deeper into this character otherwise it will ruin the entire excitement of the viewer.There are only two mystery thrillers that i personally believe can compete with Fight Club. One is the Usual Suspects (1995) and the second is Reservoir Dogs(1992).If you haven't watched this film till date then don't wait further and watch this film now. I strongly recommend Fight Club to you. exceptional film.... 10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Rule number one about Fight Club; you do not talk about Fight Club. Rule number two about Fight Club: you do not talk about Fight Club!
",,"1999 was a great year for film, with many great films releases that year: The Matrix, American Beauty, Being John Malkovich, Toy Story 2, The Sixth Sense are just a few examples. To join them was Fight Club, a controversial film based on a popular novel and directed by David Fincher, a man whom career was on the up.Edward Norton play an insurance clerk who was suffering from insomnia and struggles to deal with it. He starts by attending support groups for people suffering from long term illnesses to cope with his issues. Yet that disappears when Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) starts to attend these meeting and takes away their edge. Whilst on a business trip the man meets Travis Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap maker and salesman. They quickly becomes friends and move in together into a dilapidated house. They also start to take joy when having fights and the popularity of these fights quickly expand into Fight Club. But under Travis' leadership Fight Club soon takes an even darker turn and it's up to the man to stop him and his plot.Fincher is a very skilled director and with Fight Club he gives audiences his most stylist film. He uses a lot of visual trick and starts to play around a lot more with the camera. He shows confidence with CGI and the nature of how it was used was fitting for the film. There is a dark style and tone throughout, Fincher does not hold back the violence or some of the more grim aspects of the film. There is a lot of dark humour in the film, particularly during the early part of the film. Fincher with a screenplay by Jim Uhls which is based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk tell a very complex story and there is a lot of themes throughout. There are themes about people trying to find their identity, how the human mind works, criticisms of modern advertising and consumerism and how people could use it or become hypocrites, how a cult would function and of course, man's desire for violence and destruction. Despite it's title this film does not focus to much on the underground fighting. This is an intelligent film which will allow the audience to think.There is some excellent acting in this film with a great cast. Pitt and Norton were brilliant in the lead roles, with Pitt having a potent charisma throughout whilst Norton is effective as an everyman character of the piece. Bonham Carter was also great in this film and these 3 actors were a dream team together.An excellent film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" A satire,with dark provocative comedy.
",,"In the summer of 2000, when I had absolutely nothing to do, Helena, my neighbor knocked on my door. When I opened the door she excitedly asked me if I had seen the movie Fight Club yet. At that time I was sure that I had never heard of it, but I became interested after seeing her be so enthusiastic about it. So I went next door and watched it with her. Since then, this film has become one of my all time favorites. Tyler Durden's character is insanely likable, because he is full of enlightened information. He is obviously a sociopath making him seem terrifying, witty, funny and brilliant. He is not a one sided character as some would think from the title of the film. Tyler makes you question some, if not all, of your conservative beliefs. I've actually found myself quoting some of the things Tyler has said, years after I've seen the film. Tyler believes the world has turned into nothing more that a commercialized way of life. Some of the things he does will blow your mind and will definitely make you a little squeamish. Unlike many of us, Tyler wants to hit rock bottom, because he believes, ""It is only when you have lost everything that you are free to do anything."" His dreams are for the world to go back to a more primal state. His outlook on human life itself may be somewhat disturbing, but it makes you stop and say to yourself, ""Wow, that makes sense."" The cast of Fight Club is superb, and Brad Pitt's performance as Tyler Durden is incredible. He makes you believe that Tyler is a part of his personality. Even Brad's twisted laugh through out the film makes you believe he has a loose screw. Also, I could not help to hang on every word that Edward Norton said through his narration. His acting ability many would say is always worth seeing. In the beginning of the movie his character is an insomnia-tic zombie living the mundane corporate life. He transitions his character right up to the end when you can see that he is a changed man. Marla's character is someone that really doesn't care what anyone thinks about her. Her philosophy of life is that is she might die at any moment, and the tragedy was that she didn't. Helena Bonham Carter is a perfect fit for her part, her statements make you want to laugh, but also make you feel a little uncomfortable. Some of the scenes are ad lib-bed and Helen definitely contributed to some of the taboo aspects of the film. The time line for this film is done in a way that jumps along through different parts of the story, but is so fluent that even the most average movie watcher will know what's going on. This film also has everything a seasoned movie watcher comes to see. The imagery and the cinematography are done flawlessly, the witty irony will make you laugh out load, and the dark and grimy scenes go hand in hand with the dark comedy.. Just remember that this is a satirical work and once you get to the mouth dropping explosive surprise ending. It cohesively brings the whole film into perspective. I believe that this film should be watched more than once, simply because you will be able to see the imagination and effort behind every scene. To me I honestly think that this is one of the most incredible films I have ever seen. My opinion of this film is that it is a dark and honest poem that speaks directly to my male generation, and I urge you to give it a chance so that you may witness the genius behind it too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" My point of view
",,"People often tell me that I am too picky when it comes to movies. There's only 4 or 5 movies with 10 stars or excellent rating on my list (and believe me, I've seen them quite a lot). And for me, Fight club is best film ever made. And I don't think any other will surpass it. For me, this is definitely not an action movie, nor a thriller. This is psychological comedy. Yes, it is violent. Yes, there's lot of fights and blood, too much for my taste, but I take them, so as final twist, as (and only as) a metaphor. Excellent casting, superb acting, brilliant direction. Very thought provoking. I feel the urge to watch it every year or two. But it's just me:-)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Against the system, it grabs your intention from the beginning. You wont expect what the story brings you until you reach the end. I really hope to watch something like this again. This story deserved an Oscar for the storyline. The actors have done a good job especially three main characters, Norton, Pitt and Carter. I rate this movie 10 over 10.

" Fantastic, from start to finish...
",,"This is by far my favorite film of all time. I was very hesitant to watch this film at first, but now cannot imagine having never seen it. It has absolutely raised the bar, and so far no other film I have seen has met that standard yet.Anyone who says this is a 'guy movie' is absolutely wrong. It is truly unique, and in my opinion an important and almost life changing film. It has definitely changed my view of the world a bit. It's a must see film, and my advice for anyone hesitant to watch is to ignore the title and cover and just dive right in. It will far surpass your expectations. It certainly surpassed mine. I would also recommend watching it more than one time. I can't even count how many times I have watched this film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A fine, and often misunderstood film
",spoiler,"If you haven't seen it, and don't know others who have seen it, you probably think this is a movie that glorifies violence. And you'd be wrong. The movie is certainly charged with testosterone, but it is actually a deep, thought provoking movie examining the rampant consumerism of society versus ideas of nihilism and primitivism.The central figure to all the philosophizing is Tyler Durden, played to perfection by Brad Pitt. Durden is perhaps one of the most charismatic villains since Richard III, with eminently quotable sound bites that speak to the disillusionment in all of us. Pair that off with Ed Norton as a sardonic narrator, at first a wreck lost to the 'IKEA nesting instinct' and rendered cynical by the amorality of his job, and we have a scathing indictment of the consumerism smothering society.The bloody underground boxing of the Fight Club is a way the characters can gain control of their life, break free of the bonds society shackles them with. This in turn becomes Project Mayhem a terrorist organization aiming to send society 'back to zero.' In one chilling scene, Tyler evokes his dream world from the shadows: a world of post-apocalyptic proportions where people worry about things that matter--i.e. survival. Clearly, the violence has escalated beyond the point where it makes sense, but at the same time we can't shake the truth beyond Tyler's words, the desire to live one's own life.The film doesn't tell you 'do this' or 'do that.' It just asks you to think.(Some may be put off by a few plot holes the twist creates. These are actually fewer than they first appear, and further, the film is not the poster child for realism. Just ride with it.)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Essential Viewing
",spoiler,"There's a certain poetic nobility in Fight Club's disappointing box-office performance. After all, here's a movie that attacks product, profit and the capitalist doctrine and fails to be consumed - not what anyone intended but would it really do for the people involved to make an enormous windfall on the back of its release? It hardly matters anyway because anyone involved in Fight Club must have known that they'd made something so good that it would be adequate reward just to be associated with it. It's a seminal piece of work - a perfect conflation of visual and conceptual imagination that's as deceptive as one of Tyler's bars of soap. You may have thought you were going to see a movie about men beating each other up and the delicious truth is that that's just what many Americans DID think only to be confronted by a film that challenged the most basic assumptions upon which the western world functions - namely that unrestrained, free market commercial enterprise increases wealth and subsequently the quality of life. But Planet Starbucks isn't a paradise, it's nothingness and here's a film that says so more directly than most. Ed Norton's narrator is the emptiness at the heart of the system, emasculated by modernism, numbed by consumption - his life is a corporate by-product and the need to feel some kind of quantifiable human emotion creates Tyler Durden, an unrestrained force for personal liberation. Tyler's destructive counter-cultural revolution is an unflinching satirical knife to the throat of the thinking that blunts so many of us and it's astonishing to see this level of angry denunciation in a mainstream Hollywood movie. Fincher's movie is punk rock film-making, indifferent to the generic considerations that shape most American cinema and one which forces you to think about yourself and the forces that control your life. Freedom is an illusion Tyler shows us and Fincher reinforces this notion by drawing attention to the medium's illusionary potential in a series of virtuoso sequences which shatter that so-called forth wall just as the characters try and break free from the all-consuming commercial blandification of the modern world. A great film the first time you see it, a different film the second time and even better - Fight Club is a perfectly composed reaction to the modern age and its false promises. This movie really does have something important to say, whether you're ready to hear it or not is a different matter.

Now, that is not a smart thing to say when criticising  a film but there is no way to avoid it. Fight Club is extremely violent. This is something I do not like in general but for a movie with a title like Fight Club to be expected. And it is not senseless violence like in Matrix but belonging to the story. Indeed it is the essence and in this sense acceptable. What is wrong, if not evil, is that it is presented as a possible solution to the emptiness we feel in our lives. So our generation did not enjoy the blessing of an honest good war? No wonder we degenerate and start buying IKEA furniture. Is this a joke? It is not meant as one.
Our hero (the `Narrator') cannot sleep. He is not really happy but who is. What to do? First he finds some unusual hobby. He goes to meetings of people who really suffer.  And the mixture of real feelings mixed with the ridiculous situation gives him energy some fake `sense of life'. There he meets the beautiful Marla. My heart jumped with joy. There was some kindred spirit. They should fall in love, marry, settle down, have some kids live happily (more or less) ever after. That is what I want (I know I am the one who is sick but this is what watching classic Hollywood movies did to me.) It would have been perfect. Unfortunately the film would have been over after fifteen minutes. That is why our hero first has to go to point zero. And he does it by establishing this Fight Club and moving in with lovely Brad. Okay, why not. But does it have to be terror organisation next? Come on. What is the point of the whole thing? You enjoyed the film? Punch yourself on the nose and start thinking. Or even better stop pretending that you do. The schizophrenia angle was rather foreseeable but the happy ending was okay. Like I said... the two hours in between where at best annoying at worst...

" Gritty and Surreal
",,"One of the best films to come out this year. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt have been excellently cast in to this film, bringing the whole atmosphere and story to life. Some people say it is a violent film, and it is, but without condoning such violence. It can be graphic at times yet this is not what makes the film ticks. It is a combination of many things, from the characters, the dark humour and the main story of the film.Shame that in Hong Kong, the marketing for the film wasn't as big as it should be. Another one lost to the shallow culture of Hong Kong.

" Fight Club (1999) * out of ****
",,"Fight Club could have been a great film with the amazing plot idea, but it falls very short of what it could have been. What redeems this movie from complete BOMB-dom is the acting and the seldom black comedy. The movie has poor to O.K. directing.

" Fincher's weakest work
",spoiler,"""Fight Club"" is one of those movies where you need to watch it more than once to fully understand what happened in the movie. The problem is that ""Fight Club"" leaves you with no reason to re-watch it other than to know if the movie is actually a complex but brilliant masterpiece, or an overrated film that just barely rises above mediocrity. I guess I will have to stay with believing the latter because nothing makes me want to return.The narrator (Edward Norton), who is suffering from insomnia, meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a company trip. When the narrator returns to his apartment, he finds that it has been destroyed and, with no one else to go to, calls Tyler. The narrator moves into Tyler's house and one night, upon Tyler's request, the narrator punches him. The two begin to fight and attract a crowd of people, which becomes Fight Club. ""Fight Club"" is hailed as a brilliant social commentary about consumerism and how we as people live our lives now, though it isn't saying anything more than any other person or form of media that has spoken up about consumerism, and at the same time is feeding the viewer a false idea. Tyler says, ""An entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy sh*t we don't need."" Right, because there are no other reasons why people would be working these jobs that they hate? Not everything is about consumerism. Some people have jobs for that reason, but others have certain situations in their lives which makes them have to take these white collar jobs even if they hate it. In all fairness, the movie does save itself a bit by disapproving of Tyler's radical plans, but it is still trying to pass off his ideas as an important message when his they are flawed.Carrying on the theme of trying to be brilliant but failing, let's take a look at the plot. So, Tyler is just a figment of the Narrator's imagination because of his insomnia. Okay, got it. So, the Narrator is fighting himself in the parking lot of the bar when a group of guys comes out to watch and decides that they want to fight as well, which means that they were the first people to join fight club. But, they saw that there was obviously something wrong with the Narrator because he's fighting himself, so why would they end up following a guy who was obviously not all there? He wasn't spreading his propaganda about consumerism at the time either, so they weren't following him because they believed his ideas. Then, the twist that Tyler was in the Narrator's head the whole time is one of the laziest twists in cinematic history. Ignoring the fact that it barely makes sense like with the example I gave above, the twist of something being in a character's mind is like a film student level idea when they're trying to be deep. Then, to get rid of Tyler, the Narrator shoots himself in the head and that somehow kills him. I've heard that it's supposed to symbolize that the Narrator was finally able to let go of Tyler and is able to make his own choice now, but to me, symbolism only works if it makes sense. What it's symbolizing makes sense, how it's done doesn't.Along with Pitt and Norton, Helena Bonham Carter (Marla) also appears in the film, who is used for nothing more than additional pointless drama, that makes no sense in the grand scheme of things. It is said throughout the whole movie that the Narrator doesn't like Marla, but the side of him that's Tyler at least tolerates her or has romantic feelings towards her or something. So, at the end, when Project Mayhem is about to go through with its master plan, the Narrator warns Marla to leave town and when she's captured, he goes to help her. Now, it makes a little sense that he might feel guilty about getting her involved, even though he was willing to let her die earlier in the film, but then it implies some sort of deeper connection between them, even though it was the Tyler side of the Narrator that liked her, and it's shown that the Narrator and Tyler both have different ideas and thoughts, so they are individuals, but now the Narrator suddenly cares about Marla.""Fight Club"" is a movie with a flawed understanding of society that, while it's condemning the actions of Tyler Durden, it is promoting his flawed logic as some sort of important message about society and how we live our lives. This movie comes off to me one of those films that actually has very little or nothing new to say, but people believe it has an important commentary to it and praise it even though it's nothing more or less than mediocre and barely worth remembering. I like David Fincher a lot and while, based on what I've seen, I don't believe he's made a bad movie yet, this is cutting is pretty close.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Simply The Worst Film Of All Time
",,"Chuck Pallanick is a real piece of worst writing ever existing on this planet. This is one fact, admit it. The Fight Club flick is a real decent screening of his terribly writing on to a silver screen. This is The worst film of all time in all instances, in all possible scenarios. Point. No arguing here. Nothing, simply nothing in this unimaginable horrific piece of manure gives any redeeming feature or any clue. Dirt, mud, muck, slime, blood, vapid acting, hollowness, emptiness, nihilism and a total waste of 120 minutes. Just. Terrible. It is so. Edward Norton gives a weak delivery, Brad Pitt does not help, too, and Helena Bonham Carter is simply awful. This is the key-word - awful. The whole Fincher's flick is just awful mess.

" Half baked
",spoiler,"Like so many other users I found this a worthwhile movie to watch for about the first third. The film deals out some hard blows against modern consumer society, that could be called daring for a high budget Hollywood production. The given thesis- relief and the chance to achieve self-discovery through violence, is inane though. As the story develops we see that the whole Fight Club thing leads the protagonists to become some sort of a terrorist organization, culminating in a series of attacks that obviously destroy a good part of the town in the end. Isn't that turning the whole point upside down, so that the message could be: Non conformity will inevitably lead to chaos and destruction, so please avoid any critical thoughts ? In a way I felt that in the end the script-writer attempts to apologizes for the hard strokes dispersed in the beginning.The most embarrassing thing about the movie of course is the displaying of Norton's schizophrenia. You can watch this movie as often as you want: This trick will never work and it will always be an insult to the intelligence of the viewer to realize that the makers really believe they can come up with such nonsense and earnestly hope to get away with it (which they actually did,of course. After all this half-baked botch ranks in the top 30 of all times. That's as incredible as Norton and Pit being the same person ).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Entertaining, But Nothing Special.
",,"FIGHT CLUB stars Brad Pitt and Edward Norton as two men who form an underground club where people fight, and the hype catches on with people around the country.  This is an entertaining movie with good leads and acceptable fight scenes, but it's barely passable at best.  The plot is unbelievably dumb, there are a few plot holes and the story fails to make sense at some points.  Pitt and Norton carry the film, but the other characters are one-dimensional and have little or no interest.  The movie is well worth a watch, but it's still a disappointment.2 out of 5",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Preposterous and Imbecilic
",,"Okay, so the acting and the overall production was top-drawer, but absolutely nothing can overcome one of the most ridiculous storylines I have ever come across. I put this movie in the same category as David Cronenberg's ""Crash"", in that they both are obsessed with concepts so contrary to basic human nature, that they are totally inane and unbelievable. In ""Crash"", it is absurd to think there are really people who are sexually turned-on by bad car crashes; in ""Fight Club"", it is ridiculous to believe that there are people who enjoy getting pumelled. Thoughts of such concepts leave me so cold as to take away any possibility of enjoying the film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Sorry, I don't buy it. (spoiler, maybe)
",spoiler,"This movie makes the occasional gesture towards Nietszche and being a fight between Reason and the Id - this becomes most apparent closer to the end, when we learn a little something about our main characters. Mostly, however, it is about grown men beating each other into gumbo, because the actual meat of the movie barely touches on that. Essentially, it is a little bit of philosophy wrapped up in a lot of very, very bloody boxing. There's something suspect about the whole matter.It's a rush, sure, but if they wanted to film a WCW match, why did they feel the need to wrap some half-baked quasi-New Age ideas around it? I fear that a bunch of guys around the country will miss the spirit-vs-flesh angle and decide that this fighting thing is Way Cool, Man, and will set up little Fight Clubs in their basements until they all die from internal hemorrhaging. I guess people will buy anything if you wrap fake spirituality around it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I really think this movie had the same problems that Fincher's last movie (The Game) had.... It lands a huge surprise on you and then forces you to believe it even though it doesn't work at all with the movie. In ""The Game"" it didn't bother me as much because that was more of a ""fun"" film, where as Fight Club actually proports to say something about society. It's worth seeing, but just the ""The Emporer's New Clothes"", this movie proports to be so much, but is really nothing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ONE OF THE ALL-TIME GREATS.
",,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠Fight Club is one of those movies that is so unique and really shows how much movies have evolved since classics such as Double Indemnity or Vertigo or The Third Man. This movie is psychological testosterone. There's so much depth in the dialogues such as 'This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time' or 'We're the middle children of history man' or 'You're the all-singing, all-dancing crap of the world' and my favourite 'How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?'I would go as far as to say that this is an important film. There is so much the film asks of the viewer. This is thought-provoking cinema at its finest.I have seen Fight Club several times and I simply love it from start to finish.It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" i didn't manage to emphatize or suspend my disbelief on this flawed movie
",,"the movie started very well, in a very original way, but the very moment the girl made her entrance into the movie, I understood that I fell into a trap: her appearance as a mix of Patsy Kensit and Beetlejuice, which should represent some sort of troubled woman - troubled by an unclear kind of trouble she seems to have - is where the movie immediately starts to turn into a boring repetition of a ""look, this man was living a senseless life and will find his real nature by beating the hell out of people"".in general, the whole movie seems to travel on a path between ""troubled people are cool"" and ""oh, look at the poor middle class worker turning into a cool beating machine"".then, a couple of stupid plot twists, and some hundreds of scenes which require an abundant dose of suspension of disbelief, turn the movie into what seems to be the movie reduction of some comics for troubled teenagers (and pardon my ignorance if it actually is, but I'm not and never been into such kind of comics).I'm 39, and I have watched the movie on year 2016, so I have probably missed the right time to watch it on target (I believe the target is about 30 years old), but I don't really think I could have personally enjoyed the movie at any age.i understand the movie is trying to tell you something beyond what you actually see: yes, I have the minimum IQ required to understand this (which is about 60, I believe); it's just that the ""wake up and make your dreams real"" motto which is behind the movie just doesn't catch me, especially if it is told for 130 minutes *AND* in a stupid way.yes, this movie seems to fascinate lots of people, while harassing a strict minority; I'm clearly part of the second area. I'm not giving 1/10 to this movie like many others, as it would be unfair, but honestly I can't give it more than 4.my hint is: if when you see the girl coming into the screen your bad-movie-sense tickles you, then do yourself a favour and turn the thing off",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" What a beautiful story!
",spoiler,"Be forewarned. This is a film chest-deep in violence. It begins with a man pointing a gun into another's mouth, and it ends with the bombing of a skyline of urban office buildings. In between, you'll see a lot of young men bashing in each other's faces as blood freely flows all over the place.Americans are used to covering up the nation's defects as much as possible. When some unfortunate tendency surfaces with tragic results, as in the school shootings, we look to teams of experts interviewed on the media to explain the problem and suggest how we might remedy it. Fight Club spits in the face of all such grand projects of self-improvement and national justification. This fast- paced, clever, and visually stunning drama reveals the shadow side of America — one that is impervious to moral bromides and easy answers.The screenplay by Jim Uhls, based on a novel by Chuck Palahniuk, is chock full of witty and cynical takes on self-examination, the New Age, Martha Stewart, mail order catalogs, law and order, and sexual politics. Here corporate culture and consumerism are identified as the excesses that give rise to the darker side of the American personality.The narrator of this mesmerizing film is played with spooky intensity by Edward Norton. He has an odious job as a recall coordinator for a major automobile company. When he tries to get some relief for his insomnia, his doctor suggests that to really feel pain, he should attend a group for victims of testicular cancer. The narrator soon becomes addicted to a variety of support groups. For the first time in his life, he gets in touch with his emotions and cries freely. However, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), another tourist in the land of genuine suffering, spoils this therapeutic release for him by holding up a mirror to his dishonesty.The narrator's life is radically changed when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a very mysterious fellow who is a philosophical nihilist. His various jobs comprise a concerted attack on corporate America. Durden makes soap out of human fat retrieved from liposuction clinics and sells it to posh department stores; the enterprise is actually a cover for making nitroglycerin for bombs. While moonlighting as a projectionist, he splices momentary pornographic images into family films. Working as a waiter, he urinates into the soup of unsuspecting customers. He lives in a boarded-up abandoned house on the outskirts of town, a place where nobody would think to look for anybody. The narrator moves in with him.Before long these two alienated young men have found a new outlet for their pent-up anger-all-out bare knuckle fist fighting. They establish Fight Club, after-hours gatherings of men who share their pleasure in masochistic pain. The secret movement spreads until there are clubs all over the country. These then evolve into guerrilla war units in a project Durden calls ""Mayhem."" Through various acts of violence and vandalism, their goal is the downfall of corporate America. Because business-as-usual only benefits the rich and the powerful, these frustrated and unfulfilled men are determined to level the playing field-literally. Their devil-may- care love of violence is more evidence of the shadow in America.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Quickie Review: Fight Club
",spoiler,"Fight Club is like Shrek. And Shrek is like onions. And onions have layers. Therefore; Fight Club has layers. Many of them. Because of this I do feel it's a movie that needs repeat viewing in order to appreciate it more. Fight Club makes interesting and very relatable statements against the current consumer-driven materialistic society (which has only gotten worse since the film's release.) Very stylish and sophisticated, the film features some hilarious and inventive ways of breaking the fourth wall and hitting you with subliminal messages. The famous twist ending remains one of the wackiest in recent memory and performances across the part are perfect. It's one of those movies where you notice something new about it each time you see it, whether it be a split second shot of a dong or a single line of dialogue that makes you ponder on the emptiness of your existence. The cinematography is outstanding and really adds to the nihilistic tone of the movie. Overall, the film is about a great many things: manliness, materialism, generation X and Y's place in the world, life's little ironies, the oddity of western civilisation and, of course, fighting. But we can't talk about that.Best Scene: Hmmm, picking one is difficult because I felt that the film flowed in such a way that it didn't feel like a movie where one scene follows another and instead worked as a whole. I'll pick the part where Edward Norton beats the crap out of himself and blames his boss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Top 5 movies of all time.

For those who have read the novels, I can say this one of those brilliant adaptations which are made into a better movie than novel. The thing which irritates me is this movie is always remembered for its absolutely mind blowing ending, but though the ending was fantastic, the character Tyler Durden and his ideology was even more spectacular. Combine that with the most intelligent narration and brilliant star-cast, you have recipe for making the greatest movie of all time.

As soon as I started the movie, it was honestly just weird, hard to understand, and random. As the movie came to and end, I was netural with the feeling about this film. Some things were good, some were bad. Now Tyler Durden, that was the best thing about this movie. He was a guy that many people are envious of. Laid back, cool, exciting. Brad Pitt played the part perfectly. But just the whole story line was, in my opinion, not that exciting. Don't get me wrong, there were some awesome parts, but there were some bad parts as well. I'm not at all saying this movie was bad, but I felt let down or disappointed after hearing all the rant and rave about how great of a movie it was. So overall, I view the movie as exceptional acting and awesome characters, but not so good of a story line.

" Edward Norton finds his life a compete loss until he meet Tyler, the soap salesman
",spoiler,"Fight Club is a rather dark drama filled with subtle comedy and with a rather dark ending. The ending is actually the most important scene in the movie and the director decided to begin the film with it too. However, he purposely leaves out the major twist you learn at the end. This is obviously done not to ruin the rest of the movie. However, the fact that you never learn the narrator's real name the entire movie is the most important part of this plot twist. When you learn that Tyler is actually just the narrator's mental projection, your entire understanding of the movie is changed. Tyler is the narrator's mental projection of what he wants to be. During the movie, the narrator's physical appearance worsens while Tyler's actually gets better. This was a consciously made decision by the director in the film. ""We decided early on that I would start to starve myself as the film went on, while he would lift and go to tanning beds; he would become more and more idealized as I wasted away."" The fact that the narrator's physical appearance degrades over the lapse of the film is an excellent choice to show how actually his mental state became worse and worse. This is not only because of his continuous insomnia throughout the film, but also for his own self-hatred for how average his life has become. This is why he eventually creates Tyler as an image of a true man and what he actually wants to be. What he wants to see in himself he envisions in Tyler.Tyler is very masculine, handsome, and confident. All of these characteristics the narrator lacks. Tyler is what the narrator actually sees himself as becoming. He falsely sees partaking in these underground fight clubs to make himself more masculine. This is why Tyler's appearance becomes more ideal, while the narrator's worsens. He only sees himself become this more ideal person while in reality; he is not bettering himself at all. He quits his job, loses all connections to his friends and family, and completely loses track of who he actually is. The reason why the narrator creates Tyler is not only because of his hatred for his own lifestyle, but also how emasculate he felt in society. He has no confidence in his own self-image and who he is. When he goes to these self-help groups, he actually gains little confidence in himself seeing that there are actually people who are less of a man than he is and has bigger problems than he does. The first time he actually embraces this is when he is at the self-help group for men with testicular cancer. He convinces himself that he is also a victim. He is not actually a victim to the same circumstances these men face, but feels just as emasculate as they do. This is actually what relieves his insomnia. It isn't actually until he meets Marla that he sees how fake both of them are by going to self-help groups for their own pleasure that his insomnia worsens and eventually meets Tyler.The physical appearance of the characters in the movie Fight Club is an unnoticed decision the director made that emphasizes a crucial point in the movie. The fact that the narrator projects what he wants to be through Tyler is seen through his appearance. Tyler becomes more attractive while in reality, he becoming worse off and just more battered and beat up as the movie goes on. The narrator never comes to grip with this until the final scene of the movie. Once the narrator realizes that Tyler is just what he project, he sees how far Tyler has taken his role. He finds a middle ground between Tyler's over masculinity and his low self-esteem as 'kills' Tyler once and for all.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This leads to an underground group called the Fight Club and a journey of fighting and violence embarks from there.Fight Club is a dark comedy which was directed by David Fincher who had also directed Seven, which Brad Pitt had previously acted in. Fight Club portrays controversy and diverse degrees of masculinity and extremism including terrorism. I didn't wait so long to watch it on purpose, life just worked out that way. Fight club is certainly one of my favourite movies now and I finally understand all the fight club references that are used by others in daily life. Brilliant movie, I highly recommend to those who feel stuck in a rut.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Alternative story
",,"This film impressed me because it is not the typical story you find in books or movies. I'm a fan of black humor and it is quite funny how the characters laugh at themselves, at their lives and problems, and I think even moral fags will laugh on this and will be surprised. Also I found interesting the way the story develops, which has an alternative end that one doesn't expect to happen at all, but if one pays enough attention, there are a pair of details that suggests how it might end. It is a movie that makes you think about your own life, about scary things that happen around you and you don't even notice it. So it is not actually so far from reality. Actually a friend of mine has told me he found the movie better than the book itself.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" We all felt saved
",,"The first rule of the Fight Club is that you do not speak about it. The second rule repeats the first one. It is hard to talk restrained about the ""Fight Club"", even more as being just another movie, because it is anything but just another movie. If you like watching movies in which you don't know the truth until the very end, if you like symbolism and ambiguity, bizarre twists and strange characters, then you'll be delighted! The movie, in my own opinion, speaks about the absurdity of our modern world, the alienation of modern man - but, also, I am sure that everyone can come up with its own interpretation! Where is the line between madness and sanity? Do we all have our ""alter ego""? On what are people capable of doing in order to fill the void they feel in life? These all are the questions which David Fincher imposes in this rather dark and unusual movie. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are excellent, but if you can stand neither blood nor physical aggression - I do not recommend it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" David Fincher's Best and One of My Favorites
",,"I'm just going to cut to the chase: FIGHT CLUB is awesome. I wish the marketing for the film had been a tad more honest because I put off seeing this movie until almost a decade after it was released. And, even then, I only watched it because I was at a buddy's place and needed something to watch. I was totally caught off guard because I'd always assumed it was just some testosterone-fueled beat-down with some bare bones semblance of a plot. This was before I knew of the awesome that is director David Fincher or author Chuck Palahniuk. This movie is much more than I expected, it's masterfully done, and it's developed a bizarre following on the Web. I just think it's an awesome movie. It's become one of my favorites. The movie follows a nameless protagonist (Edward Norton) who narrates the film. He's an insomniac wallowing in his empty life when he crosses paths with a charismatic soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). When the Narrator's apartment goes up in a mysterious explosion, he turns to Durden and together they form an underground fight club where men can let loose and beat the tar out of each other. The fight club is only the beginning, as the clubs gain popularity and spread across the nation. The members eventually devolve into a near cult status with Tyler Durden as their leader and the next phase of his grand schemes comes forth: Project Mayhem. Have I mentioned that FIGHT CLUB is awesome?The movie's got everything I could ask for: slick humor, brutal fights, a complex plot, and great characters. I really enjoyed SE7EN but FIGHT CLUB would be the movie that solidified David Fincher as one of my favorite directors. It's become a modern classic that I've seen on countless top-ten lists. The movie touches on a variety of subjects that brought controversy and mixed reactions from critics and audiences. The movie (or more specifically, the character of Tyler Durden) has become an icon for his anarchistic views and anti-establishment terrorism. His anger towards consumerism and our culture's obsession with its possessions is a powerful message, but his acts of domestic terrorism don't seem to hurt his cause much. There is a lot going on in this movie and, with its perfectly built reveal at the end, there is a lot to love here. Even knowing the ""surprise"" from the end before settling in to watch this movie, I was blown away. I love the dark humor in the movie, with some of the best moments occurring when characters break the fourth wall. The style of the film works perfect with the dark content and would become the first of many collaborations between Fincher and cinematographer Jeff Cronenweth with a visual signature that's easy to recognize. All of the elements of this movie come together to make one of the best modern films and a favorite to many (most of them apparently on the Internet). Really, I'm not surprised.I figure it's a given that Edward Norton is a talented actor. I've loved his performances in pretty much every movie I've seen him in. So there's nothing to worry about here as he plays the nameless Narrator, a corporate drone whose life has been much been sapped from him. Norton makes a perfect straight-man to the insanity he invites into his life. His introduction to Tyler Durden is both the best and worst thing that has ever happened to him. Durden is, of course, Brad Pitt. The best part about Pitt in the role is that it made me respect him. I'd always seen Pitt as your average Hollywood pretty-boy but his turn as a total lunatic in FIGHT CLUB proved that he had some skills. He's insane and totally charismatic. It's not hard to see how people could buy into his crazy anti-establishment preachings. He's equal parts hilarious and threatening with absolute confidence in his practices. And then there's Helena Bonham- Carter as Marla Singer, a walking corpse fresh out of a Tim Burton movie. She somehow manages to be attractive while slinking through the film looking like a meth addict. She's the ""not love interest"" to Edward Norton. A bizarre parallel to the Narrator's skewed views of reality. Finally, I have to mention Meat Loaf. Yes, for those of you who somehow haven't seen the film yet, Meat Loaf is in the movie as Bob. He's a minor character, but there's no forgetting Bob and hisuhdeformity. Good stuff. There's a hundred reasons to give this movie a chance so I recommend it. If nothing else, it's a great movie to provoke some interesting post-viewing conversation.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Masterpiece, recommended
",,"If you judge this by its title and think it's just about fighting then you're wrong, this is so much more. It's a complex and intelligent psychological thriller with a brilliant twist and a great soundtrack. It just keeps getting better and better as the film moves on. This is easily one of the best films, if not the best film I've ever seen in my life. I'm sure enough people have gone into the plot so I won't need to do that, but it's definitely an exciting and thrilling experience as well as making a big impact and goes beyond where most films go. it was on my mind all day the day after I watched it.

The movie is very entertaining and you cannot stay without talking about it. It keeps you guessing till the end and most of the people including me didn't know what would come.You cannot say that a scene after brad pit's entry was boring. But appreciation not only goes to him but to all the other actors as well. Both Brad pit and Edward Norton do a wonderful job and take the movie to another level. I loved this movie the first time I watched it, now i've seen it more than 6 times and i still love it and want to watch it. The music was also good and the acting was the best.

Edward Norton does an excellent performance as The Narrator as well as Brad Pitt in his role of Tyler Durden. If you have read the book then you will be most pleased at the quality of the movie that director David Fincher has done for it.

" Infinitely Quotable, Ruthlessly Unpredictable, Genuinely Unforgettable
",,"What started out as one of my four or five favorite films has only grown better over time. Terribly marketed in its theatrical run as a knuckle-dragging modern rendition of Bloodsport, it's sharper, wittier and ballsier than almost any major studio film of the last two decades. It's a rapidly escalating thrill ride that never hesitates to crank the dial a bit further, and the progression from droll normalcy to vulgar aggression to unsettling calm in the face of a genuine revolution is stunning. On top of all that, the film's wit is off the charts, still intelligent and amusing after almost two dozen viewings. Its cast of characters is wildly varied, and its smirk- smeared musings on the nature of modern masculinity remain timely even today. I actually get shivers every time I revisit particular scenes, with the biggest one coming - reliably - just moments before the credits roll when that Pixies tune kicks in and the city skyline takes a new shape. That's what I call an impressive parting shot. A smart, funny, thrilling, unpredictable modern classic that never takes the easy road. I can't imagine I'll ever grow tired of it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I want you to hit me as hard as you can.

On the Rosie O'Donnell Show, she gave away the ending for the movie. How could she do something like that? She spoiled the ending. Luckily I did not see that episode of Rosie O'Donnell. Shame on you Rosie O'Donnell. Just because you did not like the movie, doesn't give you the right to spoil the movie for everybody else. If I directed this movie, I would be very furious with you.

" Engaging and perplexing
",spoiler,"I don't know how much of a full ""review"" of this movie I can actually write based on one viewing, most especially as I was rather extremely hung over at least at the beginning of the movie. But actually I think that's not a bad way to watch it. This is quite an ambitious film, a lot of themes and ideas are being tossed around in the film that aren't directly anchored to the characters. Or the character as the case may be. I did really like the movie, but I thought that at times it got too slick with its presentation. It suffers from the same faults as all action films despite being a satire of action films on a certain level -- the action simply can't be intense enough to hold the hardcore audience's attention in the beginning and still ratchet up to something even more grotesque without becoming completely unreal and potentially laughable in and of itself. But you could say the same thing about some of Paul Verhoeven's best action satires like ""Starship Troopers"" that weren't even as clear as ""Fight Club"" about actually throwing the macho ethic into question. It seems to just go with the territory.So in some respects this film belongs to the same school as films like Aldrich's ""Kiss Me Deadly"" or Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"" in that it's a kind of theater of excess, basically throwing macho types out there and not so much deconstructing them as just pushing them so far over the edge that they already appear hyper-real. But I think the film sort of betrays that in some of its last sequences. That's the kind of thing that I think I'll be able to say later after I've seen it again. I do want to watch it again because certain scenes, especially the ones with Helena Bonham Carter (who I always WANT to like more than I usually do), are really appealing for some reason.The thing that holds me back from embracing the movie is that it just seemed a bit too proud of itself, and the story was a bit too ridiculous even in the end when all was explained to actually take it as seriously as it seemed to want to be taken. I'm going to see what I think ultimately though at some later point. This is the type of movie that might either go up or down in my estimation when I have a better handle on it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Great Films Club for Fight Club.
",,"If we're all just ""polishing the brass on the titanic"", and everything is going down anyway, what's the point? You get up in the morning, you go to school, study and succeed with the hope of one day becoming a doctor, a lawyer or a whatever. But if we know as we do that humanity will cease to exist in the near future, what with global warming and all, why do we bother improving existence? Shouldn't we give in to the beast we all know exists inside man? For the little time we have left, isn't a better idea to destroy, fight and kill? Anarchy seems to be the best thing to abide by in these dark times. Of course, David Fincher's Fight Club doesn't advocate these ideas; it brings them up in order for us, the viewers, to think of reasons why they are wrong. With recourse to the everyman, Edward Norton's character, only known as the Narrator, Fight Club involves us in the film. We are the Narrator. We are the ones who need every piece of furniture in Ikea catalogues for our homes in order to feel whole. However, the everyman in the film happens to have a day only seen in the movies, but we still identify with him: His luggage is lost at the airport, his house blows up and all his possessions, even the furniture, are gone. As a direct result, he is no longer a person because his possessions have been destroyed.Now he meets a guy, Tyler Durden, who tells him he could be more than his possessions, he could be free of the superficial society which creates the needs he does not (""in the hunter-gatherer sense"") actually have. He could be, that is, if he hits his friend as hard as he can. Our Narrator does; he likes it. Soon enough, other young men begin to like it too. These young men are also tired of mindless work which consists of helping a society that just enslaves them more as they make it more powerful. What's the point? So they all listen to Tyler, a fervent leader of men who initiates a club in which, every night, these young men can pound on each other. As they experience real freedom through pain and domination, Tyler, the giver of this wonderful experience, hands out homework assignments. His minions happily execute.This is how anarchy begins: A fervent and relentless leader with the wrong idea. I will not divulge any more, because of the many surprises this film has near the end. Any film with these ideas can just as easily fail. Fight Club does not. It is masterfully wrapped in a package of light, sound and images by David Fincher. The film looks good and has the smarts to back it up. Proponents of classic films see modern day cinema as being all style and no substance. Scenes are cut too fast to even get a feel for them, a little gift, they say, from television. Well I say look at Fight Club. What we have isn't so bad. It makes us think as well as being entertained. Edward Norton gives us many performances in one: he is an insomniac who knows there's a void in his life but doesn't have the will power to fill it, preferring to merely go through the motions of a life headed nowhere. Then he becomes ""enlightened"", finds meaning. Then he discovers what his life really is... Brad Pitt is a charismatic leader able to subdue any lost soul. Helena Bonham-Carter has fun with her intermediary character. Great acting and great directing have always been essential to great films. So has being thought provoking, and you know what? For 7 years ever since its release, everyone has been talking about it. It hasn't stopped; even people who hate it love to talk about it. So should we just stop our productive lives? Boys, let's just pound each other because, hey, it's more productive then anything we're doing now. It liberates us, for a given time period, because short term desire satisfaction is more useful than anything else. Somebody please prove that wrong, because that's what the film wants us to do, and I'll be damned if Tyler Durden is right.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Up to you...
",,"After reading numerous comments I feel it's safe to say that this film has gained somewhat conflicting responses from its viewers. I honestly loved this film, the story is incredible, and the execution from novel to motion picture is brilliant.The majority of the ""Hated it"" comments (that I read) were somewhat contradictory. It seemed that the people who disliked it did so because they saw a standpoint on western society that they did not like, they saw something that they disagreed with and were discomforted by it. However, I feel that this is what Fight Club is all about. This film shows the discrepancies between those who question purpose and those who don't. This movie affected me because it made me see something in myself and the people around me, something that I did not necessarily like. Not many films have the ability to that that to a person, and I feel that's what makes Fight Club so excellent.I can see how this film could be considered depressing or twisted by some viewers but I feel it's anything but.Chuck Palahniuk uses Fight Club as a vehicle to express his own thoughts and to depict the spiritual struggle of the modern man. Ironically this film provides relief for those feeling mediocre, or slaves to the ""IKEA nesting instinct"" through the catastrophic outcome of the fight club mentality. This film provokes thought by showing that the seditious behaviour of middle-aged men searching for meaning solves nothing but their own psychological battles.Casting, screenplay, cinematography and story, all excellent in my own opinion.10 Out of 10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Eward Norton's portrayal of a man heading down the path to an implosion was utterly believable. Only after seeing the film did I realize that all the people trapped in the towers are just like Jack.

Pet dogs do a pretty good job of subsuming their aggressions. But they have one hell of a pack instinct to help them out.

You will meet people with cancer looking for one last night of company with another person. You will meet supervisors trying to maintain control without putting their own career on the line. You will meet men after testicular cancer getting in touch with their feminine nurturing self. And, you will meet the narrator, wanting nothing more than to sleep.Somewhere in this mess of depressed and sad people, two people emerge.

" Fight Club-A movie that keeps you thinking for days.....
",,"Fight Club is an excellent movie that keeps you thinking about it for days....at least that's the effect it had on me. There are elements in the film that make you laugh, (such as the dialogue between the narrator and ""Tyler Durden"" when they're on the plane. ""Do you know why they put oxygen masks on planes"" ""so you can breathe"" ""Oxygen gets you high........calm as Hindu cows"" The movie can also make you confused in the way that The Wall does. It can also make you gag with all the bloody fight scenes. In short, Fight Club is somewhat a comedy and action film with a touch of creepy. Fight Club isn't for everyone, especially those who lack satirical humor. When you watch it the first time, it may be quite confusing until you reach the end where you get a better understanding of it. When you watch it the second time, you begin to notice more things (""subliminal Brad"" appearing for instance, when the narrator's doctor turns away or the quick flash of a penis as the movie comes to an end lol ) I watched the movie, trying to figure out what the message was. You think, is Fight Club the form of therapy for men? Is it about denial and self hatred that drives a person to imagine themselves as another person-someone who they'd like to be, but could never be? Is it about the conformity of society...or cheating death so that you can live tomorrow as though it were the best day of your life? You are alive the most when you're almost dead...and that was my take on the film. Marla never looking both ways when she crossed the streets...Tyler Durden and his acid burn...the men of Project Mayhem and their near death experience, and Tyler Durden giving the liquor store owner a chance to live so that he can accomplish his desire to become a vet. Whatever the movie was about, it's all in perspective, and every time you watch it...you manage to think of a new opinion. Fight Club is truly a great film, and without a doubt, an interesting one! But of course-The first rule of Fight Club is, you do NOT talk about Fight Club...so I guess you'll just have to watch it and see what it's all about!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Fight-Club Manifesto
",,"This is how `Fight Club' operates: through the emblematic `bar of soap' which decorates its marketing posters (and rather extensive ad campaign including fake office-equipment brochures), the presentation of a harmless icon gives way to a sweepingly critical exegesis of consumer capitalism. David Fincher's adaptation of the book by Chuck Palahniuk offers a quasi-postmodern view of Marxist themes as they apply to the culture of early twenty-first century capitalism. Fincher's `quasi-postmodernism' comes through in his presentation of the bi-level narrative within `Fight Club;' his Brechtian disregard for conventional aesthetic form is enacted by his consistent breaks `through the fourth wall' (i.e. narrative exegesis of plot details directed toward the audience). His use of `C.G.E.' (computer-graphical-effects) throughout the film are unobtrusive, and serve to visually heighten the suggested themes of technocratic, `corporatarchic' (ruled by corporate interests) fears which are implicit within the culture of late capitalism. Thus, while the film's narrative thread is presented in a chronologically linear fashion, the paroxysmal, disjointed presentation of its bi-leveled crescendo toward climax distances the audience in a manner similar to any non-linear film. Essentially, in postmodern terms, Fincher perfects the `verfremdung' (alienation) effect without having to resort to the manipulation of chronology. Not coincidentally, the term `verfremdung' has its roots in Marxist theory: `Capitalism is only second to slavery in its ability to alienate the worker' (Marx, Philosophical and Economic Manuscripts). This concept of `alienation' is at the root of the central tension within `Fight Club:' just as capitalism's exploitation of productive forces alienates the proletariat from the fruits of her/his labor, so does the culture of late capitalism's forced sublimation of impulsive action alienate the individual from her/his emotions. To put it plainly, the culture in which a Twinkie-factory-worker must purchase a Twinkie with a portion of her income is the same culture in which she is forced to find emotional catharsis in furtive forums of collective release. Tyler says: ""we're an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; we're slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy sh*t we don't need. We are the middle children of history, with no purpose or place. We have no great war, no great depression. Our great war is a spiritual war. Our great depression is our lives. We were raised on television to believe that we'd all be millionaires, movie gods, rock stars, but we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact. And we're very, very p***ed off."" . . .

",,"i first watched this film a week ago, and since then bought it and made my girlfriend watch it with me. the opening sequence as the camera travels thru a human body while zooming out is breathtaking. it sets the motif of the film which is looking inside of oneself. the settings really lend themselves to Jack's life and the twisted philosophy that man can only achieve happiness thru self destruction is almost believable. the film has great performances from Norton, Pitt, Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf's tits, and reaches a shocking conclusion (which is why it needs a second watching). my girlfriend didn't really like it, complaining it had no real plot (which it doesn't especially) and the only good thing is the ending. i feel this is wrong, but the ending is what we end up judging all films by, ultimately.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Glowing review, NO SPOILERS!!!!!!!!!,
",,"The Fight Club is a movie that makes you want to run out of the theatre, drink, smoke a lot, and punch your friends in the face. In a good way.  Big claps to Jim Uhlis for the script, David Fincher for the direction, and the entire cast.  For a movie to begin with extreme tension, tell a rocking good story and then peak beautifully at the end is a rare thing.  If there is a God, this should clean up at the Oscars.  Black, wicked, packed with eminently quotable lines- this is one to see AS SOON AS POSSIBLE, so you're the person who knows what The Fight Club is about, and not the person hearing endless retellings of the best bits.  One Fight Club makes up for Three Thomas Crowne affairs.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Best of 1999
",,"You would only do a flick like Fight Club if you had total disregard for the opinion of (so called) critics, because of the gargantuan leap into unknown territory.  Fight Club is more of an experience than a 2-hour way to forget yourself.  It could of been 5 hours, I would not have known the difference. Although dark, it is truly the best film I have seen, period.  Pitt and Norton are both genius...truly out there as actors.The range of Fincher is amazing...dark to serious to funny to Holy Crap!See what happens when you take a chance?

" They are stealing our intelligence

Fincher has done this before, in the fascist ""Seven"".  ""Memento"" is not fascist, and is more intelligent, but uses the same trick.  Ok, people, c'mon, we can do better than this.  Do you liked the intelligent subtetly of ""Sixth Sense"" and/or ""Unbreakable""? (the real minority movies that only a bunch of people liked because they asked for your brain).  Do you watch non-USA films? (I don't think so, and I'm NOT speaking about the Hollywood Foreign Film fodder for americans like ""Life is Beautiful"").  I'm tired of posting negative anti-comments reviews, but unfortunately there is only one IMDB, and I'm trying to do a little bit of film education here.  I promisse to write about the movies that I like (the ones that generally have only five comments -or none- in their page).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A heap of dung masquerading as a good movie.
",spoiler,"Wow... What can I say about ""Fight Club""?  It's a real pity that so many have been brainwashed into thinking this is a good film.
*Spoilers ahead*""Fight Club"" starts out just fine.  We meet the depressed narrator, who finds solace in self-help groups.  Later, he meets Tyler Durden, with whom he starts Fight Club, a secret club in which men beat the snot out of each other to free their minds.-On a side note, isn't it interesting how these young men can repeatedly hit each other so hard and receive nothing more than cuts and bruises?  I'm guessing that many young viewers were inspired to start their own fight clubs only to nix the idea when they broke their hands on the first punches.-Oh well... back to the movie... I'll try to keep this brief.  Tyler Durden goes on to brainwash fight club members, and soon they're your stereotypical cult.  They go on to commit random acts of vandalism.  More nonsense ensues until Tyler hatches his ultimate plan, the destruction of all financial records in the country to level the playing field.  But wait!  The movie doesn't end there!  We need a surprise ending!  It turns out that Tyler Durden really is the narrator!  Like I care.  If that isn't enough, our narrator then kills Tyler Durden by sticking a gun in his own mouth and pulling the trigger.  Why do so many filmmakers feel the need to include surprise endings?  Such nonsense.""Fight Club"" is far from insightful.  If you want to see a movie along the same vein that has something useful to say, check out Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange,"" or, if you prefer, ""Fight Club minus bullshit.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Edward Norton and Brad Pitt we're both fantastic and fit their roles perfectly, and they both had great synergy together. Helena bonham carter was also great, and is also what i consider her best performance to date. Jared Leto and Meat Loaf both portrayed their roles greatly and were also really good. The cinematography was AMAZING, with the elaborate camera shots and positioning you feel like you are right there watching everything unfold. The ideas and themes that this movie gives out also serve an important purpose in the world and still remain relevant today. Overall Fight Club is a Fantastic movie that I could go on forever about.

",,"Fight Club is for me, one of those rare examples when I like the movie better than the book. Without giving any spoilers, they have two different endings. One thing that makes this an instant classic is the use of lighting to set the mood throughout. Another thing is the repeated dialogue motif's, that help craft Fight Club into its own bleak ideological environment. The movie takes you into its own world, until you question whether you buy into Tyler Derden's mad vision. Stellar performances from Helena Bonham Carter, Edward Norton, and Brad Pitt, not to mention - Meatloaf! 2 thumbs up!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Agressive
",,"This film is irrefutably bright and creative in its adressing of consumerism and attempting to find a meaningful exstance in a sleepwalking world. The protagonists are easy to identify with, at least in concept, as they search for sensation in their boring lives. This identification immediately helps draw the audience in, and keeps us there with flashy fist fights and emotionally packed dramatic scenes. The pacing and editing of the scenes that are meant to feel like a music video hit the mark with precision, and the violence, which could feel over the top and unnecessary, becomes a simple means to an end, as we embrace the events in time to the audio. The whole movie is melodramatic and unnecessarily high strung, but given that the acting is well done, and the subject matter is somewhat commentary on society, it works to convey the intended message.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Worth watching, not sure about revisiting
",spoiler,"I've just finished watching this film for the first time -- almost 20 years after its release, without prior reading of neither any reviews, nor the original book.Cinematography-wise, it's really good. Plot-wise, well... that depends on what you expect. Noticing ""a cult classic"" coming from a big Hollywood studio made me feel suspicious. Half into the film, I felt it was going a bit too far with craziness. Closer to climax, I felt fooled and robbed. An hour later, it all started to fall into place. :-)Upon watching, I've read some of the reviews here, both positive and negative. They gave some food for thought. Some people liked 1/3, 1/2, or 2/3 of the film. Some considered it a work of a genius. Others called it dumb and unrealistic.My opinion is that of course it is not a real-life story that is portrayed. It's more of a pitiful, somewhat infantile fantasy running through the head of, or just a dream of, an average person who is injured, tired, exhausted. And when viewers are engaged into the story, the film suddenly says: ""I have just sold you a ***cheap furniture brand name here*** of philosophy, you miserable average nobodies. Look -- it's you in all of the scenes!"" A bold statement to make in a mainstream product, I would say! :-DMore on plot holes and lack of realism --
Speaking of dreams and nightmares, there is usually not much logic/consistency in those. They just symbolically reflect daily life. On the brink of waking up, people try to force events in dreams sometimes for a satisfying outcome, and fall flat at that. The latter easily explains film's finale, for example.Conclusion: It's worth watching for all the good bits that it has. Not sure if it's worth revisiting once you feel you understand what it is all about.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" David Fincher and his masterpiece
",,"David Fincher's (DF) masterpiece is Fight Club (FC) (1999).DF who's one of the most innovative and considered a great filmmaker himself worked really hard on producing FC.FC is an american film from 1999 based on the 1996 novel by Chuck Palahniuk.The plot of the film is basically in summary is.......Edward Norton plays the unnamed protagonist, referred to as the narrator, who is discontented with his white-collar job. He forms a ""Fight Club"" with soap maker Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, and they are joined by men who also want to fight recreationally. The narrator becomes embroiled in a relationship with Durden and a dissolute woman, Marla Singer, played by Bonham Carter.The director and the cast compared the film to Rebel without a cause (1955) and The Graduate (1967). They said its theme was the conflict between a generation of young people and the value system of advertising.This film is a cinematic feast. As a Sri Lankan film fanatic that troubled rebellious men is a talked about factor and loved by filmmakers and fans alike.Fight Club's got some hard hitting quotes for the audiences.Tyler Durden : The things you own end up owning you.Narrator : I found freedom. Losing all hope was freedom.Tyler Durden : It's only after we've lost everything that we're free to do anything.Tyler Durden : Listen up, maggots. You are not special. You are not a beautiful or unique snowflake. You're the same decaying organic matter as everything else.Narrator : This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time.Tyler Durden : You're not your job. You're not how much money you have in the bank. You're not the car you drive. You're not the contents of your wallet. You're not your fu*king Khakis. You're the all singing, all-dancing crap of the world.Tyler is like an annihilistic priest. His words are true but dangerous and if you blindly follow them it's chaos. And that is what you see in the film.DF's approach and style in films are basically follows.Fincher likes to map out camera movement with computer-generated imagery, commission intricate sets, gets heavily involved in post-production, and re-shoot footage after the principal photography has wrapped. He does not normally use hand-held cameras when he shoots a film, preferring cameras on a tripod, this most frequent use of a hand-held camera was for Se7en, in which five scenes were shot that way. Fincher likes to confuse audiences with his camerawork. Sometimes, it is difficult to determine whether a shot is human-controlled, motion-controlled or computer-generated imagery. Close ups are as little as possible. The interior of a refrigerator can be seen in a number of Fincher's films; this can be seen as part of character and story development.All of these are in FC.As a Sri Lankan many films like Machan (2008), Mille Soya Buongiorno Italia (2004) and Motorcycle (2016) depicts the internal and external struggles of the youth and middle aged men of Sri Lanka.And FC will be the one and only depiction of the American man's perspective in 1990's on consumerism.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The book by Chuck Palahniuk was perfect for a movie: vivid, powerful, challenging, original, unpredictable. Considering how perfectly formed the book already was, the screenplay would have been a doddle.Some very interesting themes are explored - consumerism, class warfare, multiple-personality disorder, male bonding, terrorism and anarchy - without being judgemental.Direction is spot-on. Perfect cinematography, pacing and editing. The twists and nuances of the book are captured perfectly.Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are perfectly cast as the two lead characters, and deliver in spades. Helena Bonham Carter is a strange selection to take on the role of Marla, as she tends to act in Shakespearean dramas and other period pieces. However, despite this, her performance is very convincing.An absolute classic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

When I watched it first time, I felt something like a dark smile in my heart, Someone else was laughing inside me, I whispered to myself ""exactly, this movie is what I'm looking for"".
There is no doubt that the film speaks more than what is presented in its general form. It is a matter of life.
The violence is the inherently rebellious part of the systems of reality, which men aspires to emerge from the patterns of consumption and routine in life. It is an attempt to break time, ideas and habituation. It's a discussion of all the important issues ""consumer life critique, waste of capacity, request for assistance, What does life mean to you?, Do you really live your own life?, defending manhood in a consumer system, defending your beliefs by altering logic .. etc""
David Fincher with Brad Pitt and Edward Norton created an intellectual and revolutionary masterpiece in a time when human became meaningless.
The Fight Club is the deepest expression of our Psychological defeat.

" A Nonsensical story with some highlights
",spoiler,"The film is so highly acclaimed so I thought it would be a good viewing experience but I was wrong.The first act of the film is really strong, Edward Norton gives a terrific performance and it's interesting to watch the characters insomnia play out. I love the subtle hints given towards the final twist of Norton being Tyler Durdon.
Yet Brad Pitt's introduction is where the film becomes dull, First I want to say that Brad Pitt is great in this but his character isnt.
We are expected to believe that Edward Norton assembled a devoted cult by beating himself up, that he has knowledge of explosives despite not having any known explosives background. There is a scene in the film where Edward Norton walks past Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter having sex and since Norton and Pitt are the same person it makes no sense how he can be in two places at once.
The Third act gets better but has some problems, mainly that despite Norton now knowing that he is Tyler Durdon, he still allows himself to beat up himself. Edward Norton even survives the most unrealistic suicide attempt, although I love the very end scene with the building blowing up, mainly because of the song.Overall, this film is given too much credit and acclaim for something that isn't worth it. David Fincher has proven he can do better with his film Se7en, this was more alike to Alien3.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Beautiful, yet underwhelming
",,"I just watched Fight Club (which was ashamedly the first time I had done so), and I must say I was thoroughly underwhelmed.This could be a problem with the hype around it meaning my expectations were set really high, but at the same time I never see the hype around many David Fincher productions. This film is similar to David Fincher's other critical success - se7en. Both films are beautifully shot, Fincher's cinematography is characteristically dark but captivating and beautiful. However Fight Club, much like se7en, fails to capture me in its narrative. The message of this film is that consumerism is making everyone a slave to society, suppressing every man's inner urges and masculinity, so people should be allowed to express their inner primal urges (but not let it entirely consume you). This is well discussed in films, and not new, but to the film's credit it deals with it in an imaginative - but not subtle - way. Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter are great, but I failed to get invested in any of them to be honest. A well shot and imaginative yet underwhelming film. 7/10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I loved it how the entire movie was presented from the narrator's point of view. We see his visions, we believe him, we live the story together with him.There is a passive love in this movie, that's what I'll call it. It's emotions are often portrayed through the passive voice of the narrator, the lighting, the costumes. Everything in Fight Club adds on to the effect. And this creates a profound connection with the characters.I fell in love with this movie to such an extent that I watched it twice alone and once with my friend.

The movie is about 2 men who are tired of their jobs, so they start a club where all you do is beat each other up for as long as you want. And you can't spread the word about the club. The plot is one of many things that make the movie stand out.

" A complex, stylish film overrated in its uniqueness
",spoiler,"Fight Club definitely has style and is exciting to watch, with complex characters driven by their actions and a great plot twist at the end. The actors were all good, and Fincher does a good job of maintaining consistency in what's really happening and showing the narrator's perspective. As always with adaptations, some interesting exposition in details is lost, such as how exactly Tyler did his work at night and how Project Mayhem worked. The ending, which is so beloved, works and makes sense but isn't exceptional. Why does Tyler die when the narrator shoots his cheek - because he finally takes control of his life, because he's no longer afraid? It's plausible and there's nothing wrong with it, but it certainly didn't blow me away. There are plenty of good themes, and the contrasts of Tyler and the narrator as opposing extremes in problems with society were enjoyable to consider. I don't think there was anything wrong with Fight Club, but I also don't think it's anything more than a decent movie with a good twist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",,"Every body who has seen this film must have been surprised that ""revealing"" moment. (If I wrote the detailed stuff about the revelation it would be a spoiler.) Then how did the director trick us? I think the way how dialogues are written works the most. It is of course meant to be held between 2 people and this is why we call it dialogue. SO this is our instant/general assumption; there are two ""different"" people in the screen and they talk to each other. 
I think the director used this general way to think to trick us, and us being tricked is essential because there is the revelation moment and this is the powerful punchline in this movie.

" One in a life time opportunity
",spoiler,"Although I'm breaking the 1st and 2nd rule of the Fight Club by talking about Fight Club, I reckon it's for a good reason as I hope to recruit more people into this club. This movie is a philosophical movie that reveals the flaws of the modern human society. The entire movie is bordered on fiction and reality that interplay each other and the vehicle of the plot that moves the needle seem to be the brief lapses in the thinking of a person who begins to muse on his life. The flow of story is told through the eyes of a person who tries to break free from that materialistic life of consumerism by engaging in a taboo, breaking free from that commercial lifestyle of 9-5 and the subsequent desire to purchase and consume products. Edward Norton portrays the protagonist who gradually realizes the flaws of the consumer culture, and begins to untether himself as he fights his way to enlightenment to find a deeper meaning in life. there is so much philosophical underlinings that are abstruse but can be deciphered by the audience through reflecting on the reality and the delusions presented in form of Tyler Durden and his club. In some sense, there is a Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) in all of us, a better us that wants us to break free from our slumber in a lethargic loop of constant gratification of our material desire for things that give us the momentary happiness. This movie seems to use Edward Norton as the pariah who joins the Fight Club that revolts against materials and promotes individualism and self-empowerment through gaining knowledge of the true human potential for self-awareness and greatness. This is one of those rare movies that is suspended in a delirium that crosses between fact and fact, and it is has a surfeit philosophical treasures glimmering beneath the surface, waiting to be extracted by those who are willing to dig them out by joining the Fight Club and finding their inner Tyler Durden.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A subtle film
",spoiler,"I have not read the novel, so I can only comment on the film. I was surprised to see that most reviews have been focused on the anti-consumerism message, which is certainly an aspect of the movie but is only the surface layer. SPOILERS AHEAD. If we ask ourselves why at the end of the film the Narrator kills Brad Pitt's character, this begs the question: was Tyler Durden a positive or a negative influence on the Narrator? If we revisit Durden's actions throughout the movie, it becomes increasingly clear that his influence on the Narrator is a negative one, despite Durden's efforts to convince him (and us) otherwise. Durden cleverly plays his card as a liberator, a knight in shining armor who has come to push the Narrator out of his dull existence and into a life of wild excitement and adventure. But Durden's reckless, dangerous behavior transpires through his every action: his relationship with Marla is nothing short of crazed, his violent tendencies are nothing short of insane, his building of an army for large scale destruction of property is nothing short of terrorism, and his sole goal is to dominate and influence the Narrator in order to ultimately bring about his ruin. So who is Tyler Durden? I would argue that he is not just an alter ego as other reviews proposed, rather he is the Narrator's EGO itself. Our ego uses clever disguises and non-sequiturs such as ""your life is too dull therefore do something that may destroy you just to feel that you're alive"" to drive us to extreme behaviors that look enticing in the beginning but in the end prove self-destructive. As an example, just before crashing the car Durden tells the Narrator to stop trying to control things and to just ""Let go!"". A good concept in itself, this makes Durden appear almost as a Zen philosopher - only in this case Durden's intent is for the Narrator to surrender himself to him (Durden). Durden creates the perfect illusion of freedom, which is actually an abandonment to our ego's whims that brings our downfall instead. The ego fools us and blinds us by making us identify with it and taking us away from our true self. This is why in the beginning the Narrator isn't even aware of Durden's actions, he sees only pieces of them until Durden's identity is revealed when they meet at the hotel. This portrayal is pure genius in my opinion. The end of the film is uplifting - the Narrator does achieve true freedom by killing his ego, arguably the most difficult endeavor we can undertake which requires tremendous courage and sincerity. The collapsing buildings are perhaps a symbol of the price the Narrator had to pay for taking too long to extricate himself from the clutches of his ego. David Fincher is an undeniable talent in filmmaking, I just wish he had allowed for more time to show the transformation that happened in the Narrator after killing Durden, although naturally every adaptation comes with its own constraints.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" You Do Not Talk About Fight Club
",,"All the clues are there-- probably every frame analyzed by huge cult followers. Fight Club is a film that is almost begged to be rewatched, yet there's still something that compels me to not give it all the credit it has garnered. There will be plenty of you that are huge fans of this film, and those that haven't seen it may end up really enjoying it. So, I will make sure not to give away the mind-numbing twist, unlike Rosie O'Donnell (she spoiled it on her talk-show).Let's start with the main ingredients (of the cast and crew, not for soap). Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are brilliantly cast for their roles. Norton fits the insomniac 100% even if his narration dulls slightly after two-thirds of the film, and, along with his iconic wardrobe, Brad Pitt has the perfect look of a rabble-rouser type of friend. And when is Helena Bonham Carter not awesome? There are also fun parts for Meat Loaf and an unrecognizable Jared Leto. Needless to say, I have no issue with the acting.As regards to the skewed time line, I have zero complaints about the first 45 minutes or so (Pitt's monologue for the fight club is pretty dang cool) of the film. The setup is all there with some clever dialogue, especially for subsequent viewings, and David Fincher employs a certain craftiness to how he envisions the film to play out. It's not so much that the film had too many issues, but my vision and expectations for what to come were basically on the opposite spectrum of what did happen. What I can say that is that the writing started becoming as crazed as the protagonists portrayed in the plot that followed. To pinpoint a little better what I am trying to get across; basically, I felt the film took a turn for the worst as soon as Project Mayhem was mentioned. I was fine swimming with the sharks in the deep end the movie was already in, but they lost me when the water started to fall off the side of their flat perceived world.It's becoming a much bigger problem than I anticipated to discuss this film (despite explicit directions to not talk about Fight Club) the way I should be able to, but to do so is too compromising to those that haven't watched it, so hopefully I can refrain. As I say that, let's talk about the ending without talking about it: I'm not a fan of it. The anti-establishment campaigns of the cult army club thingamajig went too philosophical in its uprising message. The most basic way to express my opinion on it is to say that it bit off more than it could chew. I believe a smaller payload with a different direction for the fight club could have made the twist more rewarding. In its strange defense, the ending is exactly what was needed to propel Fight Club to the level of cult status (ironic and satirical for an ironic and satirical film, I got that). Achieving this cult following does not cement a film to greatness necessarily, but it causes viewers to at least try understanding better the effects and results from the film. With that perspective, I do understand the brashness of the storytelling that captivated a set of audience. In fact, I would probably admit to recommending this film because of iconic moments and the uniqueness of its entirety; however, I will keep my outsider place of personally believing it is overrated in what it accomplished.

" A film that will last the ages, and whatever comes of humanity, Fight Club will have predicted it long ago.
",,"Fight Club enters into the VERY elite group of films that have surpassed the novel from which they are drawn. While the book is a great read and still hold the reader in a death grip it can at times be confusing and the lead to the finale tricky to follow. Whereas the film is impossible to look away from. It's grit and acid strong taste juxtapose it's dark comedy and aggressive realism. I truly believe along with may others, that what has been birthed here is arguably, the greatest film ever made, and certainly in the top ten. 
With phenomenal performances from both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton, alongside Helena Bonham Carter playing an evermore enthralling Marla Singer Fight Club is a film for the world, and whatever the fate of humanity in the years to come Fight Club will still be here, still be relevant and we will still be saying, I know this, because Tyler knows this.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Classic as it is
",,"I view movies differently after seeing this movie, because it broke down doors. Then there's the tiny issue of the story of Fight Club, penned by Chuck Palahniuk the story is nothing short of incredible, a pure shock-value social commentary on the state of the world at the end of the century. ""Fight Club"" an aggressive, confrontational, often brutal satire that is quite possibly a brilliant masterpiece. Taking the ""Choose life,"" anti-consumerism rant at the beginning of ""Trainspotting,"" and carrying it to its logical -- albeit extreme -- conclusion this is a big budget, mainstream film that takes a lot of risks by biting the hand that feeds it. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti-consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. The film is a cinematic punch to the head as it challenges the status quo and offers a wakeup call to people immersed in a materialistic world where those who have the most stuff, ""win."" I think that Fincher's film wants us to tear all that down, reject corporate monsters like Starbucks and Blockbuster, and try to figure out what we really want out of life. It's almost as if the film is suggesting salvation through self-destruction. And it is these thought-provoking ideas that makes ""Fight Club"" a dangerously brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" It earned its place in history
",,"This week I watched Fight Club (1999). It wasn't what I expected at all. The film really was artistic and definitely felt like a 90s film. I will admit that I did not see the plot twist coming. I do think the film was good, but I wouldn't say it was my cup of tea per se (but I think I knew that going into it). I really liked the way that the characters were set up and how the main character met Marla Singer. The film was definitely engaging. I can't say that I necessarily felt anything watching the film other than the occasional disgust when the characters would do something gross or the occasional weird feeling when the story went somewhere strange. The editing is probably one of the best things about the film and I feel that it may have triggered its own editing genre that seems to have what I call the pause and whiplash effect. The narrator will be speaking, the visuals pause as he explains, then the visual is unpaused and takes the viewer through a whiplash sequence of shots before returning to a normal pacing. The perspective of this film was told from the main character, who also served as the film's narrator. I'm not sure that there was a point to the film other than crazy people can lead an army. I think that it was more about telling an interesting story than serving much of a deeper meaning. The payoff for this film comes toward the end when we realize who is really in control and when the main character achieves his goals, even if they were oddly screwed up goals. All in all I'm glad to have finally seen this movie and can see why it has taken its place in film history's hall of fame.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Violently Touching
",,"""Fight Club"" (1999) is a magical mental drama masterpiece. The film is told from the perspective of an insomniac office worker, the narrator, played by Edward Norton. He tries to conquer his sleeping issue by attending support groups where he meets Marla, played by Helena Bonham Carter, and begins an uncomfortable relationship. He soon meets crazy man Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, and form the notoriously evolving underground fight club. Through the escapades of the fight club develops another other worldly challenge, appropriately named ""Project Mayhem."" This film is full of twists, turns, and if the viewer plays close attention, reveals to the finale.David Fincher is remarkably on point with the pacing of this film. Moments where the viewer would anticipate slower cuts, it speeds up just enough to keep them interested while allowing other areas to breath. The edits were timely and purposeful adding a level of excitement that might have been taken away if edited differently. I found the point of this film to be more serious and caring than the title implies. Even though this film has violent moments of fighting and vandalism, it's refreshing to know that the story lends itself to a reset of the world, allowing the commoner to rid themselves of the negatives of the world. The payoff, though slightly unfortunate, is well worth the watch. I highly recommend this film to anyone needing a little excitement with a heartfelt message.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" A Statement of a Film
",,"Let's ignore the advice and talk about 'Fight Club'. This film was a milestone; although it bombed at the box office, Fincher's cinematic language left a mark that can still be felt now, 14 years later, on many current releases. The film has a raw energy that grips me every time I watch it. Whether it is a very clever satire or pure testosterone going on a rampage - both are fine by me.

And boy was I blown away. It's unique, looks at the issue of the protagonist in a fresh way. The film urges you to keep an open mind and not disbelieve anything. The movie doesn't start in the most intriguing way but if you look deeply then you'll see how fascinating it is. It's about understanding that even if we think our choices are ours to make, society makes them for us. We all have struggled to stay within society's normal and not breaking out. There are people who can relate so much with the protagonist it's scary. It's telling you, you are not alone.

" Classic? Are You Sure?
",,"David Fincher is a great director, Alex McDowell is a truly innovative production designer and Chuck Palahniuk is a good writer, so, when the two came together, we knew that there was no way that the product of their collaboration would be bad. In fact, it seems most people are of the opinion that it is very nearly a work of genius, and, while it's true that, in places, Fight Club does occupy that territory, it's not genius in its entirety. Let me explain. Fight Club starts off well as a well- observed satire on masculinity and machismo, but, then, in its last third, for some strange reason, any sense of humour is abandoned and the film starts to advocate what it was taking a swipe at. This change of tone and unevenness is unfortunately too distracting for me and, consequently, I'm afraid I can't see Fight Club as an absolute classic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" This review contains some spoiler's, don't blame me, i love this movie :) 12C
",,"In this review i will present a comedy and drama movie that i watched recently named ""Fight Club"" released in 1999 based on the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk. In the movie was directed by David Fincher and stars Brad Pitt. Edward and Helena Bonham Carter.A nameless first person narrator played by the star Edward Norton attends report groups in attempt to suede his emotional state and relieve his insomnia. When he meets Marla interpreted by the actress Helena Bonham Carter, another face attendee of the support groups, his life sens to become a little more bearable. However, when he associates himself with Tyler, played by the known actor Bra Pitt, he is dragged into an underground fight club. Together the two men spiral out of control and engage in competitive rivalry for love and power. The way the film is directed is brilliant and the manner of David Fincher would appeal to any watcher. What i liked the most were the scenes which had lot of energies and also included many interesting details in shots too. I was pleasantly surprised by the camera's techniques which created a focusing illusion on Edward Norton's character, displaying how he feels alone. I believe that the cast was exceptionally and the actors provides some elements benefice for the movie. Moreover, the soundtrack is perfect for the film and it's numerous themes. Like the film, it jumps all over the place and comes at you from different directions.In conclusion, ""Fight Club"" is a high quality, impressive and my all time favorite movie and i would recommend it to anyone.This review contains some spoiler's, don't blame me, i love this movie :)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" A feast of thoughts
",spoiler,"I am not some professional movie critics, but someone who is fond of watching films. I have seen hundreds of suspense films, but Fight Club is the best among them. Some people may say that the Mulholland Drive is the most famous, and I agree, but the Fight Club is definitely the deepest suspense film. Trust me, as long as you could finish watching this film, the feast of thoughts will absolutely impress you.The story starts with an insomnic car recycler, Jack, who attended several benevolent societies in order to have a good sleep. Occasionally Jack meets a woman called Marla, who attends the same societies but has no physical injuries, just like Jack. So finally they shared the attendances to benevolent societies. Tyler, the soap dealer and the unruly man whom Jack meets on the plane, steps into Jack's life. Jack's home was destroyed by the explosion of natural gas and all his favorite furniture vanishes. Jack moved to Tyler's home on paper street and after a while, they organized the fight club. After a series of ""terrorism"" activities, this club is all over the country, which becomes a sheer crime organization. During this process, the relationships between Jack, Tyler, Marla and other fight club members become complex, and after several conflicts, Tyler decides to explode twelve buildings, and Jack determines to stop him. And eventually, Jack realized that Tyler was one of his personalities and killed Tyler by shooting at himself. In the last scene, Jack and Marla stand together and watch the collapse of those buildings outside. It is the shallowest meaning the film shows to audience.With the ridiculous actions, decisions, principals and characteristics, this film gives people a sense of absurdity. So audience mainly concludes them as the results motivated by the mental issue Jack is suffering from. However, when you deeply study this film, you will find some interesting things.Firstly, the personalities and the fight club. Is it possible for such a great organization with great population governed by Jack individually? Or is it logical that by exploding the buildings, people's deposits will turn to none? A scene when Jack goes into the bar, there is no one in it, but two seconds later when the camera shifts to the same scene, there is a barman standing right there. So is it possible that the fight club was Jack's imagination? Or is it possible that everyone in the club is Jack's personality, it's just some of them have names, like Bob, while others don't have? It is worth thinking.Secondly, the explosion. When the smiling face depicted by a explosion happens to a building in West Franklin, does it look like the sticker besides Tyler's phone in his house? The building where Jack fights with Tyler is right on Franklin Street, and it seems similar to the exploded building. And the scene of the explosion looks very like the scene which Jack's home is destroyed, so is it possible that all of the explosions are all the same?Thirdly, the identity of Marla. It seems totally impossible that Marla shows up in a testicular cancer benevolent society without anyone's rejection. What's more, the dressing and behavior of Tyler and Marla looks always similar: cigarettes and sunglasses, and sometimes the same clothes. On the walls outside Marla's apartment reads many ""myself"" and ""I like myself"", which also indicates something. One classic sentence Jack says is like ""Marla and Tyler never show up together"". Thus, whether Marla is real or not is worth considering.Fourthly, the street's name. Tyler's window-less house is on Paper Street, and the people who have ever been to the house include: Tyler, Jack, Marla and other club members. We already know that those are all the characters imagined by Jack, or Jack's personalities, and no one else has ever been to the house. With all the information, can we indicate that even the house is Jack's imagination? Other clues including the yin and yang desks, the death of Bob, the sentences about cancers, the accidents and the poet of ""Worker bees can leave, even drones can fly away, the queen is their slave"" all leads to the answer that Jack is the ""queen"", while others, even including his furniture, are all his personalities -- the worker bees and drones.At the end of the film, when Jack gets rid of his anti-personality - - Tyler and stands with his kind personality -- Marla, watching the collision of buildings outside, I think that Jack actually dies. But anyway, since this film has a lot of clues and confusing scenes, there definitely are many perspectives to explain, and my analysis is just one of them.Maybe this film has some mistakes that could not be explained, but as long as the director concludes them as Jack's imagine, they all make senses. That's why I like it, not sheer perfect, but turns every defects into merits. With the intriguing scenes, various characters and personalities, meaningful sentences and provoking transitions, this film is really worth watching and studying. I strongly recommend those who haven't watched this film have a try, and those who have watched try a brain storm, and I'm sure that's going to be interesting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" with over 3,000 reviews, this movie does NOT need another
",spoiler,"So why am I giving it one? Simple. I do not believe that it is worth all the hype it gets to this day. The film is loaded with problems, varying from one extreme to another, and fans of this favorite will gladly overlook these problems, or will be quick to defend it with their means of logic and common sense. Wonderful. The problems of the film that are apparent, are as follows, and certainly not limited to: 1. Overabundance of masculine energy! Sure, you know what you are getting yourself into when the movie is titled as so, but it cannot be denied that it is just ""too much of a good thing."" Sugar is great, but do you want your drink drowning in it? 2. Disturbingly violent. And I am used to violence in film. The manner in which it is displayed, however, makes a world of difference. The realism of the violence is there, and most of it seems needless. 3. No set direction for the story to go. The film, instead, relies heavily on layers of several ""WTF"" moments, one after the other. Some believe this is just part of the mystery, but I tend to disagree. 4. Not logical. Not logical at all. Which part? Any of it. Take a quick research look into mental illness, anti social behavior, not to mention the ungodly ending to this film. None of it adds up. So I did not come here to bash this work. Simply put, I believe it is over rated. Severely. I do get the point the movie tries to get across, he only fights one person in the entire movie. He fights himself. He cannot cope with the fact...how can I be all these people, and have all these jobs? It's because you don't sleep, you're all but one entity. As we are all. Was the ending real, or was that all made up in the insanity within himself? Many questions are asked, but we do not get the answers. The film just chooses not to deliver them. I do have some things that I love about Fight Club. The cinematography is excellent. And the movie is loaded to the brim with very intelligent quotes. ""On a long enough time line, the survival rate for everyone drops to zero."" Love that line! And yet, people still decide to waste their time watching TV. The casting was good, I thought it could do without Meat Loaf, but that's just my opinion. The story itself is a bit weak, almost too weak. The movie over extends itself past boundaries it should not surpass, and yet it is saved each time by another element that actually makes the film work. Weather it was by trial and error, or intended, does not matter, the film does work well with its components, each gear seems to turn another, and yet it does ABSOLUTELY NOTHING to master anything as a whole. Hidden away some place safe, is the emotional part to this movie. It does a good job hiding it away, preserving the ""manly"" feel of this all. I admit, I am more in touch with my feminine side, which is probably the reason why Fight Club does nothing for me. It cannot be denied that this film is just not worth the hype it has, and yet on the same token, it has earned it. I just want to point out this film bombed at the box office in 1999, and if you do not believe me, look at how much the budget is, and compare it to the gross. See? Lost a lot of money. I understand fully that this is a favorite among many, and I understand many may be seeing this a little more different then the way I am seeing it. Well. Now. That is why there's over 3,000 reviews, now isn't it?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Ironic Anti-Corporate Message
",spoiler,"The 90s were a time that focused on anti-corporate propaganda, where movies were openly mocking the corporate American life style where people were drones that worked their 9-to-5 job looking for an escape from the repetitiveness of their lives. Movies such as the Fight Club depicted their main protagonists in dull business attire, bland colors to drive the point home of the bland lives that these characters were living until their opportunity for release came along. Camera movement in these scenes were particularly slow and the camera would only zoom into Norton's face to emphasize the daily struggle he was experiencing in his life. After an explosion at his apartment, Norton is given the opportunity to escape the norm of everyday life as everything he has done in his life thus far is now gone. Fight Club mocks this scene as the first part of its anti-corporate message where Norton's entire collection Ikea furniture is now destroyed. However, Norton was lucky he recently met Tyler Durden, a man who encompasses all the traits that Norton wishes he also encompassed, a man who actively destroys the social norms such as splicing pornographic content into a family film and peeing in soup containers at a high-class restaurant. With nowhere else to turn, Norton seeks out Durden in an attempt to chase a life away from corporate structure. The house, is run down and decrepit, with a basement that floods anytime it rains, sketchy electrical connections and one that barely provides shelter, one that most Americans would choose not to live in. It is when he moves in with Durden that Norton learns of Fight Club, an organization that allows men to free themselves and express their masculinity by fighting one another until the other taps out. In the fight scenes themselves, the lighting stages the fights as being the focal point of the images, but blacks out along the first row of the ring of other fighters symbolizing that these fights are salvation for these men who are done with their mundane lives. The lighting in these scenes also tie into the movies anti-corporate message saying that nothing matters to these men in the outside world, the only thing that matters are these fights. As the movie progresses more subtle changes occur. As Norton chases his more perfect life, we see Durden become a more prominent character in the film, taking up more screen time and Norton seeming to suffer from his insomnia more severely than ever. Durden pushes Norton to become more daring in his actions to chase a high of living that Fight Club itself can no longer satisfy. This manifests itself as Project Mayhem which becomes the physical destruction of corporate life in the movie as the Fight Club evolves and becomes a terrorist group focused on destroying shops and statues that worship the corporate life. The ultimate goal is the destruction of ten skyscrapers among the city, but steps are taken to ensure that only the corporations are attack and innocent civilians are not caught up in the destruction. To emphasize the actual destruction, multiple camera angles are used which and at the point of impact, slow motion is used. The destruction also sees the lighting transition from dark before the terroristic act begin to the scenes being lit up by the explosions to show a relief on corporate America from the chains that Norton and Durden feel as though they are unshackling for the common corporate worker. However, some of the anti-corporate messages are lost when product placement sees the movie ironically being endorsed by the corporations that it is trying to portray as destroying the American dream. The thrill ride and twist ending make Fight Club an enjoyable movie, if not one that almost was lost in how ironic it could become.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Fight Club Review
",spoiler,"Do you really know when one situation ends and another begins? Are there gaps in your memory, where for some reason, you can't remember how you got somewhere? No? Well this is the case for the unnamed narrator in Fight Club. Looking for change, a depressed insomniac living a gray boring life is looking for relief; relief from the humdrum grind of his life. This leads into the emotion of the movie. Darkness shrouds the film at every corner. Seemingly to represent the crushing weight of uselessness the narrator feels towards his life. The darkness that encompasses nearly every scene almost allows the viewer to feel the weight and pressure of the narrators life. A justification for using this type of lighting may be because of how the story was being told. Narration occurred solely by the unnamed narrator, the main character. The audience is only allowed to see the story through his perspective. This leads into time gaps that occur in the film. Since the audience can only see the story from his perspective, the audience is limited to the knowledge that he has. For example, Tyler Durden, his alter-ego remains as a separate person throughout most of the movie. Time-gaps are also evident This limitation of perspective allows the narrator to shape what the audience thinks of him. Towards the end of the movie, the audience gets a glimpse of reality through the cameras in the parking garage. There are many situations within Fight Club that try to clue the audience into the fact that Tyler Durden and the narrator are actually the same person. These become much more evident towards the end of Fight Club. Tyler tells the narrator not to talk to anyone about him. This is an attempt to prevent others from revealing who Tyler Durden really is. It's actually a very intelligent way to partition his mind like this. However, the narrator himself realizes something is wrong very early in the movie. At one points he attempts to consult a professional asking him if he could die from insomnia or narcolepsy which involves appearing in places but can't remember how you got there. This scene shows directly that the narrator is experiencing this and is worried. If the narrator had gotten professional help and was prescribed medicine to treat his neurological illness, the acts of terrorism at the end of the movie might not have ever happened. A possible suggestion towards the narrators neurological illness was the beginning animation. During the starting credits, a brain and neurons with electrical impulses is shown at the beginning of Fight Club. This could have hinted towards the neurological illnesses that the narrator has and will face. The movie also used camera angles to help the audience experience what the characters in the movie were feeling. During the fight scenes, a lot of the time there was a bottom up view of the fight5ers. This happened especially when the narrator want barbaric on the blond man and beat him until he had sustained heavy injuries. This was to show the audience the position that the blond man was in, showing the true ferocity of the narrator. However, this isn't always the case. Other times throughout the movie camera angles seemed pretty neutral or just moved with the flow of the characters to provide a fluid viewing experience for the audience. During the end of the movie, the camera shot was used to show the vastness of the city being dismantled by Tyler's destruction. Fight Club also includes those strange up close and free moving, almost untethered shots where scenarios are shown such as when the narrators apartment is blown up or the 10 bombs that are scattered around the city. All of these shots together in one movie give the audience a unique perspective.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A review of Fight Club.
",,"Fight Club has many things going for it, when looking deep into the techniques used to relay the emotions and feelings desired. The one that stands out is the dim and sometimes pitch-black scenes that really put an ominous feeling over the scene. Another is the camera views chosen in this film. In many of the scenes there was a new placement for the camera to look at. Although there are many more film making techniques used throughout this film, these are the ones that really stood out when viewing the film.In order to give this film the right feel it only made sense to use a very dark and creepy lighting style. If this film had a light theme similar to something like a children's movie, it would have had a much different feel. And then the cinematographer would have not been able to relay the message that was intended. However, this film is not all dark. There is a good number of scenes in which a lighter theme is used. This is to give a very graphic and clear view of what is going on in these moments. This is most apparent in the scene in which the narrator is in his boss's office and is beating himself up. The lighting in this scene is such that you can see everything that is going on in vivid detail. Another example of this is the scene in which the members of project mayhem bring back Bob from their ""mission"" and everyone is arguing over what to do. Unlike most of the other chaotic scenes in this film the lighting of this scene is such that there is no question as to what has happened.In coordination with the lighting the camera angles and views are another key component to the successful portrayal of the desired theme. The use of the different types camera angles can add a lot of varied subconscious emotions. This allows for the cinematographer to relay these feelings while doing very little work. While this is the ideal scenario, it is not always that easy, which is why other methods exist, such as lighting and sound. Other subconscious notions that all work together. Some examples of scenes in which the camera angle added to the story telling affect include, most of the scenes that took place in the house. These camera movements and angles really make you feel like you are in a claustrophobic building. You also get the feeling of a lot of filth, which is amplified by how small the spaces feel. Another example of interesting angles are the ones used in the fight scenes. The camera was either up around head height, or pretty much on the floor. This was done to get really close up views to the people who were being beaten up on the floor. And to really show the gore and blood that was being flung everywhere in these fights.Over all these two techniques were both well utilized in order to relay the feeling and emotions desired by the director and the cinematographer. And to add to that they were used in almost aseamless way where it was just one flowing motion and it was sometimes difficult to be able to tell what techniques were being used over others. This is a testament to the talent of the talent of the director and cinematographer. To be able to envision these ideas before they were ever put onto a screen. As well as the editors and after effects people who can adjust all of these parameters after the whole film has been shot.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Consumerism in Film
",spoiler,"Fight club is a very interesting look at the the way we live our lives compared to how we want to and what the reality of our dreams could look like. The Narrator lives the quintessential ""American Dream"" a decently paying job with travel around the country and more material items than he knows what to do with. And when life turns down for him, his apartment blows up, he realizes he has nobody to turn to. This in itself would of been a travesty of life but as is revealed toward the end of the film, the Narrator did this to himself. I view this as the manifestation of the Narrator's distaste in his current life. He lives a life trapped in his own discomfort, going to cancer meetings and pretending to be dealing with real issues when in fact he is dealing with depression stemming from his hatred of his own affluence. Once he has to face this reality, by Marla Singer also feeding off the pain of others. Her character is more emotionally complex in that she lives in a crack apartment and steals for food. She doesn't have superficial problems with her life, she has real issues and things to have a reason for being upset or hating existing. Maybe her reason for false consolation is her inability to face real adversity. Just like how the Narrator can't face his life sucks and hates it. Fincher's use of framing throughout the film creating a feeling of claustrophobia, putting the viewer in the mental state of the Narrator. All the action is centrally focused with external characters rounding out the shots. The end shot of the credit buildings falling is the first example of an open frame. This connects emotionally to the Narrator for the first time allowing another human being to embrace him in a non violent or aggressive fashion. Fincher also used lighting on an emotional level throughout the film. Even during shots during the day time there was an aura of darkness around the Narrator, again the film didn't seem bright or with life until the final explosion shot as the building falling seemed to be acting as fireworks in celebration of his personal escape from his self made prison. Costuming of the characters was also brilliant. As the gaudy outfits of Tyler and Marla seemed to exemplify what a regular person would think would happen to anybody if they lived at a slot machine for 5 years and took a flight to New York City. The underlying message of the film however seems to be kind of fuzzy. It is very obviously anti consumerism and an attempt to show the furthest extent that a person can be pushed to when they live their life defined by what they own. However the film itself doesn't seem to be outside of this corporate influence. As Pepsi has a prominent presence on the screen, even featuring an actual Pepsi ad in front of the news report on the smiley face building. This could be seen as an active decision, seeing the irony in this and allowing it anyways. But I don't buy that. It seems that the main message is fogged down by the true reality of modern film. As much we want to believe they are free forms of creativity and free from foreign influence. They still need to be funded and still need to appeal to as many as possible. So as creative a movie Flight Club was, even its anti consumerism message cant escape the grasp of what has become big Hollywood controlling what gets made and what is inside these films.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Great Movie
",spoiler,"Fight Club is the kind of movie that tugs at your inner demons. It'll make you take a step back and really question the life you're living. It's a powerful film that really puts you in the place of crazed Tyler Durden. Director David Fincher chose to take the route of a film noir over a classical film, and the genius of this choice lives on in the legacy that is Fight Club. The lighting, the camera angles, and the story all blend together to become an instant classic. Edward Norton plays a character who is stuck in a cycle of depression and insomnia. After a doctor recommendation, he attends support groups to let go and help his insomnia. He eventually meets Tyler Durden, a soap salesmen who changes his life forever. From the very beginning of the movie, the film is dark, and low lit, there are very little scenes with bright lighting. The film-noir- esque film focuses on not showing too much, and keeping dark overtones to make the audience feel on edge or more intrigued in different cases. Especially during scenes where the fight club is actually taking place, everyone's faces are shrouded around the outside, while the lone spotlight in the middle signifies the only thing that matters to the members of fight club. The film follows many of the same standards found in a film-noir, such as the dark, abandon and unkempt home, the heavy focus on using violence to get what you desire, and the idea of having a following, who will do as you wish regardless of the request. The narrator and Tyler's home is a rundown house, filled with leaks, trash, and mold everywhere. It really shows how driven the pair are to be different, and stray away from societal norms, and how little they care for living how an average person lives. It really emphasizes how far gone they are from sanity, and how far they are willing to go to stand for what they believe in. The way the members of fight club are portrayed says a lot about them as well. In the beginning, everyone fights with no shoes, and no shirts. They are seen as barbaric, stripping down to their roots to do only as instinct tells them. By the end however, they are dressed in all black, and the organization has drastically changed. They have gone from an organization built on liberating themselves, to an organization built on liberating others. The way the characters are portrayed shows visually the change from self-liberation, to organized crime. The way the film is shot is very effective as well. Often times we find ourselves seeing things directly from the eyes of the narrator, or right up in the character's faces. This style of up close and personal filming helps the audience establish a personal connection with them. The goes hand in hand with the dark lighting as well. We see close up faces and minimal lighting, and it really brings out the raw emotion and dark senses in the characters. Overall, Fight Club was a great movie, the plot was fantastic, and the twist caught me completely off guard. It was exciting to watch and I found myself constantly wondering where the story was going and wondering what was happening, until the ending completely reels you in. The dark lighting and abstract film angles emphasize the true nature of the Narrators mind. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves dark and brutal films with great and unexpected twists.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club's Cinematography
",spoiler,"Fight Club, a confrontational, fierce, often ruthless parody is a mental thriller that follows the life of two apparent antagonists which almost fully echoes the narrative of the respectable Dr. Jekyll and the formidable Mr. Hyde, being that they are the same person, David Fincher externalizes an alter ego in a unique filmmaking style. The setup of the scenes also accommodated the emotions of the actors. Fight Club employs numerous styles of lighting that are used throughout the film depending on the mood and emotions felt at the time. By using low-key lighting, the scenes that are filmed in the basement emphasize the vibe that's felt in the room. This is also used when Tyler is alone, or Tyler and Jack together to portray an overall darkness, by creating higher saturation, a higher contrast, and heavier shadows. This helps characterize Tyler as highly masculine and having a perilous personality. Conversely, with Jack, we noticed the lighting is more high-key, often with low contrast and little to no shadows. This helps describe the narrator's consumeristic personality and mundane life. However, it is evident that Finch chose to utilize the tone and mood of low-key lighting more throughout the film, while both types of lighting appeared throughout. Nonetheless, on the off chance that the unmistakable difference in lighting was not used, the emotional distinction amongst Tyler and Jack's identities would not have been as apparent. Despite the fact that it is an extremely stylized approach, the lighting of the film, still somewhat seems sensible. The locations chosen accompanied their own inherent lightning. Examples include streetlights for backlighting, and fluorescents, which illuminated an off-color hue, that was cold and suits the tone. This is what created the realistic effect of the differentiating miss en scène used amongst character's and settings, and emerged as clues for the narrator's different identities. The placement and angle of the camera also played a critical role in the cinematography and guided the perception of the audience. The filmmaker chose to shoot most of the scenes in which the actors in close proximity of each other. This includes shots that were intimate, personal, and social. Fincher also utilizes camera angles to differentiate the contrasting personalities. When Tyler and the members of fight club are in the basement, Tyler is in the middle of a low angle shot. This type of camera angle is used to show us that he is the authoritative member in which everyone admires. Another scene in which Tyler, with his abettors behind him, is in a close-up after they jump an official. This suggests power and dominance over the audience while allowing us to feel how threatened and scared the official must be. Another brilliant example of the cinematography and editing coming intertwined with each other was when jack brutally beats up a member during a fight. Again, this was another low angle shot chosen by the filmmakers. The placement of the camera forces us to look upwards at him, all the while making him seem more capable and deliberating. The filmmakers chose this angle to make the viewer cringe at this intense moment. We also notice that the camera is often stationary during many of the scenes in the first half of the film. But as we go on, the camera starts to position itself as a first-person view of the character. This is another clue given to us that Tyler and Jack are the same person. David Fincher chose these various camera angles, lighting, and colors as a technique to deliver the audience clues, crucial information, and hidden motives throughout the film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A story about an emotionless man who changes his life after meeting a man named Tyler and a woman named Marla
",spoiler,"Fight Club ReviewFight Club is a bizarre film. It has a weird sense of pacing, the plot is extremely lucid and seemly has no overarching goal, the main character is extremely off-putting and doesn't even have a name, and many other elements of the film are strangely put together. Fight Club is an extremely experimental film that tries to break a majority of the set-rules of cinema, but does this leave it a shallow stylistic mess? Absolutely not! Despite its very odd presentation Fight Club is an extremely brilliant film, that holds a tremendous amount of depth.Fight Club is a black-noir film, which means the story is narrated from the point of view of the main character. Being a black-noir film is also carries a few noir flavored troupes, being that the movie has a mysterious atmosphere, contains many twists and turns, depicts a cynical view of the modern world, and of course contains a whole lot of gritty violence and sex! What I found funny about this film is how it can shift from being dark and violent, to hilariously immature, to deep and intellectual. I love these types of juxtapositions sense they do a great job of keeping the audience off kilter. An aspect I love about Fight Club is the excessive amount of theming and symbolism used. Almost every object, location, or person represents an important aspect of the character or of an overall theme. (Spoiler warning!) For example when the main characters fancy apartment is a representation of his personality. The apartment has all of the essential things for living and looks very presentable, but it has nothing with sentimental value and looks as if no one has even been living there. The main character focuses on being presentable and having the appearance of a whole person, but in reality lacks substance and emotional attachments. This metaphor is pushed further when the main characters house is burned down and he describes seeing his destroyed fridge as ""embarrassing, fridge full of condiments and with no food"". This further represents the idea that main character is the same way, full of ornamentation and with no substance. (Spoiler end). Personally I'm a sucker for clever symbolism and theming as it adds a deeper meaning to the actions of each character and of each scene. I wouldn't say it's any substitute for a good plot, but it definitely adds to the overall quality of the film, especially when it's done as subtle as this film. The cinematography of this film is spot on! Each scene's lighting and camera angle is manipulated in such a way that it forces the viewer to feel a plethora of emotions. Many fight scenes brilliantly use the lighting to only show the highlights of the characters bodies, and keeps their faces in the dark. This is done to intensify each blow that dealt between fighters and to help portray just how gruesome it is. Many scenes are filmed indoors and are set-up with a very claustrophobic feeling. This is to heightened the theme of entrapment that a majority of the characters feel within their lives. There are many other cinematography ticks used throughout the film, some being extremely connected to the films major plot twist. To catch some of these subtle foreshadows sprinkled throughout the film, I highly suggest watching the film multiple times to try. The last thing to talk about is the plot. I've been avoiding touching this since this film is best watched with as little information as possible. The key things I want to address is despite the film seemingly like it has little main goal or plot, there is a rather hidden main point of the film. The film overall is a story about a man who meets a man named Tyler and a woman named Marla, and it shows how the friendships he made with the two ultimately push the main character to change his life, for better or for worse. The film breaks a lot of rules about narrative progression but it still feels like a solid and well thought out story that's definitely worth a watch!Overall Fight Club is a fantastic story with a lot of depth and I definitely recommend it to those who enjoy thrillers, and mysteries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Such a Classic
",spoiler,"This film although quite a mental thriller sides with a sense of classical cinema. This movie falls between realism and an avant-garde. Many of the events taken play may have happened before as well as can happen in the future. The final scene does get a little extreme but theoretically an act of terrorism similar to that could occur. Due to the film being narrated by a character, there is more freedom for the story to be twisted around a bit. Everything can be twisted due to complexity of an unstable mind, leading to a more artistic stance.The lighting in Fight Cub was minimal, casting shadows around every corner. Although the lighting set the mood for the movie, it was used realistically. Nothing was un-natural, some of which I have experienced myself. Turning off the power to the house while it rained created a sense of realism. I'm not saying everyone does that, but when it comes to living in a house that is falling apart and leaking, it is something that should be taken care of. The basement scenes were great when it came to the lighting, there was little to none. It lowered our senses, making it more difficult to track what is going one, and get lost in the pure violence that was going on between two people. One film that comes to mind, using light as an expression of feeling is Limitless. Every time the main character takes a performance enhancing drug, the lighting around the world changes. Everything is more vibrant and energizing and contrast was enhanced to give the viewer a chance to walk in the main character's shoes.Now let's talk about the shots. Fight Club covers all of the classic types of shots, from static to full motion this film seams it all together flawlessly. Close up shots made the fights personal, giving the viewer a chance to be in the shoes of the narrator. Being this close, raises the heart rate, nothing matters but this fight. The viewer is forced to watch the violence and there is no chance of getting out, just like the narrator taking punches. Extreme long shots were used when setting the scene. Displaying the whole back of the bar and the parking lot took the minimized the violence. It gave the viewer a chance to watch it from afar. The fight is meaningless and the viewer is no longer attached to it. It doesn't affect anyone but Tyler and the Narrator. This distance adds a sense of humor to lighten the mood. When the random guys come out of the back of the bar, the viewer sees what any onlooker sees, a fight between two people over an important reason. This adds a sense of humor to lighten the mood. The viewer knows they are beating each other up for fun, but the other guys see it as a serious fight between two drunks that should be broken up.The production design crew did a fantastic job creating the apartment for the narrator. Filing it up with furniture to make it look similar to an Ikea magazine. This is a major part for setting up the story, showing how materialistic the narrator is. Also a slight foreshadowing with the yin and yang table. As the narrator transforms, he becomes less materialistic, he loses a sense of what it's like to own nice things, and does not miss it. He even points out that after a month of no television, he almost forgot it existed. The costume design department did a nice job on the narrator's work attire. Starting off well dressed with a tie and clean pressed shirt and eventually changing to an unbuttoned coffee and blood stained shirt. I noticed Tyler's shirt at the end was very unusual looking. After doing some research I learned that the shirt he wore was covered in pornographic magazine covers. The rating association made sure to tone down the movie to receive its R rating, but they completely missed the nude images portrayed on the shirt. That shirt really resembled what Tyler stood for.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" very good movie 8 out of 10
",spoiler,"In David Fincher's 1999 Fight Club Edward Norton's character is a depressed insomniac that is stuck in his boring life but looking for an escape. In an attempt to find his escape he attends support groups, until Marla Singer(Helena Bonham Carter) starts to do the same thing that he is doing. When he see's this he is distraught and doesn't know what to do until he finds Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden. Soon after they move in together and begin fight club, a club for men to get together to relieve there aggression and problems. The club quickly develops in to something very different; They start vandalizing around the city as a means to topple the country's social structure, and fight club becomes project Mayhem. As Edward Norton's Tyler Durden gain's knowledge of the larger plan he begins to hunt down Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden to stop all of this, but he soon realizes that Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden is a figment of his imagination and he is the one that caused all of this. The film ends with Edward Norton's Tyler Durden watching buildings collapse and the social structure topple as he wanted. Although film noir is not a style that has a happy ending we see many elements of film noir through out Fight Club. So is this a film noir or just a film with many film noir elements. Film noir has many key elements to it such as lighting flash backs and voice overs. It also has many key story elements such as loss, nostalgia, lack of priorities. Through out the film we see many of the elements that go into a film noir such as lighting. Lighting has a key importance in this film, it is very expressive and high key used to show the modes of the scenes. The lighting plays a huge role in the scenes where fight club is held in the basement of the bar. The fight scenes are very dark and mysterious only having enough light to show what is happening. When light is put on someones face only half of their face can be seen, this adds to the idea that you are not yourself when your in fight club; By only showing half a face you do not show someone's entire identity but only part of it. Another way lighting is used is in showing dominance in the fights. The scene in which Edward Norton's Tyler Durden is on top of one of the members and punching his head in to the ground we see that his face is light from the bottom this is showing dominance over his opponent. This scene is also interesting because of the camera angle. In this scene a low camera angle is used to show Edward Norton's Tyler Durden's dominance over the other fighter. The camera along with the lighting give him a different type of dominance and power almost making him look sinister. These are two prime examples of very stylized lighting that is used in the film. On top of the fight scenes being dark and mysterious the entire moving tends to be quite dark with only few scenes with actual full lighting. The majority of the light seen through out the film tends to be very dim with the backgrounds tending to be very dark. Other key elements such as flash backs and voice overs are also seen through out the film. Flash backs are a big piece to this film, the entire film is a flash back. In the beginning of the film we see Edward Norton's Tyler Durden tied up and being held by Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden; The film is one large flash back of how he got in to that position. Along with Flash backs you will see voice overs, those two go hand in hand. These are two big elements of film noir and they are seen through the entire movie not just parts of it. Other than the elements of film noir the muse en scene in fight club also stood out. Through out the entire film Edward Norton's and Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden both were in the center of the frame. This showing that they are the center of attention and are the most important characters through out the film. This also shows their dominance over other characters throughout the film being in the center of the screen. Another thing that happens through out the film is that when Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are in the same frame Edward Norton is in the center and Brad Pitt is off to the side a little. This has to do with the plot and how they are related. Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden is made up by the imagination of Edward Norton's character so it makes sense that Edward Norton is in the center and Brad Pitt is off to the side a little. Is this a film noir or just a film with film noir elements; This is a film noir, there are a multitude of film noir elements and themes. So this is a film noir that happens to have a happy ending.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club follows the dive into insanity of a man trying to escape his own anarchy.
",spoiler,"Fight Club follows the dive into insanity of a man trying to escape his own anarchy.Even in the daylight this film manages to create darkness. The whole film consists of dimly lit, menacing scenes portraying the unknown as the narrator, Jack, loses his sense of reality. Actions of his alter-self, Tyler, are completely unpredictable and often unmemorable to him. His psychological state is constantly re-enforced by the mystery set forth by the film's cinematic elements.The major theme of the unknown that we see in this film aligns with the conventions of a typical film noir. Their rundown home, the violence of their ""Fight Club"", and the eventual creation of a cult-like ""army"" all appeal to the theme of emphasizing the darker aspects of human condition. Outside of the cinematic elements, the role of a femme fatale is fulfilled by Marla. Introduced as an annoyance to Jack, she eventually becomes the only piece of reality he has left - aiding him in returning to reality by the end of the film. Though she was more known to his alter-self, ultimately his decisions throughout the film are driven by his interest in her.Emphasizing character emotions, this film doesn't consist of many long shots. In the fight scenes, close and medium shots allow us to associate ourselves with the emotions of the characters as their aggression erupts in front of our eyes. Within these shots, the limited lighting is directed onto the bodies of the characters without reaching their faces, de-personalizing them to us as they have done to each other. This focused lighting shows that their club acts as another world to them, their realities temporarily forgotten. Throughout most of the film shots are done in a realistic style. It is only in the end, after Jack's reality has become apparent to him, that the film switches to a formalistic style. This style was most prominently featured in Jack and Tyler's fight scene as Tyler's power is exaggerated.Production design is a major element of this film. Within the fight scenes the shirtless costumes are used to portray the characters as the vicious animals they have become. Outside of the ""Fight Club"", the next primary usage of costume is seen when Tyler begins building his ""army"". The all-black costumes his followers are made to wear reflect the attributes of the mindless cult that he is running. Particular to the main characters, Jack and Tyler, their costumes seem to contrast with each other. Jack is mostly seen wearing plain, casual clothes while Tyler wears more vibrant, exotic outfits. This contrast is used to symbolize the separate personalities - good and evil - of the single person they are.Another evident element of the production design was the claustrophobic urban setting. This was employed to create the darkness necessary in portraying the film noir theme of the unknown. Tyler's rundown home in an abandoned district symbolizes the characters' alienation from society. It re-iterates the idea of the new society they have created for themselves, living by their own rules. Within that home, the disgusting conditions they subject themselves to represent their loss of sanity and the overall anarchy their world is evolving into.Combined, these elements allow the audience to associate with the characters and feel the distancing from reality that the characters themselves are experiencing. With having the ability to to experience the plot rather than just witness it, I consider this to be an excellent film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club
",,"When I first heard the name of the movie (Fight Club) I thought ""Oh so it's basically just guys fighting the whole time. Like main character is probably a boxer or a fighter or something. It's not really worth watching."" I didn't think it was a kind of movie that I would enjoy. But, Fight Club is not just a movie where guys beat each other up because they have nothing else to do. On the contrary, the movie has really clear statements about the society that we live in. During the last week of school of my junior year of high school, we would watch a different movie everyday because we didn't have class. One of the movies we watched during that week was Fight Club and I think I was the least excited person in the class about watching that movie. However, throughout the movie, I had a great time. I absolutely loved the movie and it's definitely one of my favorite movies. It was definitely not what I thought it was going to be. I liked everything about it, it was great until the end. I've watched that movie multiple times and I still watch it without getting bored. I can watch it again and again and it will never get old or boring. Fight Club is a really unique movie. It's intense, aggressive, deep, dark and maybe disturbing for others. However, all those things made the movie a lot better and in my opinion more successful. The movie was brilliant, in my opinion, from the script, the lighting, the music, cast choice, to the acting. I'm not a person who knows a lot of thing about movies, or lighting, or settings of movies but from what I know everything was brilliant in this movie. The lighting throughout the movie, in different scenes matched perfectly. It helped the person who was watching it understand the scene or the seriousness of it better. The screenplay was definitely perfect according to what I think and I think casting couldn't have been better. The cinematography, pacing, twists, transitions are excellent. I've seen a lot of movies of Brad Pitt and Edward Norton and I can say that Fight Club produced their best performance. I thought they were the best fit for the characters. The movie begins with a narration from a person who we know as ""narrator."" It goes on by showing how he lives his life basically. What he does at work, at home, etc. It helps the viewer to get to know the narrator and this happens throughout the movie. Norton plays the narrator (we are never given his name). Starting from the beginning of the movie, he tries to find something that will change his average life. He is living this boring, dead-end life. He is trying to find meaning in his little life. Tyler and Marla help the narrator and change the narrator's life. Tyler is almost everything that the narrator wants to be. He is spontaneous, does whatever he wants, etc. These two personalities go well until they start to kind of destroy each other. And the love triangle that came with Marla makes things more complicated than it already is. When I watch a movie, the first thing I really want to know is how the movie is going to end because the filmmakers make either something big or something small for the end. I am not going to tell the ending because I do not want to spoil it for anyone but the ending was definitely amazing just like the rest of the movie.I would definitely recommend this movie to everyone. It is an amazing movie. I will never get bored of watching Fight Club. It should be on everyone's list of movies that they should watch.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club Review
",spoiler,"Fight Club is one of those movies where each time you rewatch it, you realize more and more things that you did not pick up on the previous rerun. When you watch Fight Club, you might think that it is simply about members of a club that all they do is fight one another. When really it is a much deeper and dramatic story than it seems.The story follows an unnamed man played by Edward Norton and narrates the entire movie. The narrator lives a boring life where he has a boring job that is meaningless and doesn't care for. The narrator's life becomes meaningless to him and starts to fall into a depression which gives him insomnia. After many weeks of sleepless nights, the narrator visits his doctor to try and get help with his insomnia but is no help and suggests visiting support groups. After going to a few the narrator relies on them to vent so he can get sleep. When he notices a woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) starting to go to each support group as well he develops insomnia again. The narrator finds himself on an airplane for a business trip and meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). When the narrator returns home from the business trip he discovers that his condo was blown up, he decides to move in with Tyler in an abandoned house and also start a ""Fight Club"" in at a local bar. The purpose of the club was for men to get all their frustrations out about themselves, society, or anything by fighting one another. After some time Tyler decides to make the club members to start revolting against society by destroying all the popular consumer products and committing acts of terrorism known as Project Mayhem. Tyler disappears and the narrator is the one left in charge. He keeps running into people he knows from Fight Club and determines that he is Tyler. The movie ends with the narrator and Marla at the top of a building watching the financial buildings crumble to the ground due to Project Mayhem's plans.In Fight Club, David Fincher uses multiple camera angles to make the audience feel a certain way at different times. In the fighting scenes in the bar, the cinematographer uses low angle shots whenever Tyler speaks showing that he is the one in charge. The use of close up shots of the bloodied and beaten faces of club members makes the audience react in the way Fincher intended you to. The cinematographer also filmed the fight scenes in a way which makes the viewer feel like they are actually in the fight. The camera bops back and forth, falls down with the fighters, and shows the nasty and grotesque injuries up close and personal to make you feel like you are the one beating someone up. Lighting is a major role in this film as well. Fincher uses expressional lighting a lot throughout the film. In the scenes in the basement of Lou's Tavern, there is only a few lights hanging from the ceiling to make the scene feel more dark and mysterious. The use of expressional and low lighting throughout the film makes Fight Club have more classic noir characteristics with a modern twist of the time.Not knowing that the narrator was Tyler until finding out towards the end of the film added to the film. It made you think differently of the narrator and left you wanting to find out more about Tyler just like the narrator is trying to do. Each time I rewatch Fight Club I still find myself learning more and more about the narrator and Tyler. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt did an amazing job in this film and the attitude and characteristics they have added to the feel of the film.""His name was Robert Paulson.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club Film Analysis
",spoiler,"One of the most noticeable elements that was employed in the film Fight Club was the use of production design. The entire film had a dark feel to it, and the production design was composed in such a way that the darkness of the film progressed throughout its length. In the beginning of the film, the costume and set were selected in a way that seemed realistic, as though to appeal to our sense of connection to the character in the film. Despite this, the lighting, and of course the narration from the main character led us to notice something was clearly amiss. The main character was certainly not the average person.After having watched the film, one subtle, yet extremely powerful instance of foreshadowing happens when the main character narrates: ""If you wake up in a different time, in a different place, could you wake up as a different person?"" The camera then pans to centre the motion around Tyler, as if to show that maybe the main character could wake up as Tyler. The irony of this is, of course, that the main character really does wake up as Tyler, but the element is subtle because, at this point in the film, the viewer has yet to be formally exposed to Tyler.Throughout the film, Tyler's and the main character's are always in contrast. Through his costume, Tyler is portrayed as laid back, care- free, and dare I say it, cool. On the other hand, the main character generally tries to dress more formally, depending on the occasion. However, as the film progresses, the main character seems to become increasingly like Tyler. The main character shows up to work in tattered clothes, a sharp contrast to the suit and tie that he always wore for the first 40 or so minutes of the film. It gets to the point where the only difference in Tyler and the main character's outfit is an undone bow-tie, seen in the scene where they coerce the mayor. The bond that the main character feels toward Tyler and his ideas quickly dissipates when Bob is killed, and their outfits return to being highly contrasting, to show that the main character is no longer on Tyler's 'side'.After the main character, and the audience, realise that he is really Tyler Durden, the film switches between realistic and formalistic shots. When the main character is getting beat up by Tyler in the garage, the main action is more formalistic, as it is known that what we are seeing is just happening in the main character's head. However, the camera frequently switches to security cameras, which is fitting being that they are in a car garage. This different photography shows what is happening in the 'real world' as it shows the main character just throwing himself around, and causing severe injury to himself in the process. By adding this to the film, some context is brought into how the main character could have actually believed that Tyler was a separate person. His mind is so warped, that he can seriously injure himself just from his mind playing tricks on him. Despite the physical location of the shots being completely different (one being in the garage, and the other in the security room) the film is edited so the transition is seamless and continuity is preserved completely. This makes the transition between the formalistic and realistic shots fluid with the action and not seem jarring or out of place. The music in this scene also assists the director in getting his point across. The music is like what would be played in a horror film, with high- pitched, fast violins, and strange sounds. This helps to build an almost nightmarish atmosphere in the film as it seems like what the main character is experiencing is something most people only ever face in a bad dream. He is utterly helpless to the wrath of Tyler and the thrilling music makes the audience feel some of the terror that the main character is feeling in this scene.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Welcome to Fight Club!
",spoiler,"""Fight Club"" (1999) Review By Christopher Tran""Welcome to Fight Club. The first rule of Fight Club is: you do not talk about Fight Club. The second rule of Fight Club is: you DO NOT talk about Fight Club!"" At least that's what Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, exclaimed when he first established the so-called ""club"" in the basement of a bar. Never could he have imagined such a simple rule could lead to the expansion of the club to simply multiply overnight. He along with the Narrator, played by Edward Norton, create a dynamic duo that could influence the lives of many in the film which eventually led to the many emotional and intense scenes. Originally a novel published by Chuck Palahniuk in 1996, the book would become a movie that would intrigue the thoughts of others into believing such a reality could exist in the U.S. at the time. While the time period for the film isn't specifically stated, it can be deduced to take place around the mid-90s. Multiple events throughout the film from explosions, riots, vandalism, to multiple personalities and various psychological disorders, make the film seem so realistic yet impossible for society at the time. The films realism approach with these multiple chaotic events gives it the dark noir vibe that most of David Fincher's, the director for this film, films take and also the reason he receives so much criticism from those who watch his films. This ""dark noir"" is depicted with multiple sexual scenes as well as vandalism and malicious activities centered around a crime driven film. The amount of suspense from the plot as well as the characters mixed personalities creates such an amazing film.Going to the characters, just by comparison the Narrator and Tyler Durden are strong opposites. Yet, they somehow create a bond that allows them to create their own society. A society where one looks up to the other, wanting to be like him, almost like the average movie duo where one is obedient to the other while the other has the more vocal personnel. What makes this film great is how the interactions between these two characters evolve, deconstructs and soon implodes under the realization of the Narrator and his dual personality is what creates the amount of tension evident in the film. The role of Marla Singer in the plot also has its impacts. An obstacle to the narrator becomes the romantic and sexual motivations for Tyler Durden's temporary relief. Despite what a nuisance she appears to be to the narrator by being the one mental block that interrupted his support group relief, she appears to be the main reason for the narrator to keep his mind straight especially during the time when he knows she would be in grave danger. Her psychological problems, as well as drug abuse, in the beginning, were there mainly to express the darkness of the crime central film and how some people at the time experienced some problems that she had to endure or bestowed upon herself.Diving into this film seems great, plot and all. A story that revolves around chaos, destruction, and conflict. A psychological game that plays not only with the viewers of the film but also with the other characters in the film that play along with the ""game"" with the addition of the double personalities. A love triangle that appears strange yet somehow begins to make more sense as the film plays out. And most of all the fight club that started it all, acting as both the psychotherapy and the personality development the story needed. This movie has it all, a must see!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Film elements used In Fight Club
",spoiler,"Fight Club was used many aspects of filming in order to give the film a real life feel with you actually feeling like you were there with the characters. David Fincher was able to accomplish this while using lighting, camera movement and camera angles as well as cinematography, using closed shots and the unknown element of Tyler's character. Without these elements of filming the audience would not have been as attached or felt like they were there and the film would not be nearly as popular as it was and still is today Lighting was carefully chosen throughout the entirety of the film to give a darker feel to the shots. Most scenes were located in darker locations as well as taken after dark to help give this feel to the film. The darker lighting made it easier for the viewer to make them feel like they were there with Tyler and the Narrator. Also the lighting in the basement during the fights was focused on the characters actually fighting while the background of the people watching and rest of the room remained darker to draw your eyes to the fight itself rather than drifting off. The movement of the camera and the angles of the camera shot during Fight Club also added an aspect to the film. During the fights the camera was constantly switching from moving like you were fighting the guy across the ring, then switching make it seem like someone was on top of you punching you in the face, to the reactions and cheering of the audience. All of these camera angles and movements like the camera shooting down on a fighter on the ground or shooting across the ring and the angle focused on the faces being emphasised added to the real life feel of the film. On top of this cinephotography was used to add a real life feel in the film and to capture the emotions of the characters. The cinematographer choose to use close ups for many of the scenes to accomplish this. These close up shots were able to give you an up close look on the reactions and feelings of the characters. Also the closeups were used to make it feel like you were standing in front of the character being filmed and experiencing their actions first hand. The director also used closed shots in the film because David Fincher decided to use the constant movement of the camera. Not needing everything in the shot or not seeing everything that was going on at any given time allowed the director to show only what he wanted you to see. This then allowed him to make you feel a certain way whether that be by showing just Bob dead on the kitchen table, or focussing on someone beat up after a fight with blood dripping down their face rather than showing just the room as a whole. Having the narrator not know that he was also Tyler until the end of the film rather than using being told this when Tyler's character was introduced also added an element to the film. This made you want to know more about Tyler's character and figure out where he always is and figure out she shadowy element about him. This element draws you in and makes you feel like you're joining the narrator's search for Tyler's character.Fight Club became such a popular movie because of the way it was chosen to be filmed. The lighting, movement and cinematography were the main elements that pushed towards this real life feeling film in which you felt like you were there as well as making you want to figure the mysteries of Tyler. David Fincher was the reason that this film became as big of a hit as it is today and would not have been as powerful if another director filmed it in a different way.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club Review
",spoiler,"Brad Pitt has done a tremendous amount of films, and a lot of them are very well known. One of his better-known films is Fight Club, directed by David Fincher, starring both Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. This film starts off quite slow, but he moment that Edward Norton's character, the Narrator, meets Brad Pitts character, Tyler Durden, the film picks up relatively quickly. The tempo and tone of the movie change after their first interaction with each other. The tone of the film beings to become somewhat dark. This tone is enhanced through the type of lighting that David Fincher uses throughout the film. As the film progresses, you rarely see any true natural lighting which results in the lighting being very dark and dim. This helps enhance the films tone, but also helps in telling a deeper meaning for the character and story. This decision to have the lighting like this in regard to the characters and the story works well in the way that David Fincher uses it. The Narrator's life is an unpleasant one, and as the story progresses it becomes darker, just like the lighting style that David Fincher uses. David Fincher also uses the concept of colors to help enhance certain points of the film, which works very well in this film. The major color concept that he uses is the outfit color differentiation between Tyler Durden and the Narrator. The outfits that Tyler Durden wears are very vibrant and colorful whereas the Narrator's outfits are very bland, and the colors are very boring and solid. The Narrator will wear black and white, and Tyler will wear an eye popping red or yellow. This differentiation that David Fincher used is key to the story line of the film. It shows the personality of both characters and how much they oppose each other. Tyler is a lot more outgoing and crazy, whereas the Narrator is more conserved and cautious. Another key element that David Fincher incorporates in the film that works really well is his ability to take a location in the film and basically make that location its own character. The two main locations that David Fincher creates are the house that Tyler and the Narrator live in and the basement where Fight Club actually takes place. These two locations are integral to the characters and the story line development. The house shows the turn of the narrator's life going downhill. This house though would become the focal point of Project Mayhem which shows the progression of the story, characters, and fight club itself. The basement where fight club takes place is also integral in that it shows where everything started and that it stays there throughout the whole film never changing. The film does use a variety of camera angles, some for the better while others are not. The camera angle used for the first fight between Tyler and the Narrator is done well in being a wide shot and zoomed out so you can see both of the characters. The camera angles used during the fight scenes I felt weren't great. I felt sometimes they were too close to the fighters which didn't allow me to visually see the fight as well. When David Fincher used a birds eye view of the fights I felt they were well done. Also the camera style he used when the scene zoomed a ridiculous amount, for example the scene explaining how the Narrators apartment exploded, I feel was a good touch due to its ability to show the true detail behind something. My thoughts overall on the film is that the film is very well made and the story line is very well progressed throughout the film. I felt the film though was dragged on and slow at certain points which caused me to lose interest at certain points. I enjoyed the movie and its story line. I also enjoyed the cinematography of the film and how the film is directed. I will not discuss the ending of the film to avoid spoilers for anyone, but I personally did not enjoy the ending. I felt that the ending was a risky move, and I feel that it was well done and it paid off. I just feel that it could of gone a different route and had been better. Overall I would give the film an 8/10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Modern Take on the Film Noir
",spoiler,"Fight Club is one of those movies that has to be watched several times to see all of the small allusions to the twist that comes at the end of the second act of the movie. While I have only seen the movie once so far, I think I will make it my mission at some in the future to find more of these small hints left by the director David Fincher. I had caught a few after the plot twist was revealed by remembering key details, but I feel there are more that I have missed.Fight Club revolves around an unnamed narrator played by Edward Norton whose insomnia is affecting his life tremendously, to the point that he goes to different random support groups just to cry it out and get some much-needed sleep. However, after a woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) starts going to the support groups too, the narrator is unable to get the sleep he needs again, to which point he meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on an airplane. After the narrator's condo is blown up, he moves in with Tyler, eventually starting a ""Fight Club"" in the basement of a local bar where men emasculated by modern society can vent through beating each other up. After a while, the Club starts to commit acts of vandalism against capitalist and materialistic objects throughout the city. Eventually, the Club is taken over by Tyler, who turns it into Project Mayhem, which the narrator does not approve of. Tyler disappears, leading the narrator to follow him around the world where he keeps bumping into people part of Fight Club/Project Mayhem, where he realizes he is Tyler Durden, an alter ego created when he falls asleep from insomnia. Trying to stop ""Tyler,"" who is going to blow up all of the financial institutions in the city, the narrator is unsuccessful and the movie ends with Marla (who plays a minor role as ""Tyler's"" love interest) and the narrator, now Tyler watching the explosions of the skyscrapers from a construction site. One of the most interesting aspects about Fight Club is its relationship to much older ""film noirs"" of the 1940s. The lighting in the movie is an obvious example, with most of the movie in a high contrast state of the bright characters against a dark background. Most of the film takes place at night or indoors with minimal lighting coming from natural sources, the film is very expressionist in this regard. Fincher wants us, the audience, to see how the light looks, the contrasts, the rich blacks and grays, the muted colors of most of the cast, except for Tyler. The film is like this for the entire film, a dark, seedy underworld only exposed once the sun goes down and the artificial lighting humanity has created turns on. Shadows are engulfing, threatening to steal some of the characters from the scenes, disappearing from the film. Colors stand out in the film, Tyler's flamboyant clothing sticking out the most in the frame, almost popping out of the otherwise dark and muted movie. Every scene without Tyler is much drabber, the narrator's work is a good example of this, the extreme amount of white, gray, and brown in these scenes show how boring and mundane the narrator's life is without Tyler, the man who keeps the narrator entertained and on his toes. Another aspect of Fight Club, also connected to film noirs is the anti-materialistic view the film has, along with the air of mystery connected to Tyler and Project Mayhem. Throughout the second and third acts, Fight Club/Project Mayhem has a very clear anti- materialist and capitalist stance, showing continued vandalism against expensive neighborhoods, billboards, store displays, commercial art, chain stores and restaurants, and financial institutions. The film ends with the destruction of several credit card and banking companies to drive this stance home. Film noirs of the 40's also took this stance most of the time, the victims and perpetrators almost always rich, trying to become rich, powerful, trying to become powerful, married, cheated, jealous, or some combination thereof. The acts of violence in those films always had some ulterior or revenge motive, they were not random. The detectives or protagonists of these films were disillusioned by these problems, immune to the trials and tribulations of the cases they were working. Additionally, the mystery aspect of both also is important to both Fight Club and film noirs. Fight Club's mystery is almost hidden from the audience until the end of the second act when Tyler disappears, the fact their is a mystery at all is not totally apparent, but there is one, with a multitude of clues along the way that lead to that conclusion. Film noirs also have mysteries, but they are usually much more straightforward and obvious in existence, most film noirs, if not all, are crime-based, the mystery of ""whodunnit"" the driving force behind the plot. Fight Club and film noirs are very similar movie types, with Fight Club being a more modern film noir.Fight Club's mystery may not be apparent for a lot of the film, but when the movie is rewatched, a lot of elements early on clue into what the solution to the mystery is. Fight Club, a modern- day film noir brings the decades-old genre to a new generation of moviegoers, exposing them to the lighting style and ideas that the original film noirs had, with a more modern message and style.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

And it all collapses under the pressure of two rebels, to feel alive, awakened from their lethargy everyday, feeling the power in their hands to direct the course history.Intrigue, chaos and soap — to watch it all with such gusto was not be possible without the brilliant tandem of brad Pitt and Edward Norton, who played some of his best roles in his career.

" Get ready for a knock out film review of Fight Club, a classic 1999 drama film.
",spoiler,"Fight Club Review 1999 Drama Film By Elizabeth GreseWelcome to Fight Club! A dramatic expression of escape created by a man whose reasons for living was nothing short of pathetic. Correction: created by two men. Meet our nameless narrator played by Edward Norton; a man monotonously living his life clouded by his insomniac state. We are introduced to the second main character, Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt. The third main character, Marla Singer played by Helena Bonham Carter, was a constant in the film – although is portrayed as a lunatic. The dynamic of the duo started fight club and broke the monotonous state of the young man. As fight club progressed, what was a secluded expression of emotions morphed into schemes far more violent than intended. The progression of the film starts to reveal uncertainties of what is perceived as the plot. Plot twist and nothing is as it seems. When defined, film noir is the term for crime drama that emphasize particularly on cynical attitudes and sexual motivations. The definition of film noir basically sums up Fight Club. Having never seen the movie previously, my idea of the plot consisted of bloody battles. As I watched the beginning of the movie, I was so sure of myself that I had the plot right. I was shocked when the plot thickened with the use of film noir- the relationship with Marla (sexual motivations) and the creation of the fight club followers (crime and cynical attitudes.) The intricacy of the films in terms of the plot and layers of madness is none-the-less incredible. Fight Club exceeds pre- conceived expectations. In addition, when re-watching the movie, subtle clever hints tell the peak plot even in the first few scenes. I would urge new watchers and ultra Fight Club fans to take a second look at the filmmaker's placements of people, places, and things. The fight scenes in the basement created the feeling of grimy, pain and freedom. These feelings were portrayed during the film by the narrator as well. The lighting has a major play in how these feelings are presented. The dim lighting and semi-spot light on the two fighters creates the focus point. As the importance of the fight scenes are the two men fighting not the spectators around. During the basement fighting scene, Tyler Durden states the rules of fight club – one of which no shirt or shoes are allowed. This 'costuming' portrayed the plot point of the fight scenes being a freeing escape. The representation of no clothes often is referenced as a freeing feeling. ""The things you own end up owning you.""The intricacy of the character Tyler Durden and his perspective on the world created an underlying aspect to the plot. His opinions of meaningless material goods and corruption of consumer markets was the basis of Project Mayhem. The ending scenes, blowing up the credit card skyscrapers, used location as an example of his opinion on the corruption of material goods; more specifically, money. This film references what is often see as a modern day societal problem. The intricacy of the plot and portrayal of character Tyler Durden was an ingenious idea directed and produced. ""The first rule of fight club: don't talk about fight club.""One of the most iconic film quotes was from Fight Club. As a first- time viewer, I had noticed the subtle and prominent classic references to and by this film. If this isn't enough to spark your interest to watching this well-known film, then surely a shirtless roughed up Brad Pitt will certainly do.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Awesome
",spoiler,"Christopeher Nolan is a talented director. With batman begins,he created such a fantastic atmosphere that he brought batman character back in game. With the dark knight, he made not only a great second sequel, but also one of the best movies of the past 10 years. He mixed action, heroism, feeling, literature, colors so well that you feel kind of high when the movie ends. There is no doubt about it. But i see some people who don't mind to compare this movie with some old masterpieces and say the dark knight is the best movie so far.Haha, this is completely unacceptable.:)Let me clear this: If a movie can bring freshness to creativity, If a movie happens to change your insights, If a movie starts a new genre, gives away new techniques and styles, If a movie makes you understand your heart better; then I call that movie a masterpiece. As far as I see, The Dark Knight is far from it. But I still feel like I have to congratulate Christopher Nolan for making such a good film.

" Soap
",,"Never doubt the ability to provoke selfishness in one's mind. You should learn lesson about soap today. Fight Club is one movie that exactly caught the modern tension. Great performances, stunning visuals and a plot like nothing you've ever seen - one of the films of the year.Fight Club pulled you in, challenges your prejudices, rocks your world and leaves you laughing in the face of an abyss. It's alive, all right. It's also an uncompromising American classic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" good movie
",,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, it had me interested. A movie about guys who fight - it didn't seem to deep, but I thought it would provide entertainment. I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced. I should see this movie. I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD. I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it again. And again. And again.This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and stylistic. I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes away. Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern consumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).Norton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life. He needs something to change his life. Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away. Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching. As for it's ending, it doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away. One of the best movie endings I've seen. Even better if you're a Pixies fan.As for it being important, don't worry. You will be hearing about this movie. When 'A Clockwork Orange' came out, it was met with mixed reviews, deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic. These two movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books. If you haven't read either, get to it. Politicians will use this movie as a demonstration of careless and consequenceless violence in movies, and as a perfect example of what today's youth are being influenced by.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" You Do Not Talk About Fight Club
",,"The first (and second) rule of Fight Club is ""You do not talk about Fight Club"". So I won't divulge too much.The entire production is an achievement in of itself. Somewhat like The Usual Suspects (1995), there are some twists and surprises. The editing, cinematography, production design, sound, etc. all contribute to the effect, which is quite difficult to do. To give just enough in the first viewing, but the second viewing reveals all. However, to me, the whole thing feels empty. The film gives a lot of advice about life, but never really says much. Yes, there's a whole entire level below the visual and audio level revealing a hidden satire, complete with subliminal messages, but, to me, it just does not have substance. No character development, no theme, no significant plot. It really just comes down to one element. Fight Club is, by far, not my favorite film, but I give credit where credit is due. Fincher's primary goal was that when the movie was over, to at least have the viewer think about what they just saw. Most likely, for every viewer that has seen this movie, Fincher achieved his goal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" The first rule of fight club
",spoiler,"...is that you do not talk about fight club. Looks like every one of us on this site has broken that rule. Oh, well, Brad Pitt doesn't exist to beat us up anyway. I just finished re-watching the film, so now I've seen it twice and I must say, I really liked it the first time I saw it (when I was 14 years old), but now I don't like it quite as much. For one, I don't think it's as great a movie as all the excitement from that twist will have people believe. Sure, it's a great twist because it's not like something anyone would readily think up. For example, in ""The Usual Suspects"" the twist is at least a possibility, something that may come to mind, but you wouldn't really consider as being the explanation of the whole story. Fight Club's twist is different. It's as surprising as the one in ""A Beautiful Mind"". Edward Norton's acting too is superb. It's a good enough film, but re-watching it has made me realise that it is not as great as popular culture makes it out to be and it's not better than a lot of the movies from the same year that have been forgotten, whereas ""Fight Club"" very much still lingers around. It's by no means a bad film though. It's great, just not as good as I remembered. Guess a lot's changed since my first time.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Should read the book
",spoiler,"I have not read the book, but probably should.Fight Club is very good at diagnosing the problems: consumerism, capitalism, warmongering, corruption, purposelessness, emptiness, greed etc... parts of the dialogue are pure poetry as they describe how many have been feeling for a long time, since before it was written and still to this day, and beyond.However, it does not offer a good solution. Anarchy and erasing credit does not solve the issues, they most likely will lead to compounding them and more of the same. There should be a radical shift, and Fight Club does not offer that. I don't think it intends to provide a good solution, just an entertaining one.As a movie it is a very good one; great acting, editing, music, camera work, script and plot twists, all of that. Its a classical cult movie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It is such a well throughout plot and the acting is really good too, it's no wonder this film has the reputation it does. Really feel like the main character develops throughout the film, making it feel meaningful. Don't quite get the logistics of how he blew up his apartment or why he wanted to illuminate debt towards the end but this didn't really detract from the film, maybe I wasn't paying enough attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

How many martial arts or fighting movies leave an impact like this this one?! Off hand, besides this one I couldn't tell you off the bat.

This review's time-stamp is quite in accordance with present time, so let me tell you this, that this movie is mesmerizing and is a cult kind of movie (at least for me it is).Not much action if that is what you are looking for as brawling is the only action in the movie.

The characters are some of the most interesting and compelling i have ever seen in any kind of media, except perhaps Lester burnham from American beauty (another great film btw). the way they all fit into the overall plot and story is fantastic and the people who created this masterpiece should all be given huge praise for allowing me to watch the film and then afterwards sit through the credits with a huge smile.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Fight Club? I'm in.
",,"This film is sensational! Although funded by Hollywood, its one of those films that feel really anti-Hollywood and stick a middle finger up to the people behind it and to other powerful companies of the world. As much as it's about fighting, its about the way we live our daily lives. It's quite philosophical in a way. It discusses consumerism, capitalism, crisis in masculinity and all other themes. It's not just about the fighting but even when it is, it's fairly brutal and excuse the phrase 'kick ass'. But its true. The acting is great, the story is great, and who saw that ending coming? I haven't seen a film give me the same buzz as this. I don't mean a buzz to go out fighting or whatever, but a buzz just sitting and watching the story unfold. It really is a masterpiece and I'm not sure how it could be improved, but hey there are going to be people hating on this film and calling it 'controversial' or in bad taste because of some of the things included in the film but lets just stick a finger up at them! If you haven't watched this film already, then unless you have a good excuse, you have missed out on a great piece of cinema.

" Gentlemen, welcome to Fight Club!
",,"Fight Club came out in 1999 and is directed by David Fincher. In another gender, it reminded me of a previous D. Fincher's movie, Seven. Both of these movies stars Brad Pitt, and both shows a very dark and pessimistic aspect of our world and lead the viewers to a complex psychological experience.Fight Club evolves around the character of Edward Norton, the Narrator, whose name is only revealed at the end of the movie. The Narrator lives a lonely, sad life. He's insomniac, lives, eats, sleeps alone. But, the monotony of his life will change after meeting Tyler Durden played by Brad Pitt, with whom he decides to form an underground Fight Club... This is the starting point of a crazy, psycho adventure brilliantly well-thought.I really enjoyed Fight Club, the ending is more than perfect and lights up all of the first confusions, mysteries around The Narrator. The rhythm is really well put, the viewer don't have time to catch up their breath, it could have been another 30 min longer that I wouldn't have mind. Helena Bonham Carter plays here the love interest of the main character and as usual, she is brilliant playing a crazy, weird and trashy poser who will disturb a great deal the routine of The Narrator. And no need to mention that Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are both perfect in their own role.All in all, Fight Club is, for so many reasons, a must-watch movie. It was a pretty big deal when it first came out, so many of you have probably already seen it, but this is the perfect movie to watch and re-watch again and again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Its plot is fantastic and had a twist i really wasn't expecting.And it has a lot of rewatchability. i have watched this movie over 10 times and still noticed new things. Like how Tyler Durton appeared in every scene before we meet him in the plane. And the famous dick at the end of the movie. (Google these two things in case you don't get it). What stands out is the acting, soundtrack, and camera-work.

After few years I watched it again, and this time I ended up speechless. The depth of the characters the minute details and of course the dialog's all were perfect, not to mention the score and the opening scene. The chemistry between Edward Norton and Brad Pitt is perfect. I recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece.

But what is it about Fight Club that makes it unique? In one word: EVERYTHING. The plot is revolutionary (no pun intended) because it starts as a meditation on alienation and loneliness and evolves into a political commentary on today's society. The atmosphere that David Fincher (one of the true masters of today's cinema) builds is one of a world falling to pieces, just like the central character: dark, gritty, nihilistic... the performances are outstanding, specially on the behalf of Brad Pitt, who plays the guy we all want to be at some point: anarchic and free in all the ways possible. In short, a movie that dares to go where few film dare: to the heart of darkness of postmodern society...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" An intellectual thrill ride that has a sense of dark comedy where the movie know what it is.
",spoiler,"This movie is directed beautifully by David Fincher and screenplay by Jim Uhls. It follows the story of a man who hates who he is and is bored of being average, his severe case of insomnia doesn't help. To help his dignity and boredom he is a huge consumer and buys any piece of furniture he feels is unique. He starts going to self help meetings about different diseases and illnesses but he doesn't have any of them. He just goes and cry's there because it helps his insomnia. Although when he meets this woman there, Marla Singer, it stops working. He goes back to being an insomniac and he's miserable again. But when returning from a business trip he meets Tyler Durden, (Brad Pitt). They start talking and Tyler gives him his card. But when The Narrator's apartment blows up he has nowhere to go and he calls Tyler. He moves in with him and they become friends. They start fighting behind a bar just because it's fun and when a couple of guys join they seemingly create Fight Club. Fight Club is a cult like nightly venue where people just punch and get punched and the only rule is ""Don't talk about fight club' but when The Narrator's sanity comes into play and Tyler starts keeping secrets and talking about this ""Project Mayhem"" things go downhill.Now this movie is a amazing and very unique. The tone and dark comedy of this movie is perfect and it's an exhilarating, mind bending thrill ride. I highly recommend David Fincher's Fight Club starring Edward Norton and Brad Pitt.

The title make the film looks like another fight/action film, but, this film made all my assumptions worthless as its one of the BEST films ever. It gives a message that your life is worth living no matter you like it or not. The character Tyler Durden played by one of favorite Brad Pitt shows you how to make life easy. The character portrayed by Edward Norton is another example of how to make a silly looking average man into something more than that, his look and mannerisms shows he is the best for the role.

" Pure Fincher Talent.
",spoiler,"""You cannot be told what Fight Club is; you have to see it for yourself. But only if you think you're hard enough.""Fight Club, directed by David Fincher already had an established fan-base before it hit theatres in 1999 due to the cult novel it was adapted from by Chuck Palahniuk. It is very clear from Fincher's previous work such as Seven (1995), that he has a talented knack for capturing the murkier side of life. He is one of the most alluring visual stylists in cinema who has a very shadowy vision of human nature. These visualisations are portrayed through his narratives which are usually violent and very distinctive; mostly dark, stylish thrillers where every single frame has been calculated to push us closer to the edge as the films progress. Fincher has shown this very effectively in Fight Club, as this movie is no less dark or disturbing than his other work.Fight Club is a dark comic drama, which takes you on a wild ride, luring you in before turning you upside down with a brutal, shocking and frequently unpleasant story; but it is also one of the most brilliant films I have ever seen. It is certainly not a movie that deserved to flop massively on its original release. Some of this negativity could be down to the social context of the time; including the horrific 1999 Columbine shootings. A fraction of the public saw the use of guns and violence in the movie inappropriate for what was happening during this period, which evidently dented the box-office revenue.Edward Norton gives the performance of his career, playing the narrator; there is an on-going debate about whether his name is Jack (the name he refers to during the movie), or Joe (the name he refers to in the book), or whether neither of these are really his nameso we'll stick with calling him the narrator for now. The narrator is a 30-year-old single, nerdy, insomniac, with a highly unsatisfactory white-collar job, which he gets nothing from. He starts searching for some form of emotion in his soulless world by attending support groups for illnesses, such as testicular cancer. Before long, this becomes a weighty addiction. Finding comfort in these sessions, the narrator comes across a trampy but sexy, sceptical, free spirit junkie, Marla, played by the forever-amazing Helena Bonham-Carter. Doing what she does best; Carter is playing her fearless yet dark roles, which are also later shown in the very successful Harry Potter series and Burton's Sweeny Todd (2007). As Marla invades more and more of his gatherings, the narrator is feeling uncomfortable and is in need of a change.His stimulus and motivation arrives with Tyler Durden. Once again in Fincher's hands, Brad Pitt is at the top of his game and at the heart of this black comic picture, not afraid of getting his pretty little face dirty. As Fincher throws us more twists and turns on his narrative roller-coaster ride, the narrator's apartment explodes and he has nobody else to call upon but Durden. So they share a beer and indulge in a bizarre fist-up in a car park. Although he is black and blue, the narrator has never felt so alive and before we know it, they have routed their aggression into a shocking form of therapy; beating each other up. This initiates pain not only for each other, but for the viewer also, causing our stomachs and guts to turn and flip; however we simply cannot look away.Brad Pitt is a great choice and memorable actor to play the very anti-consumerist Durden, who is fed up of the material world that we live in, where ""the things you own end up owning you"". He plans to abolish this nature of society by creating Project Mayhem. Project Mayhem follows Marxism, where in this society the rich upper class that owns the means of production exploits the labour of the lower class. Also anarchy, in the remarkable final scene of the movie where Durden blows up the sky-scraping incorporate businesses and credit card companies, results in the erasing of all debt and making all people in society equal. Fincher develops the narrative by using the occasional freeze-frames to punctuate the action and the subliminal flashes are added for humour. The light comedy contrasts the dark atmosphere and mood of the film and its violence. Although it is violent and funny, it is also a very psychological and complex film to follow.There is an amazing choice of actors who all ensemble together creating worthy and very plausible chemistry on screen. Pitt has highly dangerous yet completely fearless behaviour, presented in the shocking chemical hand-burn scene. He plays his role with such intensity but is also very comical. Norton demonstrates his talent, giving a very unique performance, which cannot be as easy as he makes it look. Bonham-Carter plays the femme fatal manic- depressive character, although somehow still portrays her mysterious and sexy side very successfully.Every aspect of this amazingly directed and performed movie has been worked at until perfect, comparable with all of Fincher's work, from the music, cinematography, screenplay, lighting and pace. Fight Club is one of the few films that I can bear to watch more than once or twice. However, since watching this adrenaline rush of a movie, I have watched it maybe 6 or 7 times at the very least. It is a film that you can watch over and over again without getting bored, but still finds new things to love and enjoy every single time you see it. It's a film you can continuously laugh and cringe at. You can attempt to close your eyes at the extreme violence but continuously fail at doing, wanting to witness more of this incredible picture.

" brad pit just seems to be in a lot of places in this movie
",,"I recently watched a couple of movies. Very old movies more from the nineties are rather interesting. The two thousands has it's quirks. It occurred to me that although movies from the past are better. Movies at present are starting to be a lot more educational. Take for example "" the butler"" is an educational and inspiring. So i cant be biased and say that old movies are the best. When there are some really good ones at present to be highlighted. Movies are windows for one to access the world. May the movie world live long. Although they may not be all we expected we must still appreciate the time, money and effort that actors and directors and producers take to make these movies.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" You Are Not Your F'king Khakis.
",,"Nearly everyone knows the rules, number one of which I'm about to break.What do you do if you're sick of your boring, pathetic life? In the most cathartic, DIY approach possible, Fight Club answers this question: you change it. The absolute prototype of an existential thriller, it wouldn't be taking too much of a leap to suggest that Fight Club is one of the best films ever made.Jim Uhls' excellently adapted screenplay of Chuck Palahniuk's novel (this is the only major work by Uhls that I can find), this thriller has been exciting male audiences the world over since its release in 1999. Even Palahniuk himself said the film was amazing. In fact, he admitted that film was so good, the book in comparison made him feel ashamed.A nameless, pitiful, seemingly friend and family-less Office worker (Edward Norton) suffers from insomnia. True to Palahniuk's style, the solution to the insomnia comes in a bizarre way. He finds relief by attending support groups for diseases, diseases he doesn't have; these people really listen to him, and afterwards, he sleeps. At these meetings he meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Character), a nemesis and lover, and it is through her that Mr. Office worker discovers his true self, but not until after he's transformed more than just his own life.Mr. Pitiful Office worker meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Durden helps Mr. Pitiful Office worker admit to his misery once and for all. Channeling their suppressed male aggression in its rawest form, they start fighting each other. Soon Mr. Pitiful Office worker realizes that he and Durden are not alone. Men, downtrodden, tired of their insignificance as worthless individuals all aim to do something greater. They jump at the chance to vent their primal steam, and the solo fights turn into group fights. Durden's vision eventually transcends aggression in its physical form and becomes something much greater, a community where the individual ceases to exist. As part of this whole, every unnamed member is an equal and significant contributor, and it is through the whole that the individual finds meaning. As part of the whole they are changing the future together.This movie is a directing marvel. With time shifts, psychological manipulations, and very meticulous scene planning, we are kept on the edge of our seats for the entire film. Accompanied by the pounding soundtrack composed by the Dust Brothers, Fincher achieves the rarity of making a movie better than a book. Fincher turns the concrete basement of Lou's Tavern into perhaps the most famous arena in all of modern film. The house on Paper Street, a lone abandoned mansion, becomes a factory of redefinition, of reinvention. In the final scene an amazing mesh between the visuals and the music, The Pixies' ""Where is my Mind,"" Fincher creates one of the most stunning combinations of sight and sound in all of film. And it's a pretty damn good ending to the plot too.The most memorable scene is when Durden is behind the wheel of a car full of passengers. He buckles up, pins the gas, and lets go of the wheel. The car veers off the road and crashes, flipping multiple times. We are force fed the hard truth here. The Fight Club mantra: to change to our lives we need to rid ourselves of our past failures, forget the job, the kids, the car, the living room, the flat screen HDTV, and just let go.

" Great movie worth watching over and over.
",spoiler,"Really enjoyed this movie, even where it differed from the novel, which is rare for me. From the first scene to the end credits I was completely memorized by the constantly evolving story lines and instantly classic quotes. This combined with the large numbers of great actors makes this one of my personal favorites. I highly suggest that anyone who hasn't watched this movie to give it a chance. Among my favorite scenes were the ones involving Tyler speaking about his father while taking a bath, and the scene where he is addressing the members of fight club saying how a whole generation is stuck pumping gas and wasting their lives. The two monologues that he gives in those scenes emphasize some of the more major concerns that men in today's society have to face everyday.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" MY REVIEW: Join the Club!!
",,"Fight Club. Starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Edward an insomniac office worker looking for a way to change his life crosses paths with a devil-may-care soap maker Brad and they form an underground fight club that evolves into something much, much more. It's not an easy movie, it's dangerous, brutal, confrontational, a satire on modern life, brilliantly acted, packs hell lot of clap worthy one liners and above all has a distinctive tone to himself that you can't take your eyes off even for a second. Director David Fincher quite clearly understands when to go fast, when to pause so that you can enjoy the delicious scenes. He takes you through a thrilling roller coaster ride with an array of crazy characters in crazy places and in crazy circumstances. I personally did not like the way it ended but that's just a nitpicking.

" cool movie
",,"Fight Club is multi-faceted movie about a man who is deeply unsatisfied with his life in the modern age, even with all the trappings of success that much of our society is based on, and decides to go off the beaten path to find his own personal satisfaction. From that point on the movie spirals out of control and into the abyss. This is a good thing. The movie holds many meanings and shows the characters in favorable and unfavorable ways. It does not try to cast things in a typical good and evil view point, nor does it say whether the choices the protagonist and the rest of the cast make are sound ones. One of the things it does do is look into the nature of our past, viewing the structure of our society and analyzing why we do what we do to live. It isn't until the narrator (Edward Norton) begins to destroy himself that he finally comes to realize what matters to him. That is when he meets two important characters, Marla Singer and Tyler Durden. It is during this time that the narrator escapes from his normal life by hosting with Tyler an underground fight club that evolved from the two just fighting outside of a local bar. Taking in Tyler's view on life, which is somewhat refreshing and scary at the same time, they form a close bond strongly resembling a married couple. The two do everything together and the narrator begins to emulate Tyler more and more, all the while the fight club grows stronger and stronger until it has become this cult-like phenomenon with Tyler and the narrator as leaders making rules for conducting fight club. Anarchy and non-conformity is their message, which I believe is meant to underscore the irony of fight club and their non-conformist, fight the man attitude. As the group evolves into something more dangerous, this irony becomes more apparent in the way those who once questioned the established authority, now blindly follow their ""non-conformist"" new group. Its been a little over a decade since Fight Club ""enlightened"" me, but it still gives me the same conflicting feelings about its message and the nature of humanity in general. There are those who would take it at its face value and see nothing but frustrated, grown men beating each other senselessly, and that's a shame because there is definitely much more going on then that. David Fincher has crafted an excellent movie: it's disgustingly stylish in its execution...almost too much, if that's possible. The sound track, done by the Dust Brothers burrowed it's way into my brain and never left. The movie would not be the same without it. As far as the actors performances, Ed Norton and Brad Pitt both have a strong rapport and the scenes come off naturally, while Helena Bonham Carter's Marla is hauntingly tragic, and filled with a desperate, but subtle sadness to her. At the time of the original screening this movie polarized people into the two camps of love or hate, due to it's ability to offended or amaze, but I wouldn't have it any other way",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight club depicts the loneliness of a man in the modern age
",,"Fight Club is a unique movie.It provides quality entertainment. Basically it depicts the boring and dull life of an average western person.He is so fed up of his routine office life that he starts to find joy in fighting, which he starts by himself in a club.Later on, people start entering in his fighting club.They start to grow from a few to thousands and up to the level that they create chaos in the whole country. Theme of the movie is that in the modern age people are slaves of the system and they have no freedom for pursuing what they desire.They have to walk on the guidelines of the society and at last die. The hero is actually shown suffering from some sort of personality disorder but on the other way around it shows that due to his dull life life he has got no real friend and he enjoys his own company by hanging out by himself.Its the dilemma of modern age.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" A true man movie!
",spoiler,"I warned of spoilers in that little box up there, so don't be blacklisting me! I don't necessarily give movies a 10 because they seem like infallible movies from heaven above. I give movies a 10 because they are so kick razz that I watched them 100 times and I still love each viewing.Ratings are really relative to the personality of the viewer and/or reviewer. Fight Club is superbly made with the awesome Edward Norton whose alter-ego/second personality is Brad Pitt.They start bad razz clubs underneath bars for men to kick the living crap out of each other to attain some relief. How awesome is that? I won't spoil it too much, but I did give warning. I'm going to skip over most of the surprises within the movie, but will say that Meatloaf has a nice rack.Lastly I do want to say that a weird cult that starts taking down corporate overlords is totally awesome. We are a generation of men raised by women. We spend fake money on stupid shlt we don't need.Very deep and just totally awesome to me. Censors, well I censored my own naughty words I believe.

" Celebrating Masculinity
",spoiler,"Both a criticism and celebration of masculinity. The narrator (Edward Norton) looks to (Brad Pitt)Tyler Durden as an anarchic role model and takes on his nihilistic view of life.The film is gritty and displays the male primal lust for violence. This acts as an outlet or breakaway for the narrator from the stagnant regime of office work. People who have seen this film before will understand it's mastery in foreshadowing.My favourite scene is where the narrator beats up 'Angel face' a relatively handsome blonde character. The audio makes the scene brutal and the narrator is dubbed over declaring these nihilistic statements of ""I want to breathe smoke""There are lot's of messages in Fight Club, there is a sense of anti- capitalism. ""We work to earn money to buy s**t we don't need."" There is a desire for everyone to be equal ""you are the all singing all dancing c**p of the world."" There's progression from rebellion against societal expectancy that turns to terrorism. The film can be seen as a critique of totalitarianism, where people's humanities are blurred. The narrator has to remind others that when Bob dies ""his name was Robert Paulson.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Loved this movie and actually I'm gonna watch it again tonight :) Yes this film does have it's typical Hollywood overdoing things, it would be a better film without that. Maybe Hollywood should re-evaluate the way they make movies after they watch this one a few more times to see what good and realism they put in it, versus the over-doing scenarios.

Fight Club is a film that people take literally from screen to heart to home to the mirror asking all the right questions. It is a rare achievement for any film to be embraced by viewers to this degree of cult film devotion. Overrated? Absolutely not! I give this film five stars and a ten because it didn't just linger it invaded the way that people thought about being possessed by one's own possessions and the how and why we eventually surrender to social stigmas and parental direction over our own dreams.

" There truly is nothing quite like it, making it a must-see for just about anyone.
",,"Believe it or not, David Fincher's 1999 classic Fight Club was a major box office flop during its theatrical run. On a $63 million budget, the film failed to break even during its run, making only $37 million. However, as time passed, the film was recognized by more and more people, and soon became a cult classic among movie fans. Before the release of Fight Club, Fincher had a hit-or-miss filmography. His film Seven was a huge success, but Alien 3 was mixed upon moviegoers. Fight Club renewed Fincher's career, as it is an extremely well directed look into the psychology of society.Based on the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, Fight Club tells the story of an unnamed narrator. As an employee for an automobile company, The Narrator suffers from a severe case of insomnia every night. Looking for a way to get some sleep, The Narrator finds emotional release in support groups that he attends, fooling the members into thinking he is a victim just like them. He soon becomes addicted to this new strategy, until the mysterious Marla Singer causes him to ditch the support groups.It is then that The Narrator runs into a man named Tyler Durden on one of his business flights. After The Narrator's apartment is destroyed by an explosion, he moves in with his new friend, who slowly turns The Narrator's life upside down. One night at a bar, The Narrator and Tyler get the idea to open an after-hours ""fight club"" in the basement of the bar, where men can come and fight for recreational purposes. The fight club soon evolves into an idea that is much more complex than The Narrator had expected, and changes him entirely. Fight Club's story is very thought-provoking and fascinating, with lots of thought put into it. Essentially a satire of society, Fight Club asks a lot of questions about society and the psychology of the everyman within society. The screenplay is extremely well written, with a dark sense of humor and fantastic narration mixed in with the actual dialogue of the movie. The film also contains one of the greatest plot twists in film, which makes so much sense upon multiple viewings. The acting is simple phenomenal. Edward Norton is fantastic in the main role as The Narrator, nailing the insomniac elements of his character. His acting is especially great considering the aforementioned plot twist required a large change in acting from Norton. Brad Pitt is simply amazing as Tyler Durden, earning the character a spot on countless lists of great film characters. Pitt essentially plays a character every man wishes he could be, and he does so with awesome charisma and acting skill. Helena Bonham Carter, often overlooked by the two male protagonists, is a very important Marla Singer. She plays the role extremely well, and deserves more attention for it.Like his other films, Fincher brings an extremely unique directing style to Fight Club. Full of quick one frame cuts, fourth wall breaking, dazzling cinematography, and an interesting art direction, watching Fight Club feels like a surreal and unique experience that is rivaled by no other film. Fincher also crams so many small details into the tiniest nooks and crannies of the story, which eagle-eyed viewers may catch and genuinely enjoy due to the pure intelligence of these details. The film is incredibly well directed, and this is just one of Fight Club's strong points.Fight Club certainly deserves its spot in cult classic territory. The film successfully launched the fimmaking career of the genius that is David Fincher, even with Alien 3 and Seven under his belt. Full of brilliant acting performances, an engaging story that is adapted very well, and near perfect direction crammed with the smallest, yet smartest, of details, Fight Club is simply brilliant. The movie is more than just a testosterone-fueled, manly fighting montage; it's a psychological journey about consumerism and the everyman. There truly is nothing quite like it, making it a must-see for just about anyone.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Movie a about a man who is fed up with life and seeks excitement through the magic of his brain,
",spoiler,"Great movie, great plot, fantastic acting. I'm a sucker for all Helenas movies so there is that too. I think it's a great, if not slightly unrealistic, picture on how a lot of people feel today (not the schizo part)but the insomnia, the depression, the need to keep up appearances. It's a modern classic that people owe it to themselves to see so go ahead do it! I doubt anyones every regretted seeing this movie. And the ending is beautiful in a creepy kinda way but isn't love all that we want in the end? - Okay cheesy line aside, do yourself a favour and watch this sooner than later - Oh my I should stop now.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Possibly Fincher's finest
",,"David Fincher's ""Fight Club"" is based on the novel of the same name by literary provocateur Chuck Palahniuk. It tells the story of an insomniac office worker (Edward Norton) who befriends a rebellious soap manufacturer (Brad Pitt). Together they form the titular 'fight club', an outlet for male aggression that evolves into a network of men with an anarchic agenda.One of the film's strong points is the adapted screenplay by Jim Uhls, which unfortunately went unnoticed at Oscar time. The script isn't exactly what you'd call conventional but Uhls managed to make it comprehensible without robbing the story of its depth. The ending might be a bit questionable but, overall, the plot is continually engrossing and unpredictable.David Fincher's direction is expertly handled, as always. The movie looks attractive from beginning to end and the concealment of the big twist holds up pretty well even in retrospect. In the music department, the soundtrack by the Dust Brothers is sometimes striking but is ultimately overshadowed by the use of the Pixies' ""Where Is My Mind"" over the closing credits.The film's two stars, Edward Norton & Brad Pitt, both delivered fine performances but I think I'd give the edge to Norton if only because his role was the more challenging of the two. Helena Bonham Carter made a pretty good pair with Norton, though she's an actress whom I'm not particularly fond of. In support, the only real standout is Meat Loaf, of all people.Ultimately, ""Fight Club"" isn't quite perfect but I still think that it's one of the most interesting films of the 90's. The fact that it currently occupies the #10 spot in the IMDb top 250 is a bit of a surprise since I'd expect this to be exactly the type of movie that divides audiences. In any case, it's definitely worth watching, though it should be noted that the film's appeal is probably greatest for young males.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Great touches, awesome movie to watch more than once
",,"When I first saw this movie, i couldn't see what was all the hush about. After a while I started to grow thinking on it and see a bigger perspective on the movie. That got me to watch again and understand it clearer. And it did work, making me realize every time i'd watch, i'd notice something different.I honestly loved the quotes and the touches made to life, how we live, government etc. It's a dark movie written with wit. The quotes could become your life motto. Simply put, this movie is enough not only to make your grateful that you watched it but also make remarkable touches to your life. Also especially the song 'Where is my Mind' and the soundtrack really, really fits the movie. It has also become one of my favorite songs.If you haven't already seen it, it's an important movie that should be on top of your watch-list.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" A wronged movie...

That was something that even today I can not understand it and I can not imagine a reason why is that happened.Edward Norton makes an another perfect performance as well as Brad Pitt, but I think Edward Norton steals the show with his interpretation. I can compare his good performance with the performance he made in the movie ""Primal Fear"" three years earlier than this movie.I think that you will love this movie because it has plenty of action and of course as you can see from the title of the film, much violence.

",,"Well, how can i explain how much i liked this movie? Brad Pitt acts spectacular, the same Helena Bonham Carter, but Edward Norton takes the all the credits. This movie talks about everything: anarchy, capitalism, insatiable consumption, and, of course, fight. The rules of the Fight Club are wonderful, the perfect place to unburden and i just simply love the scene where the fight club starts expanding and everyone knows about it but no one reveals it. The movie shows how a man exits the routine, how someone unnoticeable, escapes from the normal an common society. It is a movie you need to see. No exceptions. P.D. sorry for my bad English, i am trying to improve it, hope you understand.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The whole movie is fabulous, and the fact that there is a mind-screwing plot that you don't realize until the end is absolutely amazing. While you feel you understand the movie from start to finish, you get completely set back near the end and have to rethink what is really true about the film.Both actors Norton and Pitt were wonderful for the roles, and I feel like Norton played a perfectly insane person; it was amazing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The first time I ever say this film, I had no clue whatsoever as to what the premise of the film was. The ending left me truly satisfied with the film I had just devoted the time to watch.

" My assessment about Fight Club.
",spoiler,"Fight Club (1999) Today I have seen this movie. It was released at 15 October in 1999. It is a dram type movie, directed by David Fincher, starred by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter and several others.In my perception, it is another special kind of brain crushing, psychotic movie. The name ""Fight Club"" seems like that it can be a total fighting or conventionally action movie. But I think, it is stuff of an insomniac patient's subconscious or may be unconscious mind. The man (Edward Norton, who narrates) was fed of the total system and his physical and mental conditions and he was finding an escape to find peace and to find assurance of night sleeping. But a stranger girl named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), who was a drug addicted chick, distorted him from his normal pace. He was lost his attention and crushed on her. His all attempts of getting peace had gone in vain.Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) was not a man, but another soul of that distorted guy, who was a symbol of rebellion, that was hidden in that guy's subconscious mind. He was always thinking like that, he wanted to fight with everyone and everything which was bothering him a lot, like his boss. So, the ""Fight Club"" was formed on the basis of his idea which was promoted by Tyler Durden. But, that Tyler Durden was no one but him. But, his conscious mind's logic and morality was not supporting it, as the time was running. So, it gradually became a fight between two souls, in one's body. That was completely psychotic.What so ever, this movie is awesome. In fact, it is teaching us about that, if someone wants to find peace and do things with a cool mind, he or she should hear to his or her subconscious mind. In the body of human, it is the real human. So, respect it and score, otherwise it is eternal fighting, eternal Fight Club.Faraid Mobin Dipon 29.07.2013",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A Brilliant Adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's Thrilling and Insightful Novel
",,"Some things are worth breaking the rules over, and despite Tyler's wishes, it's about time I talked about Fight Club. Not enough can be said about this film; its style and music set the tone in a way that echoes the vibes of the novel to near perfection.Most people would not see the film as a love story, but is in fact self described by the author as a ""modern day Great Gatsby."" Fight Club tells the story of two men, (played by Brad Pitt and Edward Norton), whose lives intertwine more than is on the surface, and their complex, incredibly dark and twisted relationship with one Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). Carter has been casted perfectly for the role of the damaged girl damsel, and she delivers on every level.Timing is everything, and Marla forces herself into the insomniac Narrator's life (Norton)at his various weekly support groups, a community he has found to seek some sort of solace. Her presence ruins these meetings for him, which is when he meets Tyler and discovers fight club -- a different type of therapy. The fight club, and the relationship between these three characters and the world that surrounds them, undergoes a twisting journey that becomes more than could ever be expected. Their narrative, not unlike Gatsby, provides the context and examination of modern society and American values in the form of a psychological thriller that is certain to raise questions, eyebrows, and testosterone levels whenever watched.Enjoy this movie, just be careful who you talk to about it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A Real Classic

I knew nothing about it other than the fact that it was about a bunch of guys boxing/fighting, or so I thought.It's purely a psychological analysis and one that David Fincher captured so perfectly. I mean it's one of those films that you watch over and over....I watch it to this day and I catch something new every time.I won't spoil the movie for you but please give it a chance. it is a great story and Fincher took Plahnuk's novel and made it into a masterpiece of a film. It's no wonder it's a cult classic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Beautiful and Brutal
",,"Known for its intense, brutal violence and ideological themes, Fight Club is considered by many one of the greatest films of the last two decades. With it's great narrative, quirky humour and compelling characters it is truly a film to enjoy. It is based on the novel by the same name by Chuck Palahniuk and is directed by David Fincher. Edward Norton portrays the film's protagonist. Norton's nameless character - which is only referred to as ""The Narrator"" - is stuck at a dead-end job living in his small apartment full of Ikea-junk. He's working at a car company where he spends his days filling out forms, making copies, drinking coffee and getting yelled at. After a long day at the office he comes home to his Ikea-infested two-room apartment, watches TV, eats his microwave-heated dinner and goes to bed. The narrator describes his life and his view of the world through dialogue where he uses sharp satire and direct social criticism. The narrator is a depressed social outcast that needs something – or someone - to get his life going. He also suffers from insomnia, which doesn't make his life any more manageable. He eventually finds a rather odd ailment for his illness. He attends a support group for men who have suffered testicular cancer. This quickly becomes an addiction. He finds himself attending to several different groups a week and being unable to sleep without them. He does this undisturbed for some time until he meets a woman by the name of Marla Singer. Marla, played by Helena Bonham Carter, is a so-called ""tourist""; a person - who just likes the main character - attends self-help and therapy groups to make herself feel better. Knowing that there is another faker present he fails to open himself up emotionally. As a result of this the narrator fails to sleep once again.He eventually finds himself on a business flight sitting next to Tyler Durden. Portrayed by Brad Pitt, Tyler Durden is a genuine menace. Tyler shows strong disregard against society and the materialistic way of life of the western civilization. He believes that in order to truly be free you first have to lose everything. He is also an avid soap-maker. Through a various turn of events the Narrator and Tyler starts to organize a weekly fight club for men. More and more people hear about this and the club quickly expands. But as the fight club grows and becomes more organized the narrator starts to ask himself new questions: what exactly is happening around him and is there more to Tyler Durden than he is aware of?David Fincher has made a number of great films throughout his career (Se7ven, The Curious Case of Benjamin Button) and Fight Club is no exception. He has done an excellent job transferring the book to the silver screen and has gained much admiration for it. Fincher's use of violence in the film is not something to shy away from. The brutal and graphic fight scenes were strongly criticized when it first came out in 1999. Not unlike Stanley Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange from 1971, it was condemned by many as a film that glorifies violence. In many ways these two movies are not very different. The use of violence and the human psyche is an on-going theme throughout both films. But the movie is not all about physical fighting. The film also focuses on emotional, mental and ideological fighting. It's about finding yourself and finding out what you really want to do with your life. There are a lot of factors that makes this film great; it is funny, it's brutal, and it's inspirational. It makes you question your own existence and what you are really supposed to do. Brad Pitt does an exceptionally good role as Tyler Durden, which is without a doubt one of his greatest performances to date. He is mesmerizing, and he really does a believable role as the charismatic and revolutionary sociopath. Along with Pitt is Edward Norton, who does an excellent job as the gloomy and often confused narrator. Elena Bonham Carter also does an avid and amusing role as the suicidal Marla Singer. The leading actors work really well together and it is plain to see that they have a lot of good chemistry throughout the film. Meat Loaf also plays a refreshing and fun part as the testicular cancer-victim and former bodybuilder Bob.Fight Club is a truly great film with a social message that many will sit and ponder over. The film combines violence, social criticism, masculinity, human relations and psychology in a mix that is sure to make an impression. It is without a doubt one of the most noteworthy films that has been made the last couple of decades. It is a film that many will enjoy, but some may occasionally cringe at some of its scenes. But no matter how you feel about this film you must not forget the first (and the s",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A Testosterone Masterpiece
",,"The male world just got with this film its ultimate masterpiece, it will even make guys laugh, think, and even cry. Yeah, ""Fight Club"" can do that to any man to watch these unforgettable 2:19 hours of pure excitement! ""Fight Club"" is a testosteronic classic to be remembered, the title just sounds like a fight film, but who thinks that are wrong, the movie goes much deeper than that.The story begins with this guy (Edward Norton), who during the movie never says or mentions his name. He works at a car agency and spends its life in the office. He suffers from insomnia and doesn't know what to make of his life felling an immense and deep hole. Then he begins attending therapy groups to be able to express himself and put everything out and always have company. In one of these groups he meets and ""falls in love"" to the weird smoking Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) who happens to have the same trend he attending several therapy groups. One day, during a business trip he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). The guy and Tyler have the same thoughts about life and what to do with it, then both start a strong friendship and arrange a new form of therapy, a male therapy which consists in beat the crap out of each other (in other words, fighting). Then they create ""Fight Club"", which attracts many followers to this male therapy where men in the middle of a fight can unleash all his anger and anguish that he carries, it doesn't matter of his going to win or not. But the club is just a much bigger plan that Tyler plans by every passing minute.The film, as the title says is about a Fight Club, but the film not only focuses attention on fighting scenes (which are many). But through this club, Tyler tries to convey his major criticism of society. The film raises a number of criticisms and questions about the society we live in and how dirty it is, these criticisms come to us through the constant black humor and male philosophy leaving us thinking for days.The writing of Jim Uhls (screenplay) is superb, explores our society through dialogs and breathtaking scenes, and the direction of David Fincher makes it all fantastic.""Fight Club"" is the testosteronic masterpiece to be remembered forever, thanks to a fantastic writing and direction and superb performances from both Brad and Edward leaves the film just MAGNIFICENT.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The pacing was great, the visual effects were stunning, and the overall concept was just unbelievable.At first, I didn't believe the rules of fight club. There is an established fight club. But no bets. No groupies. Its not even a fight to the death. You simply threw punches just to feel satisfied and happy. But then there was a deeper meaning to that, and I finally understood.In addition, the twist at the end just blew me away. Maybe some had predicted it already, but I was really surprised because I did not expect it to be that kind of movie.The cast was also great, particularly Edward Norton (why isn't he as famous as Brad Pitt?

" Bravely experimentally creative movie-making
",,"One of the best movies ever made: An exercise in ""visual philosophy"", using all technical resources to illustrate and narrate a mental- imaginary-and-machinations based plot line. Fight Club is a fable of the id, ego, and super ego interacting, to revive the main character (""Jack) from his stupor. This lethargy and detachment from his bodily needs and id instincts, prevents him to sleep and mate. His sexual drive and need for love have been channeled into consumerism. He buys things he doesn't need compulsively, to escape his misery without success. The solutions he (or his psyche segments) comes up with are evolutionary, but basically of the same substance he longs and aches for to awaken him from this lethargy. He starts off visiting shockingly bleeding heart - support groups. Used to the corporate politically correct, neutral and aseptic dialogues, this candidness rattles him up towards vitality, recognizing his own humanity, enlightening the steps to come in the path. Nirvana is his desired path, the path at the very core of all human being that looks for religion, drugs or any perception of god or what is beyond words and things, and ultimately that ghost inside us. His Id/super ego is Tyler Durden. He shows him how to escape from fear. That fear that drove him to drown himself into things, in work and vapid banality. Then there comes the Fight Club. ""Fight club wasn't about winning or losing""... ""It wasn't about words"", says Jack. It is not about violence in the sense of hurting someone else out of anger, I would add. Jack is detached from the animal we are, that eats, defecates, has sex and breathes. Jack is detached from the caveman we have been for thousands of years, that ""civilized"" men despise, but is rooted in our DNA. Jack is an extreme case of the dangers of excessive consumerism, individuality and materialism of our culture. Jack fears loosing (a fight, his job, anything that threatens his ego or causes him pain) and longs for human contact and intimacy. Searching for a relationship is a big stretch. Baby steps, the support group first. Then fighting furnishes him with all this. I would like to address the movie's critics like Robert Ebert, who fail to seize the zeitgeist and how fight club relates and how the violence is tangential. The story is about a very particular individual with a very common pathology who seeks a very unorthodox solution in a very dire, desperate situation. This masterpiece exercises and puts forth ""visual philosophy"", displaying what would be a modern version of Zen enlightenment's exercises or Koans. There is no doctor that treats greed and Ikea fetishes. This dude is on his own. He needs to get in touch with his masculinity and loose the fear at the root of all fears, the fear of death, and so do the other attendees of the Fight Club. Fighting is a start; the fear of physical harm is in the same line. Guys don't go to Fight Club to win, everyone is a winner, because the target is to unload the burden of fear. If you desensitize yourself to the fear of punches and blood, abstract fear triggers, as being fired diminish by contrast. Our culture is plagued with fears of the unknown, the what ifs that blocks us from taking risks that could change or enhance our life. Tyler Durden, the superego is boundless and moves forward unfettered to things that are not realistic for the ego, the pranks and crimes against possessions of the project mayhem. But before that he confronts Jack with the fear of death using chemical burn. Crazy, unorthodox yet effective, and more important in a movie: entertaining. Finally, Jack evolves towards love, the main driver from the start. The movie is a love story. His relationship with the woman is abrasive, because his sexuality is twisted, hence is expressed through unexpected outlets and forms at the start. He develops his personality and is able to express caring for a female and start a relationship and integrates his psyche, destroying his overpowering superego. Metaphorically expressed by the dissolution of Tyler. A beautifully aesthetically stunning crafted movie, fluid as our thougth processes are. From the start it displays a voyage through the brain's fear center. As a fable that it is, the use of special effects and creative, aggressive, edgy cinematography suspends your disbelief into a journey into a very human experience, a tale about our war. As Tyler Durden says when he puts the finger on our greed/consumerism epidemic: ""our war is a spiritual war"". Interwoven masterfully are the elements of a man's struggle with this disease and fighting our war. It never stops being an action film. The rant that Tyler delivers to the fight club, encapsulates some of the concerns the movie wants to bring the audience to brood upon. It is one of the few easy lines thrown in your lap to understand the movie and the issues brought to light. Issues related to living lives without meaning, in mechanic jobs we hate, to buy stuff conditioned by the media to, but that we really don't truly need. We've become consumer droids. Space monkeys conditioned to press buttons towards oblivion. The media offers its carrot: fame, fortune, and every Ego-booster conceivable. And if the entanglement is rooted on the ego logic, ego perception and egotistic behavior it only messes up the problem further. All reinforces the need to gain awareness of the influence of the ego. The movie doesn't wrap up nicely the majority of the answers to these questions, and throws them on your lap. This movie left me with the strong impression of watching one of the most aggressive criticisms towards the dangers of excessive consumerism, of my generation. It is difficult to believe it was made by the director of Seven and two of the most prominent actors of our generation,who put their necks on the line to express these concerns.Bravo!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Best Film of all Time-Life Changing......

How deep this movie is breaks all kind of boundaries.PLEASE see this with an open-mind and realize it is not all about fighting, although the CLUB is a major aspect of the film, hence the title.If I could of named it, I probably would of named it Tyler Dudren since it is about Pitts character quite a bit.Like I said I thought I would say something about my favourite film which is a 10-10 but I do not want to give anything away.ENJOY!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" excessively superb film
",,"If you are looking for entertainment and mind boggling at the same time, this is the perfect one for that matter. This movie is a absolutely superb. It takes you to a totally different level. The story and direction are just so amazing that you can't predict this movie until you are very great at predicting. 'Fight Club' had me thinking days after it had finished and it might even be better watching it the second, third, fourth, or fiftieth time though. Fightclub is a movie that makes you think about what you've done with your life, about everything, and especially society and mediocrity. Be prepared to realize that, as Tyler Durden says, ""We are all part of the same compost heap."" Firstly there is no actor that can ever compare to Edward Norton. Norton has a calm intensity that is riveting. If you haven't watched this film till date then don't wait further and watch this film now. I strongly recommend Fight Club to you. exceptional film... 10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Great film
",spoiler,"So, I'm probably one of the last people in the world to watch 'Fight Club' My first experience with Fight Club didn't go well. I watched the first 20 minutes and I fell bored out of my mind but then I decided to watch it for a second time starting from the beginning and boy! This time I was thoroughly entertained by the film. Why!?!Simple, the film had great acting, a great story behind it with clever dialogue and a great mystery behind the whole story. The pacing of the film and the fact that the Narrator is held at gunpoint by Tyler and goes back to recount how he met Tyler and what happened between the two to form the Fight Club which later turned into the deadly 'Project Mayhem'. The story was all very interesting and the film ended really well. Never during the film the second time did I feel bored or just begin to hate it. The film flowed along very nicely. I in particular enjoyed the chemistry between the Narrator and Brad Pitt's Tyler Durton. This is definitely one classic that you cannot miss out on.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" One of the best of 90's
",,"I am really in love with the decade of 90's which gave us such unforgettable masterpieces like Pulp Fiction, matrix, Usual suspects, American History X and many more. But this is definitely the stand out film amongst the many mentioned above.With Impeccable duologue's, amazing performances from all the three central characters, exceptional direction, unforgettable story, the only thing i feel that went wrong with the movie was the title(according to me). Because like few others i started off watching this film expecting it to be an action thriller but i ended up watching a mind boggling art.I had seen a few movies of David Fincher like Seven and Panic Room and frankly, it was not enough for me to become an avid follower of his movies. But since Fight Club he has become one of my favorite director and i have enjoyed his movies and to a certain extent interpreted his way of story telling.Fight Club opens up with a very unique way of story telling with Ed Norton as the Narrator of the film and Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. As the movie progresses and the audiences begin to believe that it is not just about a fight club but there is much more to the story as it becomes equally confusing as to what exactly the movie is referring to, Is it about fight club or is it about the characters in the film. But above the story and characters it is definitely David Fincher who deserves the major lot of the credit for directing such an engaging story. Fight Club at times can be disturbing but it keeps you stuck to your seats for entire 140 minutes.It was extremely surprising to note that the movie got nominated for best effects and sound effects editing and not for best film, or director or any actor. Although the movie has not won any Oscar, it remains to be a masterpiece.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Where was my mind?
",,"This film has been out long enough to make a legitimate review either irrelevant or redundant; unless of course you've never seen it, in which case you really should decide for yourself its merits or lack thereof.I will comment on the appreciation I have for the sound work in this film; especially the treatment given to the final musical selection (i.e., it's near impossible to hear a song in its completion and without a severe hatchet-job in any movie, for obvious reasons) most attempts at incorporating popular music end in MTV-esque sound bites that resemble a delusional DJ with ADHD.Lastly, kudos to Mr. Fincher's menu concept for the Blu-ray release; even knowing what the film was about, I was still taken off guard.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club
",spoiler,"The narrator, who is played by Norton, is identified in the script as Jack but is left nameless in the film. He suffers from insomnia and is just missing something in his life, but he does not know what that something is. He can't sleep, can't think, basically a zombie. He goes to support groups for clarity on anything at all and it makes him happy. After a woman starts showing up to these support groups, he returns to his sad, insomniac ways. He drives himself so crazy his mind creates ""Tyler,"" whom he starts a fight club with. He creates Tyler because that is the thing he is missing. He wants to be the person he created but just is not that person so he creates him in his mind, so only he can see and hear him.Throughout the beginning of the movie, before Tyler is introduced, you see the a flash of a person just standing in random places for a split second. This is when the narrator is at his worst with his insomnia. The flash you see turns out to be Tyler. The narrator is so sleep deprived, he imagines these things that aren't actually there. When the narrator is on the plane and meets Tyler for the first time, it shows both characters' brief cases. They are identical. Also at work, the narrator's boss wears different colored ties on different days, and they are said to determine the day and mood of his boss.There are so many scenes that are so significant in this film. However, each character has a scene that is so important to the entire film. For Marla, who is Tyler's/ the narrator's lover, her big scene is when she is introduced. She comes into the film with a bad reputation already, saying how she ruined the narrator's life. She appears to be the root of all that is evil in the film. Had she not have gone to the support groups, the narrator would still go to them to be happy and actually get sleep, which would lead to the narrator not having to create Tyler, then start fight club and eventually blow up half the city. She is the base for all that happens in the rest of the film. For the narrator and Tyler, I believe a big scene for them was when they first fight in the parking lot of the bar. It just went on to show how rapidly something like that grows because within the next month it was huge. For the narrator, his scene is after the scene in the bathroom with Tyler, when he is at work. He is talking with his boss and usually when he talks with him, he is polite and obeying, but this time was different. The narrator lashes out on him after his boss questions him about a paper that was on the copier. This is where you can tell the narrator is growing to be more and more like Tyler. He just stopped caring altogether. The big scene for Tyler was when he went over the rules of Fight Club. The first two rules are that you do not talk about Fight Club. Tyler stresses the importance of secrecy for the whole operation and you could tell this is where Tyler knew it was going to be big.By seeing how the narrator creates Tyler, how he goes to support groups, him blowing up his own apartment, starting Fight Club, and eventually starting a cult-like group goes to show just how sad he really is. Even if they don't directly go out and say he is not happy, it shows throughout the movie that he is a sad, lonely, and quite frankly, a straight up crazy person. All of these instances are just a few from the movie, but there are plenty more that show he's insane. Starting a cult-like group does not occur this once for Norton's career. His character in ""American History X"" does almost the same thing.As far as knowing the narrator was a little crazy, it was obvious to tell he was maybe just a little. You could say it he is a little strange because he wakes up in different places and does not remember how he got there, or because he goes to support groups just to help him sleep at night. But nothing to the extent of what it showed at the end. He creates this alter ego that in the end almost ends up killing him and succeeds in blowing up buildings and never realizes it was really him until Tyler tells him about it. I don't think anyone saw that coming, but you could definitely tell something a little weird was going on with the narrator.The movie itself I feel would be difficult to create but the director nailed it. The scene where Tyler burns the narrator's hand with a chemical is where you can really see the power Tyler has and you can tell the narrator starts to get a little frightened of him and his intentions. Another is when you find out Tyler was really just in the narrator's head and they recap points in the movie where you thought Tyler was the person doing these things but it turns out it was really the narrator. That scene answered any questions of how they did it. Also throughout the movie it did a really great job at hiding but at the same time hinting Tyler was just a figment of the narrator's imagination. The only thing I would question about the movie is when the narrator meets Tyler in the airport and sees Tyler leave in a car he just stole. I personally do not see the importance of him stealing the car and I don't understand who actually stole the car.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Mischief. Mayhem. Soap.
",,"Nothing says ""ANARCHY!! COS F**K YEAH!!"" like a healthy punch to the ear. And if you are in the mood to scream a big, fat ""F**k You"" to the world, then this is the film for you.Fight Club's nameless protagonist (Edward Norton) begins unravelling as he endures a destructive bout of insomnia. After following his doctor's advice, he becomes addicted to therapy groups and meets Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter). After this short-lived encounter with the only female in the movie, our narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a business flight. Their camaraderie eventually sees them starting a fight club built on the philosophy of anarchy and rejection of societal status quo. But is anarchy really the answer? How far do you take it?﻿﻿ If you have ever felt like a consumerist machine then I urge you to try this for kicks. The novel by Chuck Palaniuk is also a must read (but should be judged separately from the film as they differ in many aspects).Stand outs: Meatloaf as ""B**ch-tits Bob"": has to be seen to be believed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A memorable, iconoclastic, disturbing film
",spoiler,"'Fight Club' is a memorable, iconoclastic, disturbing film. Director David Fincher's visual style is really on display here - he has an exceptionally good eye, and the film is not only thematically dark but also quite dark visually. The visual darkness of this movie recalls Fincher's earlier film 'Se7en', which also starred Fincher regular Brad Pitt.The Narrator (who remains unnamed throughout the course of the film but who is played by Edward Norton in a wonderfully neurotic performance) is an insomniac office worker who feels as though he is a slave to corporate ideals and senses that his humdrum life has no meaning. Things change drastically via a chance meeting with an anarchist soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt). Together, the two men channel their latent male aggression by forming a primal 'fight club' which meets on a regular basis in the dank basement of a seedy bar named Lou's Tavern. This cabalistic club invites fellow frustrated angry young men to find catharsis by fighting each other and rediscovering their baser instincts. But Tyler has an even more ambitious agenda in mind...This film, while highly recommended, is definitely not for the squeamish. Special makeup effects genius Rob Bottin provides some very graphic makeups and, while the film is about a lot more than just violence, there are some pretty horrifying moments. The violence depicted here is stomach-churning and horrific, and this is precisely how violence SHOULD be presented on screen. This is, after all, what real violence is like.'Fight Club' has become a cult classic and rewards repeat viewings. The source material - Chuck Palahniuk's 1996 novel - is an excellent read shot through with a dark vein of black humour. Returning to the film, particular mention should go to British actress Helena Bonham Carter, who is wonderful as the bonkers Marla Singer, a suicidal woman who is sucked into Tyler's world. Carter made her name in period pieces like 'A Room With a View' and 'Howards End' so it is exciting to see her play a very different role here. And she has great fun with it.I sense that 'Fight Club' is going to live for a long, long time. For a mainstream film, it is intelligent, vital, and has a great deal to say about modern society and the way we live our lives.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" One of the most engrossing movie's I've ever seen
",,"Fight club is a very baffling film that may change you're perceived outlooks on life and society. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton give in my opinion the best performances of their careers, and it's David Fincher's best film to date.The film deals with an unnamed narrator who works for a crooked insurance agency and the dullness begins to eat away at him until he develops insomnia. later on he meets up with a man named Tyler Durden, one of the best movie characters ever. They begin to cause all kinds of chaos to vent their frustrations on society.The writing is very captivating and crisp, and as the movie progresses I completely lost track of time and couldn't get up for anything until the movie was over and literally left me speechless.Some viewers may be confused about the message and the ideas presented will anger some, but it's still incredibly good and the most underrated movie ever.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Oh the sweet smell of subversive societal sweat!
",,"When Fight Club was released ...ahem... bestowed upon a generation so eager to see the lack of meaning in their lives, it felt like a veritable cinematic gift. And who was most eager to receive that gift? Frat boys! Meat heads! Athletic uber-tools! Confused males with no idea what to do with their testosterone or intelects could give a collective and resounding ""I get it!"" after declaring that this was their favorite film. And there was nothing wrong with that because this was not a disposable Michael Bay juggernaut of ejaculate. It wasn't even a Tarantino powerhouse of poised pulp! No, this movie was challenging! Unfortunately, as much as society's chode children loved it, they didn't get the message. They didn't get it like the anti-establiSHAM grim and grime enthusiasts got it. You see, there is a truly provocative, truly subversive message to this film that just sweats insight and bleeds truth. That message? Life is not Disneyland, people! Oh no! You thought life was sunny and fun? Get off your Donny Osmond douvee and stop drinking that Yoohoo! Life is a dark, bleak, damp mess and everything that doesn't come from IKEA smells like fecal matter. Fight Club shows us that in this day and age, life is so terminally f***t that finding a support group without a voluptuous obese man is as likely as buying soap that isn't made from human fat. Fat Club ...ahem... Fight Club shows us that in this world, the only truth you'll find is the truth behind a punch to the face ...or the truth between Meat Loaf's mammaries. Never before or since has there been a film that so effectively told us that our lives had no meaning. Except for maybe Twilight! Keep up the good fist, Fight Clubbers!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Order from chaos.
",,"""What's the thing that I want most? Where do I want myself to be 10 years from now? What is that goal whose accomplishment will make me die a happy man? It's certainly not a chic apartment with a fat paycheck (some of it, but not all of it). The point is that they are simply a means to contentment, not happiness itself.""These were my thoughts when I finished watching Fight Club. Jesus, what a movie. It took me a whole evening to shake of the hangover. I was so hooked on to the theme of the movie. Mayhem...anarchy...the point of no return...nothing to lose. It all seems too good to resist at first.However, after a while, I say to myself, ""Hey! What was I thinking? I need to snap out of it. It's just Hollywood. Over-glamorized stuff. Nothing but marketing nihilism and calling it art...."" No amount of convincing proves to be too good though. These was one of the things that was here to stay. A doubt and that irresistible desire to push everything off the edge. Even if it offered no solution. No promise to change things. No hidden messages. Everything lashed straight out. On the face. Raw and powerful. But superbly stylized all the same.That's Fight Club. 8.5/10.P.S. That's the second movie that gave me an overpowering urge to start working out. The first one was off course, Rocky.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Now at the top of my list
",spoiler,"This is the one. I saw it in the theaters at the ripe old age of 17, and was too blown away to fully process it. I've owned several copies of it since, and I've tried not to watch it too often so I can retain some fresh perspective when I do. This one isn't like the other movies. This one belongs in a different category, somewhere that serious-budget movies almost never dare to tread, but somehow, this was made. Between the stunning screenplay based on the fantastic book, and the amazing directing and basically perfect acting, there is no slack to even try to critique it as a normal film. It is inspired art. Some people will hate it. In fact, lots of people will hate it. Given the intelligence of the average consumer, that's the finest calling card I can imagine for a mainstream concept film.I'm a capitalist with an economics degree, so don't take this the wrong way, but this movie is the perfect assault on the concept of the economy being anything more than a means to an end, both critical and wary of the hollow, pathetic stupidity and vulnerability of the populace that has nothing better to do than participate in it and buy their hopes and dreams off the rack at Target. Even beneath this, the strong flavor of empowerment, Nietzsche-style, makes itself known with the charisma of the finest salesman and challenges everyone to find a better way. At once subverting society and subverting itself, the layered texture of the whole thing is probably too good for mass consumption. Well done. This one is now at the top of my list for best, and therefore most entertaining, films I've ever seen.

" Different and unique!!!
",spoiler,"David Fincher's Fight Club is one of the coolest films I have seen. It is fast-paced, well directed, well written and well acted. The pace of the movie is excellent. The average movie-goer may not understand it.What people don't see is the themes this film deals with. It deals with insomnia and the insanity of the protagonist. It is anti- society, anti- consumerism, anti- corporate companies and anti- today's lifestyle. I think The Narrator suffers from insomnia because he has to work a lot, something which is quite common these days. He is fed up of his lifestyle. He finds peace by visiting cancer groups. I think he is a bit like Travis Bickle: lonely, insomniac and insane. And just like Bickle, he becomes violent. I think it should be seen as a satiric thriller. That way it will be appreciated and understood better. Brad Pitt is excellent as Tyler Durden. I think his biggest strength is his ability to bring any character to life. He has done that in many of his films. Edward Norton also did very well and so did Helena Bonham Carter. The editing us top notch. The writing is excellent. Watch it. Strongly recommended.

" Original movie with a deep meaning
",,"This is one of the best movies I've ever seen. When I saw that this movie is among the best movies of all time I decided to watch it and I don't regret 2 hours spent watching this movie at all. The title is misleading, this isn't about fighting at all. Many people are disappointed by movie just because they hoped for more action or they thought that this movie is all about sweaty men fighting which they don't like. However, the whole Fight Club thing is just a side story. Actually, it's about nowadays values: Tyler, main character, wants to tell us that we just are wasting our lives doing crappy job which we don't even like so we can buy things we don't even need. He just wants to set people free by demolishing today's system. Tyler's thinking really differs from average person, but he is more free than anyone else. Narrator, the other main character, doesn't understand that, he's just everyman working in the office, but after meeting Tyler, he really tries to change. Once you understand what is this movie really about, you can't stop watching it. I watched it many times and I still find it interesting. What's more interesting that this isn't all, there is one major plot twist, which makes this movie a masterpiece.In conclusion, really enjoyed this film, recommend it for everyone else. It makes you think what the life is really about and what should we value.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Plight Club: in the end, it will be too late to stop it.
",,"There are two basic modes in which every animal (including human) lives its life. The first mode is characterized by security, safety, comfort, patience, defensiveness, caution, consolidation, inhibition, staidness, mildness, meekness, suppression, submission and conformity, whereas as a complete contrast the other mode is characterized by aggression, assertion, excitement, risk, initiative, boldness, spontaneity, impulsiveness, recklessness, violence and domination. Often the shift from the normal staid mode to the aggressive mode takes place very rapidly, even as small as a fraction of a second.Modern man has been forced by the need to attain social control of the masses to suppress the aggressive mode which was a necessary mode for the hunter-gatherer and warring man to survive and thrive. Today, most people have been programmed to live the staid life of a 9 to 5 routine, neatly dressed up, working to build a comfortable life, accumulating possessions that fortify this life style of maximizing luxury. But there is a downside to this: there is no sense of adventure left, it is a lifestyle of ultimate boredom because it is totally predictable, it leaves no room for a creative, innovative choice driven life style, and the mass aggressive outlet is in the contrived wars that dominating nations unleash upon the hapless smaller nations that dare to defy them even in the most trivial of issues. The only positive mass channeling of this aggression is in competitive sport or games, but come to think of it, that too is a contraption which is a distraction from the genuine aggressive response whose real value is in creativity.The other result of this suppression is in the development of a neurosis that leads to mental disorders, drug addiction, life of crime and ultimately an irresistible urge to destroy it all without even being consciously aware of it.Fight club is a story that vividly encapsulates this plight of modern, civilized man, the developing neurosis, the urges of aggression that are a response to boredom, the need for genuine excitement and adventure that are now a near impossibility, all build up to the inevitable destruction that is the only default genuine excitement that is left for man, an urge to destroy, that modern man is not even conscious of and will not be conscious of until the last moments of 'recorded time', and by that time it will be too late to stop it.""Perhaps only poetry had the strength to rival the attractions of narcotics, the magnetism of TV, the excitements of sex, or the ecstasies of destruction.""(Saul Bellow)",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""This is Jack's Post-Modern Masterpiece"" - Fight Club (1999): Blu-ray
",,"Who would have thought it? Marla Singer is the sanest, most honest person in the entire piece. Even through all her hypochondria and emotional rollercoasterism, she puts the cracked combination of Tyler Durden and ""Cornelius/Rupert/Everyman"" in its place. Revisiting David Fincher's fascinating post-modern masterwork Fight Club on Blu-ray for its 10th anniversary reveals a wealth of these kinds of previously undiscovered gems. What about Chloe, the dying woman so desperate for a last act roll in the hay that she advertises her various pleasure devices during her support group? There's Raymond K. Hessel, the freaked out liquor store clerk who becomes Tyler's first (of supposedly many) ""human sacrifices"" and, Lou, the faux Mafioso who gets a 'mouthful' of Fight Club's foul purpose. And of course, there's Robert Paulson, the big softy with ""bitch tits"" who ends up representing the most powerful of Project Mayhem's many ubiquitous symbols.Far beyond Edward Norton and Brad Pitt, who play the rebel yell yin yang of a split personality with revolutionary leanings better than any single actor ever could, and a director so in tune with the material that it seems to be flowing directly out of his own Id, it's great to see this adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's perturbing novel get the afterthought critical respect it so richly deserved (and yet missed) the first time. Yes, Messageboard Nation loves to rewrite the history books on all their favorite films, and to read their various rants on the subject, you'd swear this was 1999's most heavily praised and commercially successful film. In truth, the controversial nature of Fight Club's material - which many saw as a celebration of mindless violence and individual brutality - saw it as one of the decade's most divisive efforts. Only in hindsight did it become the black-eyed Mona Lisa.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Review of ""Fight Club""
",,"Ahh here it is. My review of David Fincher's classic adaption of Chuck Palahniuk's transgressional fiction master work. ""Fight Club"" tells the story of a corporate drone (Norton) who (like many) is displeased with his life. He, in turn, forms a 'fight club' with Tyler Durden (Pitt) a soap maker to escape from this sedative lifestyle. Now right off the bat, if this movie were shown to the original pioneers of film (i.e. Porter, Chaplin, Capra) I can safely say that upon completion of the film they would promptly scream, yell, cry, and then explode. . . .maybe. They would definitely be appalled by what they would see. However, this does not make ""Fight Club"" a bad film. For, film, like literature, can take on many forms and eventually evolve over time. Though the themes displayed throughout the film are definitely strange and at times shocking, they are also peculiarly thought-provoking and at times pragmatic. The movie's messages on defiance and nihilism are deeply rooted within it's very intelligently written script. The dialogue is hilarious and at times disturbingly provocative. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are two intensely talented actors, and seeing them work together on screen is really entertaining. Though anyone who watches this movie will walk out of the film talking about Brad Pitt's unforgettable portrayal of Tyler Durden. Pitt's obvious dedication to the role, paired with the near-perfectly written script he was given, makes for a character that I will quote many a time to come. Another aspect that I found particularly unique was the cinematography. I found that Photographic Director Jeff Cronenweth did a noteworthy job with the visuals of this movie. He really succeeded in using lighting to accentuate just how dismally somnolent the narrator's life is. I also felt that the use of lighting towards the end of the film was also very aesthetic. As for direction, David Fincher is . . . .well he's David Fincher. The guy really knows how to put a film together. In the end, ""Fight Club"" is a dark, dreary, appalling, hilarious film that I am glad to call a classic piece of American culture.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club
",spoiler,"In Fight Club, viewers are introduced to the nameless narrator played by Edward Norton, a man who has become numb for the knowledge of his being trapped within a structured, white-collar life. Things take an unexpected turn for the up when he chances to meet Tyler Durden, a mysterious, charismatic, and volatile individual who, with the narrator's help, creates an underground group to which many men begin to congregate like Christians to Sunday mass so to fight against one another in intense, free-form brawls; in short, a ""Fight Club."" However, the premise of this group is deceptively simple, and what begins as a means of connection and freedom between individuals soon spirals out of control into something much more sinister than the main character could have predicted.The movie places a heavy emphasis on consumerism, and does not cast the practice in a forgiving light: one scene has the main character detailing the list of items he orders from catalogs, and as he goes about enumerating his purchases the camera pans from left to right, filling out the nooks and crannies of his apartment with items that look as though they belong to the pages of a home decorating magazine. In another scene, the camera slowly retreats from inside a wastebasket, showing along the way discarded wrappers, cans, and various utensils manufactured by large, brand-name companies. In effect, the main character, as well as those men drawn to fight club, have been raised , as Tyler says, to ""work jobs we hate so we can buy s*** we don't need."" It is Tyler Durden who points this out to E.N.'s character, telling him: ""the things you own end up owning you,"" and from there on out the narrator is at Tyler's mercy, becoming but one of the many people swayed by his charming antagonism toward larger society. The cinematography and screen angling help to support his status as icon. All of the men in the film excluding Tyler Durden himself are average looking individuals who appear no different than from someone you might pass on the street. Tyler, in contrast, possesses rugged good looks and an Olympian body, and the film's shots make no attempt to hide this. In one scene, the narrator walks past Tyler having sexual intercourse with Marla (a woman who begins as much of a social vagrant as Edward Norton's character in the beginning before falling for Tyler's charm), and when Tyler pulls open the door to ask him what he is doing we are shown everything from just above his genitals and up; his narrow hips, his rock-like abdominals, his lean and granite-sculpted arms, his broad shoulders and chest. The lighting of the film is such that at any moment when Tyler's frame is seen, it is done so where the shadows work to the favor of his body's contours; whereas all the other men appear plain and average, everything of Tyler Durden, from his muscle tone, to his face, to his ostentatious clothing, is given room to shine; as such, he appears less like a human and more like a God, and at times, such as in one scene where he flurries his blood-streaked head back and forth like a feral dog, so that great globs of putrid scarlet are flying off his scalp, like a demon. The music of the film is almost scant; aside from the opening and ending credits, there are few moments in the film where music is a prime factor. The gritty nature of the film almost demands its absence, for many of the scenes are presented in so stark a setting that to pepper the mood with musical notes would only cheapen the effect. However there are some instances where music does indeed make its appearance, such as the scenes wherein the narrator explains to the audience the rapidity with which fight clubs begin to emerge throughout the country. The music at such times is simple yet catchy, and lends itself to the philosophy of the film well: Just because something is not complex does not mean it cannot take hold of you and, whether you realize it or not, drag you along for the ride—even if that ride involves you holding on for dear life, kicking and screaming.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club
",,"Fight Club shows that everyday life can be quite monotonous, but it is possible to exert your energy elsewhere when you are outside of the work place. The main actors and actress in Fight Club are Brad Pitt (Tyler Durden), Edward Norton (The Narrator) and Helena Bonham Carter (Marla Singer). Each of these individuals did an excellent job when it comes to reeling in their viewers. Throughout the movie a viewer's suspense level will increase due to the fact that they are unsure as to what Tyler will do next.The title of the movie represents the exact meaning of the film because Tyler creates a club of men that can fight against each other in order to exert their aggressions, which were brought on from a long day in the office. The club quickly catches on and explodes into every major city throughout the United States. This film shows how quickly anger can build up in a human being when they are stuck doing the same thing every single day of their lives.Another movie that most of you may be familiar with is Office Space, which is about a group of men that make a pact to change their everyday routine at work. The group of men scheme up a plan to plant a virus on their employer's computer system. While Fight Club is more violent than Office Space, they are both revolved around men that want some excitement in their lives. The lighting in Fight Club is mostly dark due to the fact that fight clubs are done behind closed doors for fear that they will be shut down if they are caught by the police. The lighting also helps in understanding how depressed an individual can become if there is no excitement or suspense in their lives. The variety of characters help to piece this film together for each of them complements each other quite well because they are completely different, but at the same time they have very similar characteristics.There are times when I feel as if my days run together because they are so repetitive. Finding new ways to change the repetitiveness can be difficult, but it is important to figure out what can be done in order to make everyday different. With this said, things can be changed by starting out with the opposite foot in which you take off walking with, carrying things in the other arm and driving a different way to and from work every day.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Worst Movie I ever Saw?
",,"That could possibly describe what this movie is. Awful! I know most of you will disagree with me but sorry it sucked. First off there is no acting in this movie. You could put any actors in place of Brad and Edward and it would be the same. But in my opinion neither of them should never win an Oscar anyway for any of their works. Second, what was going on? I mean I get the story of Edward trying to be someone else and all but it was told well at all. It was a very dark movie. Saying this is the best movie of all time makes me laugh. There is no way it can be. If you want to argue about this let me know.

I don't like Tom Cruise , he's not as nice as Brad but he sure is a great actor.This movie is all about violence, anarchy, annihilation. Why does anybody think blowing up a building, beating the crap out of each other, committing suicide is worth making a movie about .This is very irresponsible of the director, as this is what brought us Columbine, Virginia tech and massive killing, mayhem on a daily basis, how can all this be entertainment??

" Sordid Flick That AppealsTo Young Crowd
",spoiler,"Like ""The Sixth Sense,"" this is a film that has such a surprise ending that one almost needs to go back and see this again, from a different perspective. I can't say more without having to provide spoilers.This is a sick movie but I found it interesting in a perverse way. I am sorry so many young people love this movie so much because sordid and sleazy stories should not be so appealing.On the positive side, what I found most interesting was:(1) Pitt's character is totally without God but some of things he says about materialism sound really Biblical in nature. They were fascinating comments. (2) This film is stylishly-shot, a nice movie if you appreciate visuals as I do. (3) Edward Norton's narration was excellent.The characters in here are not clean-cut, high-ideal role models, to say the least. That includes Helena Bonham Carter's role in here. I couldn't take any of these people on the first viewing, but when a profanity filter was invented, I gave this another shot and the rating of the film was elevated from a 3 to a 6.5. Still, even with a filter, this is a bit too sleazy for middle-aged oldies like me. A sad comment that ""nasty"" seems to be so appealing to kids these days.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The most immoral film I have ever seen
",,"I am 34, I have seen thousands of films, and this is unquestionably the absolute worst. It is evil. Technically well done, but evil still. This film shits on every value I hold dear : honesty, hard work, liberty of thought, non-violence, respect of others as equals, reason as my best tool to make something of my life. It glorifies senseless destruction of property and (which is much, much worse) of able minds in cult-like brainwashing to serve egoistical means. Every problem should be overcome with violence, lies, or blackmail. Every man who is not you is there to be used or beaten into a pathetic degenerate. There is no respect of the other. Also, the ""plot twist"" had me wincing.

" One of Norton's best, year too
",,"Chuck Palahniuck's Fight Club is a exciting, stimulating and surprising look at a typical macho porn (coincidence to porn, at the end of the movie, look real close for Brad Pitt's d***).  The movie circles around a man (a usual great performance by Ed Norton, who plays this man but is only know as narrator) who has a dead-end job and life until he meets a man played by Tyler Durden (played well by Brad Pitt) who convinces him that the best way to live is to beat each other senseless.  Soon a club starts, and a type of fascist society of fighting men are abound.  This film takes many turns, many odd ones at that, but it is cool, action packed, and sometimes even funny.

" A dark, intriguing and haunting film about.... NOTHING!!!
",spoiler,"So, there was once a loser, a guy who is so depressed and alienated by society and his job that he has to join different self-help groups, even though he does not suffer from the conditions of the attendants, just to find some human warmth. Suddenly an unfortunate incident leaves him homeless, and he turns to a recently met friend for help. This means a dramatic change in his life, his friend is handsome, strong, full of self-confidence, charismatic, bold, audacious, that is, just the opposite from him, and the one he would maybe like to become. And his friend opens for him a sort of liberation path, through fight!, the most basic and primitive of human instincts; first between them, then starting a club of fighters who meet every week to release their life frustrations through violence and direct hand-to-hand combat. The other most primitive human instinct, sex, appears abruptly too, but it's not him, but his friend whom becomes the sex partner of the girl he likes. Most of the film time is spent in the development of the fight club, which gets bigger, with some of its members going to live to the friend house (much to the displeasure of the protagonist), and then finally turning into a sort of protest/sabotage/terrorist group.And suddenly his friend disappears, and in his search for him the protagonist discovers that his friend founded many other fight clubs in other cities. And here the ""great"" moment of the film comes!... the protagonist discovers that his friend is actually... himself!!, it is a fictional personage created by his own mind, the person he would like to be, the embodiment of his ambitions, of everything he admires... and hates all at once, the fictional being through whom he takes revenge on the senseless world he lives in. And thus we are forced to completely change our perspective and interpret the whole story under a totally new point of view, and it is just then when we realize the story we have been told is about.... NOTHING AT ALL!!!.... liberation through violence and sex?? oh yeah! we might believe that if the end of the film showed us something different from a guy meekly pleading his lady to come back with him, something different form a guy horrified at the tragical consequences the acts of violence he has promoted have had. Regret from having departed so much from the established social order?? it just does not make sense.Then we start to think of the internal coherence of the story, and we find so many plot holes and so much inconsistency that the whole film literally deflates into nothing but a bunch of senseless violent scenes and a ridiculously pretentious and void criticism-against-the-system message.Probably one of the most overrated films at IMDb, a perfect example of a film which should have never been made.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Negative
",,"I think the movie is worth 2 or 3 at most.What the whole movie really brought to the viewers is a mass of violence, destruction, illogic, impossibility and obscurity.I am not going to describe the violence and destruction here because everyone can easily understand what I am talking about. These things are obvious. I want to point out the latter three.First, if a person don't know how to create explosives, how come after becoming a psycho he/she can? ...illogical and impossible. Second, without Brad Pitt, how could a fight club exist? ...illogical. Third, what did the other members of the fight club do to earn a living? They appeared as jobless or tramps. ...impossible and obscure. Actually there are other points I am tired of pointing out.If all these things are good in our world, what is the bad?

" ""We have front row seats for this theater of mass destruction"".
",spoiler,"There's a not so subtle irony in the premise of this picture that managed to intrude on my consciousness about the time I learned about Strinne green stripe patterns. Society's obsession with material goods has a dehumanizing effect on the individual, leading some to destructive behavior in an attempt to rid the shackles of mindless adherence to a herd mentality. Whenever this idea is presented in a commercial venture however, it itself falls victim to a form of circular logic. The success of the film depends on it's ability to denigrate itself as a form of commercial enterprise or achievement. The same can be said of the principal players; I highly doubt that Brad Pitt or Ed Norton go around bemoaning the fact that their wealth is somehow an obstacle to their self worth as human beings. There's an element of hypocrisy in all this, but I won't begrudge the actors or director for their part in it. They're trying to make a statement in a unique way, and often have to deliver a punch to the gut to get there.By the way, if you're paying attention, a clue to the identity of the narrator comes early when Tyler Durden (Pitt) opines on his views of life and mentions those same Strinne green stripe patterns. That line jarred me about as much as it did Ed Norton's character; the look on his face at that moment betrayed a moment of introspection that would be revealed at the end of the story. That was actually a clever clue planted by director Fincher, because the odds of two different people coming up with the exact same concept about home furnishing options defies probability.The troubling aspect about the film, aside from it's message however, is the glorification it seems to convey upon a youth culture bent on a form of self destruction. You see it in the copy cat rise of actual fight clubs in the wake of the picture, along with other forms of physical mayhem like extreme wrestling. One doesn't absorb the pain in real life quite as nobly as Tyler did while mocking the garage owner. But I guess some will only learn the hard way.Hey, did you catch that newspaper clipping that mentioned the street violence that was occurring after the fight club concept gained prominence - 'Missing Monkeys Found Shaved'. I wonder if there were twelve of them.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Is there some deep meaning I'm not getting?
",spoiler,"Before we start, I should tell you all that I have actually only seen this movie one, and that was around a year and a half ago, so I am mostly going on memory. Also there will be spoilers.Is Fight Club a good film? Yeah...there's really nothing bad about it's plot or anything. Is Fight Club and Overrated film? In my opinion...yes. Sorry, I know there are a lot of people who absolutely love this film, but it is currently number 14 on the IMDb top 250.OK, first off, this movie does look really good, it has a gritty look to it that matches the tone of the film perfectly. And yes, I did really like the twist ending, I never saw that coming. However there are two really big pet peeves about this movie that get to me, and really brought this movie down hill.One problem is this: What is this movie trying to say? Don't tell me this is just supposed to be a popcorn movie, this movie is trying to say something, but I'm still not sure what. Is fighting good? Is fighting Bad? Can severe depression lead you to do a lot of crazy stuff? Are children films becoming to sexual (insert Mr. Poppers Penguin joke here.)? I guess the big question it tries to raise is what will happen if the US economy started over, but I'm still not sure that was even the question it brought up.My second big problem was the ending, and this is where the spoilers will be in full force. Now this movie tries really hard to be realistic, which for most of the movie it does really well. But after Tyler is revealed to be in the main character's mind, the movie sort of gives up.How does shooting yourself in the mouth get rid of Tyler? And how do you survive a shot to the mouth, you don't, and even if you did, you be in way too much pain to talk. Also I'm not an expert on the economy, I know very little on how the nations' economy works, but I'm pretty sure that destroying half of New York City, the city that controls the nations economy wouldn't start everyone over, it would screw us more. Isn't that what the terrorist were trying to do on 9/11. So basically, the characters in this film caused an event that was even worse than 9/11. Think how many people must of died, even if the bulding were empty the smoke, the debris, it must have made one hell of a mess. Basically, the Fight Club is worse than Al Queda.I'm still gonna dwell on this. Where did they get that many bombs. They would literally need thousands of bombs per building. They came down in seconds.OK, maybe I'm being too hard, maybe the writer thought that bombs would work. But wait didn't a terrorist group try to bring down a the twin towers with bombs in 1993? And they failed.OK, I think that's about it, there are some small nitpicks I have, but the questionable moral and the ending just completely made me forget. Fight Club is good, if you love the movie, good for you, but I will not be buying it any time soon.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" The Best Movie Ever Made
",,"When I entered IMDb.com the first thing I did was to check if anyone actually disliked this movie. And YES, there are people who gave the movie one star. This is a proof that every movie can be disliked by SOMEONE in the world, because Fight Club is with no argument the best movie ever made. It's the best combination of a great writer, great director, great actors, great music makers. And the outcome is a movie which needs to be watched 7-8 times to understand it. I watched it probably more than 8 times, and I still discover something new in the movie. Maybe a hidden frame, or an important word or sentence which I couldn't understand before. The enjoyment you'll get by watching it once is limited. You will like the movie more and more every time u see it and finally think it is the best movie ever made. There's no end to depth of the movie. And to my surprise, for the first time I see a movie is BETTER than its novel. The script writer took the novel, converted it into a movie script removing the boring and dull parts, and made it ready for an outstanding movie. This is actually why u need to watch it several times, because EVERY word, EVERY sentence has a meaning and no time and no line is wasted in the movie.If you're a movie lover, you have probably seen this movie. My advice is, watch it again, and again, and again...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

But then, I should have known better....Having been a great fan of Edward Norton from his 'Red Dragon' days, I know that he has a peculiar taste in selecting films. His movies are anything but ordinary.The climax of course turned everything up side down and I slipped from the chair and rolled over...Nothing I say will ever fully describe how I felt.

" One of the best flicks in the world.
",,"When I first saw Fight Club I was 11 years old, and after seeing it at that age I thought it sucked, mainly due to confusing story, and me not being English I couldn't really make much out of it, hence the hateful attitude I got for the movie.However, after seeing it again several years later, and then once more when I'm 18, I first noticed what a true masterpiece this movie is. Norton and Pitt simply ace their roles by far, and show that they both are world class actors.Not all credit goes to them, as the movie is very good by itself, and the great acting only boosts the score. It's masterpiece, and one of the absolutely best movies in the world, ever, seriously.Honestly I cannot understand why Fight Club 2 hasn't come out, but then again, it might destroy the first one because it's that good, and I don't think the producer would want that, and it'd most likely take a lot to get to those standards set.If you want to see Norton and Pitt at their best when it comes to their acting skills, then look no further, this is it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Great movie
",spoiler,"""Fight Club""A choice of film to watch has to be Fight Club directed by David Fincher in 1999. Narrator that has no name in this is played by Edward Norton and Brad Pitt (Tyler Durden) is the narrator's friend. The film is not only entertaining, but made the film brilliantly made from the start to finish. The narrator changes personality making the transition from one end of the scale to the other without letting the viewers realize it.First, as the movie start off with computer generated, also known as CG, view of something out of ordinary where it doesn't seem of any sort. As it goes along it shows something like cells with electric vibe bouncing one to the other. The film follows the electric passing through cells leading way out of a human head with detailed sweat. When camera comes out into the air, it travels through a gun barrel backwards. The film starts out at a violent point of the film, but this wasn't the case as narrator starts talking; than, the movie jumps out and starts at a point when narrator first met a man named Rob from rehab. Then again, he stopped and starts out further back. It sounds as if the movie was made horribly. Viewers are scratching their heads with confusion as to how the movie will start-off.Second, the movie has jumped in sequence of no purpose of chronological order in sense, but now narrator is introducing himself with his problems and what he does for living. It was rather interesting type of person. Film captured certain picture in the background of a person flashing. The picture has meant something as it co-relates to what the main character is feeling at the time. Now, the narrator is taking the advantage of going to rehab where he met Bob. That particular scene, film shuts-off all aspects in the background and focuses what's at hand, which the group of people in rehab sharing the deepest problem in their lives.Third, as the film rolls, Narrator met a man named Tyler Durden. Well edited to follow along with the narrator. Narrator was driven by Durden to be the other personality that he is. Fight scenes of them together is a persona of fighting-within. Making an organized crime of underground fight club is a replacement of rehab. Director had a profound way of intertwining narrator's insomnia and personalities. Film has a good sense of capturing the two person together along to the end.Finally, film gets back into the beginning of film. The scene jumped back at gun point. Picture was gloomy in the background where the building was; in such, there was catastrophic thing happening at the end. To resolve on own self was to shoot himself in the head by killing Tyler Durdan. The movie had an interesting way of interacting with the two characters. A well edited film!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" no Exit
",,"When watching a movie what sets it apart from other films? is it its style, its story, characters, moral or message?I like style, but when the rest sucks, it feels like a designer cupboard with no space to put something in, and you're left with something nice to look at but with no use... Well fight club is A DESIGNER CUPBOARD with plenty to put in.First of all the visuals are stunning and top notch all of them.Colours are balanced the editing is clever and well placed, wardrobe and settings all urban,beautifully realistic without glamorizing its emptiness or its decay. This is what ""we"" live in, everyday.Then there's the story and its messages and morals...frustration, boredom, emptiness and the feeling of being the 2nd born in history...no direction to go, but to go ahead in a society that takes all but doesn't leave but the option of being a customer, a lifestyle obsessed doing jobs we hate copping things we don't need.Break out, start a revolution, don't give a damn, and become... Tyler Durden. Smart, witty, good looking and willing to sacrifice anything for point zero. Don't hold on, let go...what makes you ain't got no use at all. Don't solve nothing...for what anyway? Learn society and learn how to trick it, learn how to live without it, give up all be free and survive on its edge.

" Blunt, important and stylish -- not just a guy's movie
",,"""Rule number 1 of Fight Club: You do not talk about Fight Club.""Satirical, entertaining, bold, challenging and heavily stylized. Usually if a film has one of these qualities it is a good accomplishment. But David Fincher' acclaimed Fight Club (1999) has all of them, thereby cementing its status as upcoming cult in cinema. This is an important film that bravely plunges into the exploration of human issues like violence and depression, and that does so with flair and fury. It also sprinkles good doses of humour onto its final product, making Fight Club an enjoyable ride.Edward Norton is a thirty year old office worker, lazily frozen in a comatose state of ordering IKEA furniture and getting hounded by his boss. What takes him and shakes him is the arrival of Tyler Duren (Brad Pitt) who introduces him to a subculture of anarchy and a club called 'Fight Club'.Fight Club is an extremely graphic, violent and blunt portrayal of society and it looks into human nature. While Edward Norton's character as 'The Narrator' is an extreme case study, we all recognise aspects of his life and the thoughts in his head. The only problem as far as I'm concerned are the actors. You can never get away from the 'Pitt factor' in Brad Pitt's performance and it is often distracting. Edward Norton's narration often feels flat and emotionless. This would have been very appropriate in the beginning of the film, but as it progresses and he begins to feel more alive, his lifeless tone drags down the quality.This wouldn't make my top 20, but it'd probably make my top 30 list.8/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" More than a great movie
",,"A movie about enlightenment, discovering and using the primal power within, and making your life better, not by building up what you don't have, but by destroying the things in your life that do not truly matter. Fight Club also has very clever humor, and a decent love story that won't make you cry but won't make you laugh either. Fight Club discusses the hidden harm caused by consumerism and being a slave to a market-based society. Not only a great movie, but therapeutic to many who feel trapped by the unnecessary rules and standards of their society. This movie is a wake up call for anyone and everyone out there who works a job they hate so they can buy sh*t they don't need.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" This is your life and it's ending one minute at time. A MASTERPIECE!
",,"This is an incredible movie. I've seen ""fight club"" when it was released in 1999; stunned by that movie i read the novel by Chuck Palahniuk, and i've discovered an incredible writer too. It's too complicated to describe a movie like this. It's a crude, realistic, nihilistic vision of our lives, our crisis, our world filled with clichés, with media that tell you how you must be, how you must act, how you must live. It's not only a fighting movie at all. It's about deconstructions, about pain, about the use of a struggle to feel human again. The acting from Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are great here. Both seems to dive like a fish in their roles, and the character of Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) is simply flawless. From beginning to the end the movie caught you in an alienated, but incredibly real web of a twisted mind, struggling for freedom, raging against everything. I can't tell anything more 'cause i'll ruin the atmosphere of the flick... The novel it's great too (like all others works by Chuck). The movie is almost identical to the book, apart for the end. In conclusion i consider ""Fight Club"" one of the deepest, darkest and twisting movie of the decade. It's a masterpiece and you must see it at least once, and if you think i must have my head examined, well, you've totally missed the point!!! You wont be disappointed, i can assure you that!!! 10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A High Schooler's Dream
",,"I saw this movie late one night on HBO my junior year in high school. I bought it the next day and probably saw it 25 times that week. This was the first movie I ever saw that gave me reason to believe movies could be more than entertaining or heart warming. Movies could say something intelligent. Of course, the fact that this is one of the most entertaining movie's EVER only makes the watcher want to listen to what it says all that much more. And despite it's presentation and even content, it does say good things.I won't talk, at least that much, about how amazing Pitt, Norton, and Carter are. I won't focus on the twist that no one ever sees coming and yet makes so much sense. Even without the twist, the movie would have become a classic. I won't talk about the interesting homoerotic themes, and I won't go on about how this is the modern western. Let's talk about the book instead.I'll say it. The movie is better. While the book obviously made the movie possible, the movie is an improvement, a realization. Even Palahniuk says so concerning the end. A difficult story to put on film, but the effort was not in vain. Just as harsh, just as (and I hate this word) unflinching, the book may actually be a bit clumsy, things about beaches and Marla's mother really aren't necessary or even interesting. The grittiness of the movie is superior to anything I could have imagined, and I have an okay imagination.I mean it, that this is a high schooler's dream. Having never even imagined things like Nihilism or self sustained living or even the virtue of pain, this film was eye opening. This movie hits like a brick, and you want it to keep hitting. Oh, and it's super quotable.It's embarrassing to say, but this movie shaped me to some extent. I saw it at an age where I could have easily grown into conformity, or I could have begun to question and challenge everything. Fight Club instills a sense of responsibility and urgency in it's audience. It's my very favorite movie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Best Movie of ALL TIME
",,"In a decade of unoriginality this movie breaks ground in a way that makes the mind do it's job. As if the twist and turns weren't enough, Chuck Palahniuk (the author of the book) and Jim Uhls (screen play), create an aura of a motivational dementia. With discipline, a man can learn a great deal from this movie. It serves as a reminder of just how crooked the human condition has become, as we strive for perfection through means of materialism and we look for humanity in commercialism.As for the actors, what can I say!? I feel a real loss of masculenity when I say Brad Pitt is one of my favorite actors, but this movie highlights his excellent acting abilities. Edward Norton, star of previous movies such as The Rounders, American History X and the Italian Job, does an amazing job as a complacent unity of society.

" bad -- very bad
",,"This is one of the silliest movies I have ever seen.It is not only not credible that such clubs exist; the motivation of the characters in this film to act the way they do is simply not believable.Having said that the performances are quite good. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton always deliver consistent well rounded performances. It is unfortunate that their efforts are wasted here due to an unsatisfactory script and an incredible plot line.The ending of the film is especially unsatisfying and .... well, weird. I guess one should have expected that from the lengthy period of grief that precedes it. The performances probably rate more than a 2 rating, but I think it deserves a rap on the knuckles just in case someone wants to make Fight Club II",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" absolute genius
",,"this film is one of the films that has already become a classic and will only go to grow in stature as the years go on. it is an amazing film which is so cleverly written. the twists are thoroughly unexpected and all the acting is amazing. the roles seem to have been written with brad Pitt and Edward Norton in mind. the soundtrack is very fitting and the direction is worthy of some kind of accolade. even the camera tricks and cgi are well used whereas in some films they can ruin it. it stands up to repeated re-watchings and in fact is more appreciated after repeated watchings. the idea of setting up a cathartic underground boxing club seems to be a bit far-fetched yet the brilliance of the writing means that you never question the credibility of the film. all in all this is a dark, funny, heavy, intelligent film that will change your outlook on life",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The impact of Fight Club
",spoiler,"The first time I had seen this movie I came back thinking of how stupid this film I had just seen was. But then by a twisted chance of fate I had the gifted pleasure to see it again and I had finally gotten the plot and all the little twists and turns. Now I became as Tyler had said ""adicted."" Every time I finish watching this mind-numbing film (no matter how many times I have seen it) I have a sense that I have witnessed the absolute of what a movie should be. I swear if you watch this movie enough you could become a master in psychology. I agree with every one else when I say that Fight Club is the most underrated film in the history of film making. If everyone in the United States or the World for that matter had seen this movie this whole place would have a different outlook on life. Maybee to some of you reading this I may sound obsessed and I probably am but only because I think that this movie depicts the way that I think life should be. It shows how we are all in some kind of little womb that we are afraid to leave because of what we may find on the outside, but some go for it and are revealed to the possibility's of what true freedom in complete chaos.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Surpassed my expectations to become my favourite film
",spoiler,"The first rule about Fight Club is you do not talk about Fight Club! But I have to, I really have to tell people just how much I enjoyed this film. Totally not what I thought it was going to be, the film is actually more psychological than it is action and even though there is violence, it never really feels gratuitous or ""testosterone filled"" like some movies do.The plot, which is from the book of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, follows a young man (Edward Norton) who spends his evenings hiding away in support groups for conditions he does not have, that is until he meets Tyler Durdan (Brad Pitt). Tyler introduces the narrator to an underground world of Fights, secrets, and revenge against society at large.I fell in love with Brad Pitt from this film. His role is both charismatic and frightening at the same time, and he is totally believable. By this I mean he doesn't ham it up like I expect some actors would in such a powerful role.Edward Norton once again does not disappoint, with his occasionally humorous deadpan approach to the narration and again natural performance that truly brings you into the shoes of the everyman character he portrays.My biggest surprise was Helena Bonham Carter, who I almost didn't recognise she was so different from anything I've ever seen before, brilliant.The direction is different to what you would normally see. The visuals communicate the plot in more ways than one, and really bring out the energy of the fight scenes.To say anything about the ending will give away the plot, except that the ending will surprise you. This is a film that you really need to see twice to get the full story from, but it is worth it (as is the book BTW).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The Best Film Ever Made....

He lives out the role of what any man would wish he could do. Says the things all men just wish they could say and lives the way we wouldn't dream of but still makes it look cool.The storyline itself is so great. I mean a bunch of guys who get together to fight. And then these guys start a whole new plan which is so cool.I hope this film is a favourite of any movie fan because i simply love it. I don't wanna spoil it, it's just a film you have to see to believe.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Love it or Hate it, it is different!
",spoiler,"I just watched Fight Club this week, I'd been avoiding it, mostly because I just had convinced myself I wouldn't like it. In fact, I was sure I'd hate it. OK-here goes-BOY WAS I WRONG! This movie is really really different, obviously very well made and now that I've seen it I can understand why it's ranked so high on the IMDb top movies of all time.Not to say I thought it was perfect. I did, as expected, have a problem with all the violence but that I expected and doesn't take away from the well written intelligent script, much in the same way as the Kill Bill movies which I felt the same way about. In fact, Fight Club reminded me of Kill Bill, not because the stories had any similarity whatsoever but because of the fact that their both violent, both (for lack of a better term) completely out there!, yet both very gritty and extremely intelligent. So yeah I liked Fight Club. I've read dozens of reviews on here and many mention plot and how it's one of the best movies ever made etc-so I wont even go there. What I will say is that Norton and Pitt are wonderfully matched on screen and I cannot imagine these two roles being played by anyone else. Were there ANY Oscar nominations for this movie? I don't seem to remember any which is a shame. Pitt's best role to date and maybe Norton's as well. I will say I can see where this maybe liked more by men then women. Most females I know have not and do not want to see this while most of the guys I know have seen it or plan to at some point. This movie should have been promoted in a different way because to many people think it's about nothing more then boxing and men beating each other up and that turns a lot of people off. Anyway:I admired Fight Club, I thought it was bizarre and frightening in a way and can see similarities to many movies from Clockwork Orange to Lord of the Flies. My one complaint is something that I haven't seen brought up a lot.SPOILER ALERT: I had a bit of a problem with the ending. I mean, as odd as this movie was, it wasn't over the top to the point where you roll your eyes or anything. But at the end when Norton shoots Tyler and it seems he has gotten rid of him and everything is gonna be OK... I was a bit baffled because if there was anything this movie wasn't, till that point, it was ""feel good"", and that was my thought about the ending. I mean Norton's character had multiple personality disorder and all of a sudden he was over it like that? When Tyler had been such a big part of him for so long. Now it is possible I misinterpreted the ending(I've been on the message boards and everyone seems to have a different theory about what the ending really meant.) But that really did bother me since that is a pretty serious thing and it seemed a little unrealistic the way it was done but hey this is a movie.Anyway, I still don't know if I'd rank this in the top 35 movies of all time but I have no problem understanding how this could be someone's favorite movie, it was very well done and is probably the type of movie any film school student should study(though I could also see how this wouldn't be for everyone). I'd give it an 8.5 out of 10. And I'll say it again, Pitt and Norton-both should have been nominated, great performances.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A radical, dark film presenting new standards in narration
",,"No doubt, Fight Club is one of the best films of the decade and it deserves its overwhelming good reputation. Edward Norton plays his second-best role after his terrific performance in American History X and Brad Pitt does best in dark and bizarre films so he is absolutely right in Fincher's masterpiece. From the beginning it becomes clear that this is no film for people who just want to relax in their seat with some popcorn and a cola trying to spend a smooth evening. You really have to think and this is what makes it a good film. A man is frustrated about his life and searches for something completely different. Honestly, that's not a very new idea but Fincher is able to give it a new direction. He radicalizes his characters and shows brutality in a direct and uncovered way. The perversion of society gets a face in Tyler Durden and the ones who follow his ""new way"". The narration is what impressed me most. Who are absolutely shocked when you have to realize that Tyler is not the one he seems to be... To give a conclusion: Not my favourite, but a very, very good film!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" What did I wait for?
",,"I have finally got around to seeing this movie, and after all its hype and all its acclaim, I'm pleased to say it's deserving of it it all. I have gone out of my way to avoid this film for almost 5 years, often watching far inferior films instead, and now i have seen it, i can't think why?Edward Norton (Jack) is an insomniac who seeks solace in joining help groups for cancer, blood disorders, etc. and his addiction for them grows the more he attends. That is until he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and they form their own help group (FIGHT CLUB) where grown men can join and beat each other up to forget their troubles. And so an underground sect is formed, as Jack and Tyler's ideas spread like the plague, Jack soon realises that all is not quite what it seems.Brilliantly directed, and solid performances from all the cast, Fight Club is an undoubted winner, packed with action, slick dialogue, comedy, violence and much more.9/10 What are you waiting for - SEE IT!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" One of a kind movie.
",,"There never has been a movie like ""Fight Club"" before and there never will be again.""Fight Club"" is a great movie mixture of a great story, acting and style. Movies that have all those elements are rare and often a great and one of a kind movie.Director David Fincher's directing works effective. It gives the movie both style and substance with a lot of depth. The story makes you want to see the movie over and over again, so you can understand and discover some more things on every viewing.Both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt do a great acting job, although I probably wouldn't have picked Pitt as a leading character. His role comes too soon after his in ""Twelve Monkeys"", both the movie and his character show resemblances. Meat Loaf has a fun role as Bob with the big man-breasts.The story is way more different than you would most likely expect. When you are first watching this movie you expect it to be a fight movie with street boxing. This is not the case, ""Fight Club"" is a personal movie in which the main focus lies on the main character and the anti-society message much like in Kubrick's movies was the case.Highly recommendable movie, although not a classic or masterpiece in my book.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I felt like I was left hanging at the very end, wondering what's next, but then again, I've only seen it once.

" A film about our generation.
",,"Well what can I say? This film is amazing. It has everything that an MTV generation boy or girl could want, all neatly packaged in this gem of a movie. I must say the book was amazing, I loved it, it really gave some fresh ideas to life, and why we act the way we act. But i feel the movie is a better medium in which to show this to mass audience. First things first, every actor in this film is marvellous, a joy to watch. Edward Norton is God, when it comes to really nailing a character and slipping into a role, he is close to DeNiro. Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf and Jared Leto all are a pleasure to watch. But I must say this film is about one man, Tyler Durden... ladies and gentlemen... Brad Pitt rocked in this. I could never possibly imagine anybody else in this role, he magnificently slips into a potentially hypocritical role, looking good and acting the part, my hats off. What makes this film so great, naturally the twist is always important and a real brain teaser, is just how glorious it is after you realize the truth. On second viewing you pick up more details, the tiniest of things that just make the film worth watching over and over again. But most important is its visual flare. It is as if we are in the mind of Jack the narrator - take your pick] The constant jumping back, going forward, skipping to and throw, picking up were he left off, it represents beautifully what a modern mans life is like, full of constant hectic day to day monotomous work routines, all becoming slaves to the fashion and food industry, as if image were really the most important aspect in life. This is a rant on capitalism, and all the better for it, me and my friends enjoy it particularly for that reason, because it laughs in the face of democracy, not in an attempt to [as some American critics failed to understand] promote Fascism as an idealised movement, but just to stand there and say ""Hey this is what's wrong, I don't like this and that, F**k you and your rules, lets do something worth living about."" It really tunes into modern perceptions of life: Work, Sex, Fashion, Religion and Security... and just really mixes them around. I came out of the cinema bedazzled by the whole look of the film, but watch it again and enjoy it for what it really has to offer... everything.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The best film ever made!
",,"Where to begin? I loved Fight Club, along with many other people, and I would recommend it to anyone who has an 'open mind' and does not get offended easily. Fight Club had a dark feel, with very black comedy and a touch of mystery.Fight Club is about one man's journey through a weird part of his life. He (Edward Norton) has a good job working for a car company, he has nice IKEA furniture in his nice little condo. He was almost a complete man. Until, his condo explodes while he is away and he looses everything he owned. So, he rings Tyler (Brad Pitt), an acquaintance he made on a plane on one of his business trips. He goes and has a few beers with Tyler. After they finish they come out of the pub and Tyler asks him to hit him as hard as he can. After some hesitance he does, Tyler hits him back and they fight the night away. They get a buzz from fighting and that's how Fight Club starts. I won't give anything away but the story twists and turns ways you could never imagine.What made Fight Club so great was a combination of many different people doing a great job.  The novel buy Chuck Palahniuk was brilliant and I personally thought that it could never be brought to the screen and be as good as the book. But, Fight Club exceeded its limits and went a step further with a great screenplay by Jim Uhls, without the great screenplay the film would have flopped. Then there is the extraordinary acting all around, it was undoubtedly Edward Norton's, Helena Bonham Carter's and Brad Pitt's best performance ever and other small roles were played well too, such as Meat Loaf, playing Bob. And of coarse, last but not least, David Fincher. David exceeded all expectations making Fight Club. The film was given the prefect feeling thanks to David's precise direction, if you listen to the commentary and see all the extra features on the DVD you will be sure to know how much effort David put into Fight Club to give it the perfect feel, just like the book.Overall, Fight Club gives us some very strong messages, but I thing the very essence of the film is to take what you want from it. This is a must see for everyone, because in my opinion this is the best film ever made and you will most probably enjoy it. If you don't like it, watch it a second time, it will likely change you opinion. A definite: 10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Methods of Mayhem
",,"""Fight Club"" is a movie born to let people discuss. It can be considered a masterpiece of the modern times (as I did) or a stupid and excessive movie. The story is told us by an anonymous Narrator (symbol of the every man), which is disappointed by his life and find comfort visiting people affected by cancer. Then he meets two dropouts like him: the strange Marla Singer (Helena Bonham carter, dressed like a scarecrow) and the fascinating Tyler Durden, which involves him in an hurricane of violence and anarchy. And the Narrator doesn't know how to stop him and himself. The story begins with a fantastic introduction in the false - golden life of the narrator, affected by insomnia and depression and it is like a shout for freedom in a society trapped by herself in the logic of ""making money"". Tyler founds an organization called Mayhem to destroy all the false symbols of a life untrue and makes little acts of terrorism, introducing frames of porn movies in movies for children. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton gives two astonishing performances: the first is fantastic in denying his image of sex-symbol for an acting voted to destruction, the second, the normal man willing to revolt to society, is one of the best actors of 2000.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" ""What is Fight club?"" It's one of the best movies of the year.r
",,"There isn't really a way to tell you exactly what ""Fight club"" is.  Some might say it's a black-comedy, others might call it a social drama, others, a social comedy.  I'm not sure which of those adjectives describe the movie best but the adjective ""One of the 5 best movies of the year"" sure qualifies.  Another one would be ""One of Norton's best performance's ever"". In fact, it's probably his best after the one he gave in ""American history X"".  And yet another way to qualify it would be ""By far David Fincher's best movie yet"".  Yes, ""Fight club"" is an excellent movie and true entertainment. Plus, there are great performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, Helena Bonham Carter and Meat Loaf and great direction by David Fincher.The story is narrated by Edward Norton whose name seems to be Jack although he is never called like that by anyone leaving us in doubt.  He explains how he thought his life was a total bore and how he joined certain groups like groups for people with testicular cancer just to make friends. This is where he meets Bob (Meat Loaf) and befriends him.  However, at some point, he sees a woman named Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) in all those groups and guesses she has none of the problems the people attending the reunions have.  However, Jack doesn't either.  So they make a deal so that they do not meet again:  every week, they go to she goes to certain groups while he goes to other groups so they won't see each other.Weeks go by without anything really happening and one day, on a plane, Jack meets a man who calls himself Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt).  Tyler sells soap for a living.  After the plane lands, the two men each go their own way but when Jack gets home, he sees that his apartment has been blown-up and decides to call Tyler to ask him if he might have a free bed at his house. They decide to go to a bar and after three pitchers of beer, they are approaching the bar's closing time and go outside.  This is when, out of the blue, Tyler asks Jack to hit him.  The two men finally end up fighting for real and seem to get some kicks out of it and after a while, they decide to form a fight club whose two principal rules are ""You do not talk about Fight club"".The movie starts off right in the action and never lets the viewer down. Jim Ulhs's screenplay is excellent.  David Fincher also uses a few slow motions to add a certain intensity to the scene.  The music by the Dust brothers is excellent and the other songs used are excellent as well. However, as good as everything about this movie is, nothing beats Edward Norton's performance.  He is simply incredible.  Over here in Canada, the movie got the harshest rating which is ""18 and over"" and did deserve because although there isn't only violence in this movie, it is very graphic and depicted as it is just when it happens to a person.  Also, the violence shown is especially during the fights and no one dies in these fights. It isn't for the faint-hearted and has a disappointing ending but if you can get to gather all the courage you have to watch this one, you'll see you'll be glad you saw it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" what I thought films should be

Surprising,frightening,visually stunning,soundwise top notch(I'm an audio engineer and boy would I like to know about those impact sounds) and acting so good, I didn't doubt the characters at any time. Clever plot, no unnecessary shots anywhere and chock full of humor too.If you don't mind the violence,which is realistic to a frightening degree, go out and watch this.

" Yet Another Victim Of Keyser Soze Disease
",,"Edgy, disturbing, and hard-hitting in places, `Fight Club' is a decent film that fails to ultimately live up to its initial promise.  With a devious, deftly handled opening half-hour, it's actually quite shocking how clumsy and awkward the later stages of `Fight Club' become.  It's almost as though director David Fincher so desperately wants the audience to get the point of his film, he's willing to beat the audience of the head with that point - and by doing so, the message of `Fight Club' gets lost.The film opens with the unnamed Narrator (Edward Norton), a despairing young man who's grown depressed over his boring, uneventful life, which seems to have been ripped straight out of a J. Crew catalog.  To alleviate his misery, the Narrator begins attending self-help meetings, but not meetings for depressed people.  Instead, he goes to meetings for cancer survivors, drug addicts, abuse victims; by watching the misery of others, the Narrator starts to feel better about his own life.  It's perverse and macabre, but it's also handled with wicked brilliance, and this is where `Fight Club' really shines.Unfortunately, just when the film starts to get good, the Narrator meets two people: Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who also attends self-meetings under false pretenses; and the enigmatic Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic man who, like the Narrator, also feels the strain and depression of being forced to live a homogenized life.  Durden's solution to this problem is his Fight Club, which is a group of disillusioned men who strip their lives down to their primitive instincts by beating the crap out of each other and doing other random, anarchic things.As Durden, much credit should be heaped upon Brad Pitt who's simply awesome in the role; even if the raw concept of `Fight Club' sounds stupid, Pitt, as Durden, speaks about his Fight Club with such passionate conviction that it at least sounds appealing for a few seconds. Unfortunately, no one ever seems to question Durden after they've had time to mull over the concept, and the members of Fight Club remain loyal to a man even after they've gotten their first taste of beating each other to a pulp.  What was a clever movie becomes instead oddly fixated on pointless violence, and that's where `Fight Club' starts to lose steam - and some of Durden's later, bigger plans just bring the film to a grinding halt.Part of Fincher's message in `Fight Club' is to point out the frustrations of the characters and the absurdities of their desperate solutions. However, this message is never clear, and in many ways Fincher instead seems to be glorifying the message of violence instead of condemning it. Fincher's direction is almost too good - it glamorizes violence to the point of looking slick and cool, instead of raw and disturbing, as it needs to be. Fincher has phenomenal visual style, but it unfortunately seems to be exactly what `Fight Club' doesn't need.  There's a certain irony to `Fight Club' - the disenfranchised young men belonging to Durden's Fight Club are essentially trading one controlled society for another - but the irony is lost when it is painted with pure adrenaline.Without giving the ending of `Fight Club' away, I'll just say that it's ineptly handled, and it suffers from the same thing many recent films have been afflicted with: Keyser Soze Disease. There's a revelation at the end of `Fight Club' that's supposed to literally blow the audience away, and profoundly change the events of the entire film (as the revelation of the identity of Keyser Soze in `The Usual Suspects' did for that film). In `Fight Club's case, though, the supposedly shocking ending seems forced, and doesn't make all the prior events of the film seem all that much different. It's shock value for the pure sake of shock, not to enhance the rest of the movie. A number of films since `The Usual Suspects' have relied on this shock-ending gimmick . . . but unless there's a good script to fall back on, this gimmick usually backfires.  It definitely backfires in `Fight Club'.`Fight Club' has a few great moments, and it certainly has the look of a great film.  Unfortunately, it's not great. It's a slick, muddled film with a garbled message.  Honestly, rent Fincher's `The Game' instead of this film - it has a similar message, except it's much clearer . . . and much better. `Fight Club' is forgettable.

" Intense!
",,"When I first saw the movie trailer of Fight Club, I thought that this has some potential to be a good movie.  But... I didn't get to see this movie because of a hectic schedule that I set myself up for.  Exhausted, I stopped following my schedule a few months later.  I went out, got myself a membership to a local video store and decided to become an instant movie buff and got a whole bunch of newly released video tapes.  Out of all the movies I saw, Fight Club stood out and was the only movie that I repeated over and over.  I knew about the great actors, interesting idea and the violence of this movie, but I was shocked to find a thought-provoking and breathtaking film.  I have seen hundreds of movies before this and I was impressed to say the least.  This is the most relevant movie for me.  Like the main character, (played effortlessly by Edward Norton) I also was and still is suffering from insomnia and also from, what looks to be the same reasons as he was.  He was suffering and needed something in his life.  He meets Tyler Durden (seemingly played with great ease by Brad Pitt) in a plane trip and becomes his new best friend.  Together, they develop Fight Club (self-explanatory isn't it?).  I will not say more about this movie because I want people who haven't seen this to not know what to expect like I did when I watched this film.  The surprise does help give the film the feeling that it needs.  Not a film for everyone due to excessive violence, sex and gore ,but for anyone who can stand it all and hasn't seen it yet, watch it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Oops. Fincher did it again.
",,"People are always asking me if I know Tyler Durden.  It's not that we look alike, or anything-- it's just that the very idea behind the existence of Mr. Durden is one of angst, of loss, of mass confusion of what exactly Males are supposed to be as we enter the 21st century.  For thousands, or tens of thousands of years, we were hunters, fierce warriors who stalked and killed our prey to feed our families and tribes; we fought for and defended our families, our communities, our ways of life.  These days, we stay up late watching infomercials, and spend time abusing the copy machine at work. Ain't progress grand?Hollywood makes movies that appeal to the largest common denominator, and clearly this movie is not for everyone.  (Though in 40 years, it might be-- Hitchcock movies bombed in their own decades, too.  Figure that one out). But ideally, it appeals to those of us who are lost, those of us who didn't even know how bad things had gotten-- how good it can be for the soul to just punch someone in the face every now and then.HOWEVER-- that doesn't mean punching someone is right.  This User Comment, and this film, do not advocate violence.  But the idea behind it, we are told, is something worth just thinking about... so we may factor it into our lives, and our future, to know ourselves and form a conclusion based on the whole, not by denying Who We Are.  If you prefer your movies idea-free, then back off this one and go rent ""Navy SEALS.""  I hear Charlie Sheen is very good in that.Here, knock-you-OUT performances from Brad ""I'm so pretty they'll never give me an Oscar, but they SHOULD"" Pitt, and the just as perfectly cast Edward ""I transcend your foolish award system"" Norton.  Stimulated with conversation, this movie should hopefully affect you in positive ways, to at least make you think about what it's trying to say, whether you agree with it or not. Some parts are hilarious.  Some parts are difficult to watch.  I hope you can say the same about your own life.And then Kenneth Turan of the L.A. Times writes, ""... a witless mishmash of whiny, infantile philosophizing and bone-crunching violence that actually thinks it's saying something of significance.""  It is saying something significant, Kenneth, to everyone except you.  And with your cushy little high-paying job as a FILM CRITIC, I guess you don't have any reason to find fault with your life, do you?  Is that what a man looks like?We look forward to your return, Mr. Durden.10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

This concept is an intriguing and original one, and works really well. Then there is the script, it is absolutely superb, with dialogue that will make you both laugh and think. Fight Club is very well made, with elaborate production design, great editing and startling images. David Fincher's direction is brilliantly handled and the performances of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt are superb. Overall, just a great film, a mesmerising ride through the 1990s male psyche. 9/10 Bethany Cox",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Solid character study and a good performance from Norton
",spoiler,"""Fight Club"" is an Academy Award nominated (sound effects) movie from roughly 15 years ago starring Edward Norton (a two-time Academy award nominee at under 30), Brad Pitt, Meat Loaf and Helena Bonham Carter. It's possibly the most famous movie from director David Fincher, although it's far from his best in my opinion. That does not mean it's a bad film. not at all. However, many of the characters are simply way over the top that the film always is in danger of surpassing the fine line of entertainment and ridiculousness. It's based on a Palahniuk novel and the script comes from Jim Uhls, who had a surprisingly insignificant career after coming up with the words for this cult film.The dialogs are witty and almost too hip occasionally. It's not a film for easily offended people as it tends to be vulgar at times and the violence is graphic frequently, although that is certainly not a surprise for a film titled ""Fight Club"". In general, it's a pretty insane film, most of the time in a good way. the fact that two characters visit meetings of dying people, so they can feel better says it pretty much all already. I clearly preferred Norton over Putt here and it is self-explanatory that Pitt did not get a single awards nomination for his work here. He becomes pretty much a caricature at times. Then again, his character does not really exist, so this can be used as some kind of apology I guess. The final plot twist comes unexpected and reminded me of the one in ""The Usual Suspects"", only that the main character is still unaware of his true identity. By the way, Norton looked pretty much the same age in this film as now 15 years later, where he scored another Academy Award nomination for his work in a Best Picture winner.The ending was pretty great though and I liked how, with the disappearance of Pitt after the gunshot, we finally see also the darker side of Norton's character when he and Bonham Carter's character watch the explosions. But how did that gunshot do so little damage? Did the pain make Pitt's character go away? Anyway, ""Fight Club"" is a good movie. Not one of my personal favorites, but an entertaining 140 minutes, during which it almost never drags. One of my favorite scenes was near the end at the police station when he gets interrogated and almost emasculated. That was pretty funny there.

" Another Emperor's New Clothes
",,"It's amazing that anyone thought this was watch-able, never mind brilliant. The acting, camera work and music are all good, but the story is so absurd, it had me laughing out loud. I can understand that a fight club could come to be, but this story has it wrapped up in anti-consumerism  and other heady subjects. It just doesn't fly. Show me one backyard boxing enthusiast with these intellectual ideals. They're in it for the fighting. At least show me how the first fight club member was inducted. Two guys start it and the next thing you know there are a hundred members willing to die for their leader. When did that and happen and how? These are huge unanswered questions and without the answers it makes the whole thing seem so implausible that I could not suspend my disbelief.The thing about the body organs was shoe-horned in to give some novel-like cohesiveness, but when they transferred it using statements like, ""This is Jack's complete lack of surprise,"" it became a ridiculous sophomoric device. The attempts at humor were embarrassing. It's good to add some humor to lighten the tension, but here the gags seemed to be dropped in from a Farrelly Brothers movie and were so out-of-place that it seemed that the movie had an identity crisis. Also, the gags were childish and weren't funny. Helena Bonham Carter's character was not only completely unbelievable, but also superfluous. The character could be removed and the overall story would not change one bit. So, why is this character here? I found all the characters to be unbelievable and absurd. Their motivations and dialog made little or no sense at all. Sometimes the dialog and narration seemed to be selected just to make a character say something provocative, even if it made no sense. The scenes where Ed Norton was beating himself up was like watching a MST3K episode, only I was filling in the commentary. And near the end we get a bizarre twist that's really just a cheap trick by the filmmaker. I felt cheated because I was led down a path without enough information to put together the reality. In ""The Sixth Sense"" or ""A Beautiful Mind"", they left the door open, so at the end you realize all the info was there. In ""Fight Club"" you are summarily duped. Overall, this film seems like the work of an edgy high school student  all style, no substance and a bunch of quirky, edgy characters that couldn't possibly exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I started watching it two hours after I woke up after a 9 hour sleep!Face it, this movie gets really boring at times. Pitt is often mumbling useless phrases, dull story (after the two get together) and there is an illogical ending.But for me the most disturbing is the whole idea of changing your life, becoming sensitive again(what??) by engaging into bloody, futile fights. Who would do that? You wanna fight, go to Darfur and fight for the starved women and children getting raped and killed every day. Trust me, you'll make your life interesting, you'll escape this ''stinking'' consumer society and on your way might just save someone's life or raise a few eyebrows. I am not from USA and not really aware of this ''horrible'' life of the American white collar worker, but if this movie has ''opened your eyes'' then my friends you really are in it deep.On the good side the movie is very stylish and the acting is first class. 7.5/10 just for these attributes.

" One of the Top 10 Movies Ever Made!!!
",,"Over the past few years, Fight Club has become my favorite movie. When I begin thinking about what actually attracts me to the thriller so much, the first things that come into my mind is uniqueness and completeness.Few movies have successfully captured such a twisted plot and produced an enjoyable, edge of the seat movie like Fight Club. From the beginning, the camera shots and ideas really get your adrenaline pumping. Combine the unbelievable graphics and stunt-effects with a boring turned exciting story and you have the makings for one hell of a ride.Fight Club truly has the entire package. Many good movies are close to being complete, but typically lack one or two key aspects for entertainment. Fight Club has the actors (Brad Pitt and Ed Norton's best acting jobs), the plot (unique and relative), and one of the best endings in movie history.You must ride this baby out because if you miss anything, you may be sorry.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A film desperately trying to justify itself without succeeding
",,"As you watch the film from the beginning, there is a chance for a deep film that goes inside the mind of the narrator (Edward Norton) and his counter-part Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), and mostly the film succeeds for showing the slow transformation of the narrator into Tyler through the creation of an underground fight club. The premise works, however, there are too many times where the movie switches from the surreal to the utmost impossible. Though the film builds up in the first 2/3 the last is disappointing with just an idiotic ending plot along with an incoherent story. Though the narrator goes into a mode of ""self-discovery"" and the idea of man vs. himself in the end, which works, it isn't enough to save the film from keeling over from the abomination known as the human thirst for quick sell-outs for which the book version tries to state to all.

" Over Rated
",,"Fight Club, by David Fincher, is the story of a man who comes to grip with the daily monotony that is his everyday life, by starting a club in which friends beat each other senselessly in hopes of having a good time.  This movie had all the right ingredients to be a great film.  With the help of superlative performances and brilliant photography, Fight Club is quite a picture.  However, the dark aspects of the film and preposterous climax make it hard for one to watch without cringing or laughing in the wrong spots. Fight Club takes many turns that are completely nonsensical in hopes of making a political statement about United States economic culture. Nevertheless it is hard for one to listen to statements such as these without questioning where the money came from to make such a film.  Fight Club is defiantly an inventive film but in the end like the Portland Trailblazers, it just doesn't `click.'",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" ""Clockwork Orange"" this ain't...
",,"Is ""Fight Club"" an endorsement of faschism and violence, or merely a cautionary tale? None of the above. David Fincher's controversial fourth feature is simply put, one big joke, that the unsuspecting audience is subjected to, under the pretense of criticizing modern consumerism and materialism, as well as mourning the loss of true masculinity by today's y-chromosome bearers. Edward Norton, a renegade corporate slave, and Brad Pitt, a flamboyant, mysterious rebel, organize a cult-like establishment where men can turn to for venting of their innate aggression. Before long, the aggression is redirected toward the rest of the world.  The film spews much venom aimed, it seems, at human life in general, occasionally hitting the right spots, provoking the viewer to sport a wicked grin or two, but no more. Fincher's penchant for nihilism does not leave room for any other feelings when viewing these frequently pointless displays of brutality. In the end, especially in the light of the twisted, ""Sixth Sense""-inspired parallel ending which only strengthens the ""joke effect"", one gets the impression that the movie is trying to meddle in too many genres at once, while not being powerful or engaging enough to stand outside genre boundaries.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Yes, I did get the point of the movie.  And yes, I do appreciate the talents of Edward Norton and Brad Pitt.  But no, I did not like this movie.  Fight Club is the manifesto for all those frustrated middle class white males out there; a permission slip for them to be mad at the world.  The unabashed testosterone-fest will appeal to most males; anyone with a shred of intelligence will see right through it.  The issue is complicated, however, by excellent execution and a good first act.(Spoilers follow)Edward Norton plays your average joe who has everything--apartment, job, furniture.  Everything, that is, but a life.  This all changes for him when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) and is told: ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can.""  They start up a little fight club, a great little counter-culture type of thing where everyone like them can get their aggression at society out.  Bully for them.This is where the movie goes right off the tracks into left field.  The movie is complicated by Project Mayhem, an offshoot of the fight club where members are asked to be part of some sort of cult.  But wait a minute. Wasn't the point of Fight Club to break away and become an individual? Why are these ""liberated"" men making themselves prisoners?  And does it make any sense to fight against society's propaganda by creating your own propaganda and creating an alternative society?Not really.  But this movie doesn't care, and it doesn't expect us to ask these types of questions.  It expects us to sit back, eat up the movie's philosophy and listen to Tyler Durden's endless preaching (only about half of which makes any sense or fit into any cohesive whole).  Elements of a psychological thriller, a twist ending, and a minor romance just complicate matters--none of the parts add up to much.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Mischief. Mayhem. Masterpiece.
",,"Being definitely the best movie of 1999, it is impossible to discover the reason of why this movie received so few awards. When I look at the awards page of ""Fight Club"", what do I see? That the movie won OFCS awards for best DVD and best DVD awards. Well, I thought that opinions are not to be discussed, but I got to say this one: SHAME ON YOU!!! This movie is one of the best in movie history, I have no doubt, and I can start figuring a why to explain its overlooking by the academy awards and others: it is a violent slap in the face of all the people who think they are safe in their monochordic lives, their credit cards, their stable jobs and their month paychecks, which are used for owning things ""which end up owning ourselves"". The philosophy of the movie is brutal, and never before seen in a movie made in USA grounds. Edward Norton and Brad Pitt turn out establishing themselves as two of the best actors to ever grace the silver screen, and David Fincher leaves us drooling for his next feature. This movie will stagger even the most coldly hearted, as it depicts the life of a character whose name we don't know (not until the end, that is), who we know just by the name of ""Jack"", and who lives a more than normal live: shirts, kakis, ties, a desk job, a nice paycheck and his nights spent decorating his house and seeing the tv-shopping. Jack has a problem: he can't sleep. He will find the cure for this problem, but he will also find lots of other things. I can guarantee it, you have never seen anything like this movie, and never miss out the first 30 minutes, which have a frenetic rhythm to go with Jack's first-person point of view of his life before his problems. I thought that ""Se7en"" was one of my favorite movies. It still is, but it isn't alone. The fact that both movies come from the same director, it means a lot - it means that David Fincher is a powerhouse director who has a lot to give, and from who we may expect great and landmark-ish things from the future. I take my hats off to the whole team: Pitt and Norton are stand-outs, the script is the whole asset of the movie (Chuck Palahniuk's novel (from which the movie is inspired) is a smacking good piece of literature), the Dust Brothers' electronic score is a record to own, Helena Bonham Carter's Marla is as perfect as she could possibly be, the photography, the sound and the editing just make your jaw drop. Never miss out this one, and if you have a DVD player, enjoy even more the experience in a finely-crafted package - at least it won awards for that! One of those movies I would have given an 11. No less.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" sucks worse than a blackhole
",,"i have read many reviews for this movie and most of them used words like unique, excellent and life changing. i have just one question how? the acting by both the leads was good, i got to admit that, but haven't people heard of something called a script. the movie was just a collection of pathetic scenes each one leaving you more confused and bored then u were before. well for direction, there wasn't any. all in all i have to say i have seen my share of bad movie, this one is a strong contender for the top spot. its a shame talent like brad Pitt considered doing such a mindless, senseless, scriptless and tasteless movie, which even the brilliant acting by the male leads couldn't save. the one point is purely for the acting.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Fincher's tour de force is a bruising assault on the senses
",spoiler,"David Fincher's dark, brooding assault on the senses employs much of the same style as he used in SEVEN, to great effect. This is a complex, intelligent film which, for a change, doesn't take the viewer for granted. A big streak of black comedy runs through the centre, making things a bit easier to cope with, but it's still a morose, disturbing film, a good film, yes, but not one which makes you feel good after watching it.The plot twists and turns continually, from beginning to end. Things start off on a relatively small scale to become outrageous and explosive at the film's finale. There's also one of those very-clever twists at the end, so favoured by the likes of THE USUAL SUSPECTS. There is plenty of sick humour, the highlight being the hilarious scene involving the liposuction fat - you'll know it when you see it.With a film like this, the acting has to be brilliant, and it frequently is. Edward Norton excels as the narrator of the story, caught up in all the madness, and it's a multi-faceted, psychologically-focused performance. Brad Pitt doesn't really stretch himself but he fits the bill well and isn't afraid to put off his female fans by appearing broken and bloodied in a film like this. Other actors, ranging from Meat Loaf to Jared Leto, are also very good.The violence is extremely brutal and unglamourised. Heads are knocked hard against concrete, acid is poured over flesh, teeth are knocked out, and noses are split open. This is a hard film to watch, but fascinating at the same time. Fiendishly clever and highly suspenseful, I would rate FIGHT CLUB as one of the best films of 1999 - on par with THE SIXTH SENSE, and just under my favourite, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT. Buy it, rent it, steal it, but be prepared: you won't be the same afterwards.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Overrated crap
",,"Fight club represents all that's worst in the 90's, coincidentally also stars Brad Pitt in it, something that amuses me i must confess.Few other movies are as hyped in IMDb as this one, this movie created an enormous legions of fans all with their little own understanding of what the movie represents, every single Fight Club fan has it's own idea what the movie is about.As for the movie itself it's fairly decent and the acting is good. Unfortunately i can't stand Pitt, both his acting and his face ,so the whole process of watching it was unbearable.I won't dwell on what the story is because no fight club fan would agree with me, like i said beforehand, everyone has a different thought on what it represents.The story doesn't really entertained me, i feel this movie has a very specific audience in mind, like people who work in same office for 30 years and lost their balls, and viewing this they can dream a bit.Anyway i despise pretty much all Pitt movies, i hate this one even more because of their fan base. But worth seeing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Well acted and well shot, but I don't get the fuss...
",,"This is one of those movies that anyone I speak to loves. It is this fact that urged me to actually give it a try a couple of years ago and I got halfway through (roughly) and gave up. Last week though I gave it a second shot, and watched it in it's entirety this time around. What I saw wasn't bad but I found myself curious why this movie gets so much praise.The performances were good, although I think Ed Norton was somewhat incoherent at times of narration. I have no problem with the acting shown here, and I also think as a piece of cinema it is well shot, with good direction. This isn't an entirely negative review.I must, however, stop the praise here. I think this movie gets more praise than it deserves, and honestly I think it may be in-part down to the cast. Ed Norton was endearing himself to a lot of people at this time and Brad Pitt has always been a massive name, and is an excellent actor.Where this movie falls down for me is, it doesn't seem to go anywhere. The story is shown in such a way that I felt like it was merely an excuse to show violence at times. Sure, anyone watching a movie called Fight Club surely can't be shocked at some violence, but I saw it as essential to the driving of the movie rather than the additional section I feel it was meant to be.I also didn't feel like the movie went anywhere in particular. I know it has a plot and it comes to a conclusion, but it never felt like I cared about the ending, a 'twist' that was pretty obvious from early on in the movie, at least for me.I'm not completely slating this movie, as stated above, it has it's merits. Just not one for me, and I hope i'm not completely alone in thinking this way.5 out of 10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Fight Club Review
",,"Fight club is definitely yet to be challenged in the genre of cult films, of all the cult films i have seen clockwork orange has come the closest but still lacks a touch of brilliance that fight club brings to the table.Firstly i want to talk about the performance of brad pitt, it has to be the best of his acting career. The character of tyler durden is completely mastered, the film's interpretation of the books tyler, was very accurate, a person who believes that working for what society deems to be normal, sitting in a office typing your life away to buy things we don't even need, is hit head on from the performance of brad pitt.David finchers view of the world according to fight club is frighteningly realistic, in parts of the film the philosophical theme can leave you thinking whether working for the rest of your life is actually the answer, Finchers unusual concept of directing was perfect for fight club, in my opinion if anybody else had tried to interpret chuck palahniuk's novel, it would have crashed to the ground faster than the release hot shots part deux.The quotations used in the film are scripted to perfection, delivery of the quotes are also perfect. Also i have to complement fincher again on his choice of actor/actresses, Norton plays the part of a sleepless insomniac dead on and helena bohnan carters role as the girlfriend dragged into the crazy world of the narrators character is nailed, The way the philosophies are brought into the films are also quite controversial, (I would tell you specific examples but i cannot include any spoiler), controversy is the core of any remotely successful cult film, which makes fight club the most crucial ingredient to the genre.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

It depicts a guy who hates his job, considers it slavery, who gets fed up with consumerism and capitalism, and starts destroying private property with his secret syndicate of anarchist-socialist buddies.Of course, it's no surprise avowed liberals like Brad Pitt and Edward Norton would take on the roles for this film.

" The best movie ever made
",,"In my view, David Fincher's loyal adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's book 'Fight Club' is the best movie ever made. I'll keep this piece short as I do not want to spoil any of the brilliant moments in the film, but the direction, acting, cinematography, soundtrack and in particular the script are incredible, hilarious and horrifically insightful into modern day male aggression in our society. A stereotypical 'blokes movie' is in actual fact a stupendously brilliant piece of cinema, and although its appeal will avoid the more squeamish of viewers, this hard hitting film as far as I'm concerned should be shown to everyone who has the slightest interest in films, male or female, as an example of how Hollywood can be successful not only as a money making machine, but as clever and insightful tool that entertains as it does dazzle. Oh and the twist ending...Incredible.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

After watching this movie, I had to read the book it was based on written by Chuck Palanhiuk. The book was far more interesting than the movie.

" Fincher's masterpiece
",,"I really like the work of David Fincher. I think Seven is one of the most beautifully crafted psychological thrillers in movie history. However i think Fight Club qualifies to be put in a whole different league than traditional movies. A movie like Fight Club, that manages to find and maintain it's coherence while dealing with profound subjects like existentialism and nihilism with dark humor and pretty violent action scenes (some fight scenes are very violent and bloody), is really hard to find. In fact for this reason is that i think that it should be qualified in a whole new perspective, because there are very few movies it could be compared to. The movie is about a guy who is really bored with his yuppie bureaucratic lifestyle but finds relieve when he meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who teaches him valuable life lessons. The fun of the movie is that this lessons are little by little unraveled while them (and later in the movie, their followers too) engage in brutal fist fights as a way of dealing with their issues with modern society. This fist fights then start becoming other activities increasingly more self-destructive. The beauty of the movie is that everything is extremely well done, from the cinematography (dark scenarios, surreal and practically dream-like sequences) to the soundtrack (great choice of music that enhance the dark feel of the movie) and the script (the dialog is great, conversations between the characters feel real and energetic: such a great dialog is hard to find in modern movies). And let's not forget about the performances, Ed Norton gives a great performance about a man whose boredom in life is so powerful that the only way he feels alive is by engaging in brutal fights with other desperate males. Brad Pitt gives what i think is the best performance of his career, playing the energetic but increasingly self-destructive and anarchistic Tyler Durden- Great Performances, Great Movie",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Where's my Furni catalogue?
",,"It amuses me when some person goes on a talk show and tells people not to see a film! The reaction to ""Fight Club"" and others by certain mouthy types (who might have even seen it!) was really a dumb approach to avoiding attention directed at what they perceive as dangerous. Michael Medved was a bit less silly in his various objections over the years than others (Kathie Lee Gifford for instance), as a critic having watched Oliver Stone's ""JFK"", which he called ""an evil film"" and ""Natural Born Killers"" (he described it as a lot of things, among them, ""never boring"", in his pan review).So here we are, ten years after this David Fincher directed adaptation of Chuck Palahniuk's novel (Jim Uhls wrote the screenplay). Blu-ray is the new standard for watching discs at home and ""FC"" has just come out in this format (with an adorably annoying ""Never Been Kissed"" initial menu pop up showing everyone's favourite friend of Edward Norton, Drew Barrymore!). I'll buy it eventually. For now, the old two disc special edition will hold up just fine with it's four commentary tracks (including one with Palahniuk and Uhls). The world is much more screwed up than a decade ago and almost all of that is definitely not the fault of ""FC"" or any other work which doesn't pretend joining hands and singing ""Kumbaya"" will make our species love itself and end our crises.""FC"" is like a street and book wise reaction to infomercials that promise some help for the unhappy and broken in society. Any mature adult has reached the conclusion that the bad things in life make up at least half of what even the best adjusted of us must cope with. ""Jack"", the ultimate unreliable narrator, is burnt out. His life degenerates into travelling as a paid stooge for a big company, weighing whether paying people for what money can't make up in losses works for his bosses. He doesn't just hit rock bottom, he orders Furni (read, IKEA!) products from there! How much can a person have left of their soul when they are drawn to 12 step meetings for conditions nobody in their right mind wants to cope with?So when the tag team from new friend hell emerge, ""Marla"" and ""Tyler"", ""Jack"" is drawn to both of their live for today spirits. He's such a function of the clock, going out into the world without a watch and an itinerary is his ultimate rebellion. The question is, how long can the narrator keep up with the dastardly duo who shock and invigorate him?There's a wonderful collection of essays on the film, some long and complex, others short and to the point. Not many movies can warrant a book about what started as a book. ""Fight Club"" remains as a phoenix rising out of show biz's late 90s ashes. Will offend as many, if not more, than it delights.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Relation of Tyler and the narrator the world and to man
",spoiler,"Fight Club is a movie that claims that the norms and goals of Americans are not meaningful; a nihilist's life of revolution does have significance, and that everyone has some Tyler Durden in them. The narrator and main character that goes nameless throughout the movie in a way represents all of mankind. He has the typical job, is obsessed with the material and is nothing more than a thing to the world. The Narrator is someone not fulfilled with life; making is way in and out of AA and other support groups in order to maintain himself emotionally. His counterpart and associate is Tyler Durden. Tyler represents something that is greater than man, an unreal ideality that lives on behalf and threw the Narrator. Tyler is a character that inspires man to be more than just man. There is a relation between Tyler Durden and man, and the role of Tyler in the world.What Tyler Durden has is ability and power. For example, there are many fights throughout Fight Club and the fight that Tyler Loses, he actually wins. Tyler Durden stands on a plane with Jesus and Nietzsche's Overman, a crossbred between God and man. What is inspirational about Tyler is that he and the narrator are the same person. The narrator, who is a man, crosses a barrier and becomes something greater than man. Tyler is not human; he is more an idea, and a symbol of revolution. The Narrator's relation to Tyler is a role of assistance. Tyler inspires the Narrator, gives him a place to live, mentors him and together they start a revolution. The two characters are more productive together than they are separately, though they are dependent on the other. The Narrator suffers from insomnia and later the audience realizes that he suffers from a split personality disorder. Through his mental disabilities the narrator turns himself into Tyler. The narrator is able to break away from the boredom of everyday life by being Tyler Durden. The idea of a club where people fight without protection and at their own discretion, where the first two rules standout as fight club being a club of secrecy, becomes a form of therapy for men, then a way of life for society. The narrator realizes the unnecessary of materials, and then realizes that work, water and other basic needs are not needed. The narrator frees himself from the security that food, shelter and water provide. Where at one time he was consumed by the material, trying to fill his apartment with the perfect Liz Clayborn piece that would capture the perfect mood for his kitchen, the narrator realizes the meaninglessness of projects that only seem to serve a purpose of life. The blessing for the narrator comes when his apartment gets blown up and everything in it destroyed. The narrator falls to apathy, but from his apathy comes freedom. He doesn't care if his teeth fall out or if he has to wear the same clothes to work every day. His actions toward a fight club have purpose and meaning, because what the fight club eventually does is starts a revolution. Toward the end of the movie the audience as well as the narrator discovers that the narrator is Tyler Durden. Through this realization the narrator becomes aware that Tyler, though his mentor was destructive, and had to be gotten rid of. In the end who ends up prevailing? Though the narrator ends up living, he causes himself to shoot himself, in order for Tyler to perish. Furthermore, Tyler's legacy lives on, Tyler never physically existed, and if he was never physically he can be disposed of physically. The narrator attempts to get rid of Tyler in an ideal way, by physically attacking himself. Though he does disappear, again, he never existed. At the end of the film, the credit card companies are destroyed and the beginning of the end comes to a close as the chaos prepares to unfold on the earth. These actions, these doings, are because of Tyler Durden. The idea of him lives out physically through the destruction of earth. The effects of Tyler become more real than Tyler. At the same time the narrator overcomes the superman, Tyler. Showing that it is capable for man to not only surpass mankind, but at the same time to overcome himself. In conclusion, Fight Club deals with the desire of man's quest for power to be fulfilled to the point where revolution can be achieved. That man is not limited to living a repeated, boring life of meaninglessness. Tyler Durden Stands as one of the best characters to ever be on cinema. Tyler was able to achieve greatness with ease, leaving the question of why he even waited as long as he did to change the world.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The first rule is: you can't praise it enough.
",,"I can't say much more about this film that hasn't been already said. But I would really like to give it a try.I've heard about this movie since it was released, but still wasn't that interested yet. Thankfully I have one friend who'd already watch it and literally made watch too. The result was obvious (This film causes these reactions). I felt it was too short, it kept wanting more and more. The way the story is told is unique. But that is not all. The script, the acting, the photography, etc.(I can go on and on). This film is definitely a masterpiece.The teasers show only small portions of this film, making it seem like a mindless fighting movie. This is not the case. The story is about a furniture obsessed guy, who had insomnia. He decided to form a club in which he could unleash all of his energy and finally be able to caught some sleep. But after a while, things went out of control, and nothing was what it seemed.People often tell me that I am too picky when it comes to movies. That pretty much nothing impresses me, that I don't like popular films etc. But after watching this kind of film it is difficult to be impressed by the average film.This movie set a new personal mark in this genre. Like The Good, The Bad & The Ugly did it in its genre for example.To sum up, I became a David Fincher fan since I really like films like Se7en or The Game and of course Fight Club. This is a must see for everyone who claims they know about films.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Drivers of Fascism

Everywhere someone - some twisted mind - is out there to take control of emotionally vulnerable people and then channelize it to their own end.

Take the Al-Qaeda, Lashkar or Hitler, Stalin all seem to have a basic lack of respect for human life and they all are like Tyler ... the only difference being Tyler (I mean Norton) tries to redeem himself in the end. Sure as hell we know rest of the Hitlers and his ilk never knew what they were doing ...And why just fascists ... even religious preachers, communists or just about anybody who is fanatic enough to convert others to his point of view with a crusaders zeal (to the point of trying to eliminate people if they do not convert) all come under the scanner in this brilliant movie.On a different note, for a long time I was under the impression that this movie is one of ""Fast and furious"" varieties ... am happy that ultimately I overcame my inhibition to see this masterpiece.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I was wrong.The line in my title grabbed me because I have always thought about ""stuff"" and how it ties you down. People can't get divorced when the love is gone because of ""stuff."" People can't move to a better location because of ""stuff."" ""Stuff"" is choking us all.It is like the Kipling poem: If you can make one heap of all your winnings And risk it all on one turn of pitch-and-toss, And lose, and start again at your beginnings And never breath a word about your loss;then you will be a man!Besides, ""stuff."" we are chocked by consumerism; which may be the same thing. The film is replete with phallic symbols and decries the femininization of men.""We're a generation of men raised by women. I'm wondering if another woman is really the answer we need.""Fight Club gives us an emphatic NO to that question. But, then, what is Marla's role? To show us that we are lying to ourselves? Hmmm.This film had brilliant performances by Edward Norton, Brad Pitt, and Helena Bonham Carter, under the superb direction of David Fincher.

" Good but overrated.
",,"I liked this movie but it wasn't life changing and thought provoking. I liked the twist at the end but not even that could, in my mind, catapult it to the status it has. The movie is enjoyable, I just think that it isn't one of the best movies in history. For me to consider a movie to be truly great it has to stir up emotions, not just make you think. A movie to be considered great has to touch the viewer on an emotional level and have the people still thinking about the movie even after the movie is over and this movie doesn't do that. I do recommend that you see it but I certainly don't consider it a great movie and it certainly isn't in my top 20 movies.

" Great Movie
",,"This is a brilliant movie, it really goes deep inside the decay of society as Tyler Durden or the people of the U.S. sees it. Every word he says in his speech about we as middle age men or young adults, have no great war or no great depression, all of it is true, every word. We as people living in America right now, we have nothing to look forward to, maybe somebody's birth day or Christmas, but what do we really have. The government has us so tightly bound it is ridiculous, trying to control everything from wearing seat-belts and the video games we play to the control of other governments in other countries. This movie is almost a way to run your life with the whole ""its only after we've lost everything that we are free to do anything."" That is my opinion on this Great movie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" best movies ever made
",,"This has to be one of the best movies ever made! Fight Club tells the tale of an insomniac who is losing his grip on reality. Then, he meets Tyler, and that is when all hell breaks out! The narration given by Edward Norton is powerful and haunting, and it makes the suspense and terror seem that more realistic. This is the kind of movie where you cannot tell the story to others too much without giving the whole movie away. The ending is one of the best I have ever seen in a movie since Usual Suspects. This is a powerful movie which will make you believe that chaos can end all existence. I think EVERYONE should see this movie. It is gruesome and violent at times, but it's worth it! It's a shame that I can only give it 5 stars. It really should be 100 stars, or even more! Fight Club is without a doubt one of the best movies ever made!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Amazing! One of the best films ever made!
",,"This film is incredible. I watched it not quite knowing what to expect and from the very start i was utterly transfixed and never wanted it to end.It was so well directed and visually it is incredible. I found myself thinking ""wow, that was a brilliant shot"" every five seconds. It was also superbly acted with Brad Pitt, Edward Norton and Helen Bonham- Carter giving performances of a lifetime. Pitt especially manages to make his character Tyler Durden possibly the coolest character ever to grace the silver screen. Norton also manages to make his character superbly awkward and intense. This film is not only amazingly made but it is also a thrilling story and contains probably the best plot ever in the history of film as it seems to contain everything. Incredible Film!!!!

" ""I want you to hit me as hard as you can.""
",,"Fight Club is the Man's Manual to Manhood. My friend Josh told me that once, and I have got to say, I agree with him 100%. Fight Club is one of the most entertaining, exciting, and explosive movies ever to hit the big screen. It's a love story entangled in the ideas of Anarchy and explosive. It all begins with a man called Jack who is depressed and begins going to support groups and meets a girl named Marla. His insomnia starts all over again. Then he meets Tyler Durden, a man of mystery and unusual substance. Tyler sells soap. Together they create Fight Club which is an underground boxing society, their idea catches on and spreads quickly and evolves into Project Mayhem. Jack eventually stops Tyler who turns out to be his alter ego. The end. An awesome film with great acting and performances from Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and even Jared Leto makes an appearance in the movie as Angel Face. The movie gives a self-destructive point of view on life and love, and explores the possibilities of anarchy.This is definitely one no one should miss.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Waking up just got to hurt!
",,"Palahniuk talks about the modern man who enslaves himself for all the wrong reasons. The story is a criticism on the consumer-driven world we are living in, about the ties in our lives which are mostly material, society, and about our dreams to one day say and do what we mean and want - it's about freedom and a way to achieve it, or at least rebel against the status quo. The movie is an introspection, and a close and cynical observation of the exterior world, where we stand in it, It's a glimpse into the reality of things. It's smart, and an eye opener.The movie itself is perhaps Fincher's best, dark, stylish and brutal. It made me want to punch certain aspects of my life in the face and in many ways changed the way I react to things. And by the way, has anyone else seen the multiple subliminal frames in which Tyler appears before he actually appears? - have you never almost seen him in your everyday life?

" Ladies and gentlemen,welcome to Fight Club...
",,"There is a huge misconception regarding this movie: a superficial plot summary will dismiss it as a hyper-violent thriller with fascist undertones (in fact, Roger Ebert called it ""the most frankly and cheerfully fascist big-star movie since Death Wish""). Some even refer to it as a '90s version of Kubrick's masterpiece A Clockwork Orange, with added blood. Such descriptions are very reductive and misleading.It may be very violent at times (the most gruesome bits make Scorsese's movies look rather tame), that's undeniable, but Fight Club is much more than that. Its complex, non-linear and fascinating script (based on the eponymous cult novel) deals with revolution, madness, and yes, fascism on a certain level, and the film's greatness lies in how David Fincher, who had already shown his edgy talent on Se7en and is at the top of his game here, combines those themes to comment on our society. That's right, beneath the gore and anarchic atmosphere lies a carefully constructed, though not very subtle, satire on consumerism (as Brad Pitt's character puts it: ""Advertising has us chasing sports cars and clothes, working jobs we hate, so we can buy sh*t we don't need"").The film stars Edward Norton as a nameless, bored, insomniac office geek who's trying to find a meaning for his life. In order to do this he starts attending various support groups, even though he has none of the diseases (testicular cancer among them) dealt with in those groups.This is when he meets Marla Singer (an almost unrecognizable Helena Bonham Carter), a woman who fakes as much as he does, and accuses her of messing up his life. The real mess, however, starts when the Narrator runs into Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt): this guy claims to be a simple soap producer and salesman, but in reality he's a rebel, a psychopath who thinks people truly know themselves only after they have been in a fight. Together, the two create Fight Club, an illegal association where frustrated men in their thirties can unleash all their suppressed rage, as long as they follow some simple rules (as a matter of fact, writing this review constitutes a violation of the first two). But as everyone knows, violence creates more violence, and soon enough what started as an unusual way to deal with boredom becomes an increasingly dangerous game of manipulation and destruction.Said manipulation suits Fincher well, the dark, bizarrely funny universe he has created serving as a tool to reflect not only on the changing society, but also on film itself as an art-form. While the characters break the rules on screen, the director breaks them on his own work, frequently exposing the fictional nature of what is being shown (the characters address the audience directly, a pornographic frame Tyler inserts in a family movie pops up in the actual film). In the middle of this controlled chaos, Fincher can rely on a marvelous cast: Norton is mesmerizing, seamlessly moving from total apathy to fearful awareness; Bonham Carter still has to find a role as demanding, compelling and rewarding as Marla; as for Brad Pitt, he shamelessly steals the show from start to finish, perfecting the edge he had started to develop in Se7en and giving us his best performance ever. Incendiary and effortlessly cool, his only real turn as a villain is a mix of style, darkness and charisma that has been missing in every character he has played since..An absolute masterpiece, albeit one that demands at least a second viewing before it can be completely understood and embraced, Fight Club is one of the greatest movies of the '90s, perhaps even THE best of the entire decade.Totally unmissable",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A fantastic political statement, not to mention a genius of a film
",,"This is truly superb, one of the best films I have ever seen. This film has a very funny sense of humour, gritty fight scenes, clever concepts, a very clear political agenda and most importantly, one of the best endings of all time.David Fincher has seriously come on leaps and bounds since the disappointing Alien 3. As with Seven, his directing is spot on. It's dark and murky just like an underworld fight culture would be. At the same time, very good special effects are integrated within the film. The plot moves forward tremendously and sets the viewer up nicely for the ending. There is a fair amount of shock imagery in the film such as Norton's fight against Jared Leto. I don't mind violence in films but that particular scene is so relentless that it is hard to watch.Acting from everyone in this movie is superb. Norton gives his best performance after American History X. His delivery of dialogue is laden with sarcasm and is a joy to watch. The many character transformations he goes through is entirely believable. Pitt is also on top form, definitely better suited to playing edgier roles such as this and Twelve Monkeys to Meet Joe Black et al. Helena Bonham Carter is very sexy in this role, whilst at the same time, utterly repulsive. A very strong lead certainly does this film many favours. Meat Loaf is also a great character in the film who has a great rapport with Norton's character.A surprisingly psychological film, I would like to know what Freud would have thought of this film. This film actually got mentioned in one of my University lectures so it obviously has impressed the academic world somewhat. What is really fascinating is Tyler's anarchic solutions and how his ideology, whilst floored, does have its intentions. His Marxist beliefs are much more pure than those of Lenin in the Communist Russia era as Tyler even intends for himself to be insignificant within Project Mayhem. The relationship between Pitt and Norton is great to watch as it leads to great character development and adds to the humour of the film.Anyone in to suspense, black comedy, psychological thrillers or action will love this film. It is definitely one of the best films of the decade and has a massive following that will love it forever. Brad Pitt has never been so good and his performance as Tyler Durden is now legendary. Fight Club has clever concepts to spare and oozes style, offering much more than entertainment.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Dark, Twisted, Brilliant!
",spoiler,"***POSSIBLE SPOILERS*** ""Fight Club"" is quite simply the paramount masculine, intelligent thriller that succeeds in heavy suspense, engaging perplexity, and stylish, unconventional sequencing, all in dark, murky, and really hideous territory. Here is a film with a theme unashamed to embrace individuality, defiance, and conquest, which actually entertains destruction, mayhem, and madness, and works brilliantly as a study of the extreme effects of insomnia and isolation upon individuals who seek to combat their demons in coming together in an underground battle of hard-knocking, body-blowing punches to relinquish their frustrations on each other. Sounds sordid and demented enough? This doesn't even scratch the surface of this maniacal genius of an unconventional thriller which is as dark and murky as it is insane and prolific. We are never really introduced to narrator and key player Edward Norton's identity, only that he is constantly comparing himself to a figure named ""Jack"", perhaps an allusion to the common, labored, frustrated man straining to survive the chaos of American society. Along his quest of ""self-discovery"" (as one might put it), he is acquainted with Tyler Durden, a knowledgeable, quick-witted soap salesman practically representing the collectedness, confidence, and admiration Edward Norton so desperately desires in his seemingly pathetic existence (as his ""alter-ego""), who proposes that he and Norton form a society of fellow frustrated men seeking to relinquish their demons in an underground ""Fight Club"" (which later becomes the basis for an international group plotting destruction and mayhem). Another notable shadowy and rather belligerent character (and the only female character in the entire film) is Darla, a confused, seemingly ill broad with a grudge against the world and serious suicidal tendencies, who comes in play as the ""love desire aid"" to Pitt and Norton frequently, and perplexingly, throughout the film. This is a film whose primary purpose is to perhaps address the effects of frustration, aggravation, and disillusion with the world, and the extent of the extreme, as is characterized by man from society. Norton and Pitt team together to make soap, hang out, run an underground ""Fight Club"", create domestic terrorist cells, and eventually become mortal nemeses within themselves. What a thought-provoking, brutally honest, and maniacally subtle masterpiece of film-making this ""Fight Club"" experience is: it's entertaining, suspenseful, inquisitive, and mind-blowingly ingenious, and it's one of the most economic and effective thrillers you'll ever have the privilege to experience. **** out of ****",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Life imitates art...
",,"It's ironic that a film that is a warning about the minds of easily impressionable people could have easily impressed so many people. This film is a warning about the type of life style that Tyler prefers, doesn't anybody seem to get that? Perhaps it was the creator's idea to fashion a film that outlines the downfalls of nihilism, and then create a similar reaction in its viewers. Perhaps the fact that so many people don't seem to understand the true meaning of this film was the intention of the creator. If this is the case than I can recommend the film as a razor sharp satire. If not, then this film falls under the same category as SCARFACE. I say this because both films flirt at length with the corrupt, and then tag on a moral ending that frankly isn't as interesting to the viewers as what came before.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" 139 minutes of my life wasted.
",,"As a main character says ""This is your life, and it's ending one minute at a time.""  That's how I felt for most of this film which essentially steals its premise from the 1987 film ""Angel Heart"".  The performances of the lead actors all top notch, but the execution of the story is almost painful to watch.  Sure, there's plenty of commentary on our current socio/economic state, but does that necessarily make it insightful or brilliant? If lots of bare knuckle fighting and bleeding really pops your cork, then this is the film for you.  But if you're looking for a strong story with a real hero, such as in the first 2 Rocky movies or Van Damme's Bloodsport then keep on looking.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" good movie, book is better
",,"While I used to consider this movie to be my #1 pick, that has shifted to magnolia. The movie is still good, and I like it just as much as before. However after reading the book, it just seems flat.  Life is a series of comparisons, and while comparing this movie to other movies it's #1, but comparing this movie to other messages that I find through media, it's not, simply because the book's message is way better, with a lot more depth. Fight club was #1 in my book due to its original meaning but now that I found this meaning expanded upon in another medium, fight club has shrunk. There is just a lot more to it.  A lot.  I don't think the characters, especially Marla, are well developed.  Upon seeing the movie for the first time I had a feeling like Marla was supposed to be a big part of it, but she wasn't.  From the start he even says ""all this is because of marla"" or something like that.  But in fact, it wasn't really expanded upon at all. There were a lot of other things too, the whole #69 thing was rather pointless.  And just little things throughout. I'd still give it a 10/10 for sure, I would just recommend reading the book over watching the movie (but doing both works too).",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Rebels without a cause.
",spoiler,"It's very impressive visually, nicely directed, well acted, scripted in a literate way, and immeasurably depressing.I suppose the plot has been covered in detail elsewhere so I'll keep it brief. The narrator (Edward Norton)is a bored, anomic insomniac who doesn't know why he's alive. He runs into a creepy and insulting babe (Helena Bonham Carter) who seems to care about nothing. Then he meets a brutally honest Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who seems to see through everything and everyone, who actively hates and engages in combat against modern ennui and phoniness, and things start to pop. Pitt and the narrator found Fight Club in which men who would otherwise be leading lives of quiet desperation get to pound the crap out of one another. Fight Club franchises spring up everywhere as men search for their lost cojones. Pitt becomes a cult leader and wages war against corporate art with homemade explosives. The upshot of all this, I won't reveal.I didn't like it at all. At first I thought it was going to turn into one of those Gallic philosophical conundrums with a lot of pointless non sequiturs in the foreground. (Narrator: Is Tyler Durden in my dream? Or am I in his?"") Then it appeared to morph into an excuse for more bloodshed and violence. And then it got really twisted. I never realized a guy could shoot off a large-caliber pistol in his mouth and carry on a normal conversation five minutes later.It will, I suppose, be claimed that this is an original -- in contrast to the formulaic rubbish ground out by Hollywood these days. True enough, but it's not all THAT original. Proving your masculinity by enduring punishment? Is there a Rambo movie in which Stallone doesn't bleed, or get himself dipped in pig excrement, or electrocuted half to death, without flinching? In the stockade, in James Jones' ""From Here to Eternity,"" the guards treat the inmates with unspeakable brutality. So what do the prisoners do to prove their transcendance of authority? They beat hell out of each other, in games, in ways that the guards wouldn't have the imagination to dream up. Not to mention a hundred movies about The Big House and POWs and slaves biting their tongues during whippings.The punishment within the group is only part of the story, of course. It leads to a consideration of secret cults and their desire to rid the world of credit cards. We've had that before too, with Charlie Manson and the Reverend Jim Jones. And if Tyler Durden is going to insult the narrator by calling him ""Ikea Boy"", and if the group is going to assault society by demolishing icons like Starbucks, don't they have some kind of obligation to provide more constructive icons? Shouldn't they have some sense of beauty, truth, and logic that takes them beyond moral nihilism? Or is the movie actually saying that Western civilization SHOULD be destroyed? The film is ugly to watch, partly because the message itself is so banal, and partly because the imagery is so repulsive. The back of somebody's head is blown off. Human fat is boiled down to make soap. Fight Club members lives in an abandoned house near a toxic waste dump amid unutterable squalor. They don't seem to change clothes. (The narrator shows up for work at his office with his own blood on his shirt.) They don't bathe. Brad Pitt shuffles around in a filthy bathrobe wearing a pair of lady's slippers with clotted fur around the tops, as Doris Day might appear during a trip on battery acid. It isn't that I find such voluntarism necessarily bad. I'm sitting here writing this, wearing only a sarong and a pair of eyeglasses in the middle of the desert. But doesn't bodily filth reach a point at which it becomes intolerable to the self, never mind the person you're trying to sell your homemade soap to? Mostly, though, what a beastly message. If you want to swagger around, a member of a cult, dealing out summary punishment to those whose values aren't your own, why not join Blackwater or some other mercenary group and at least get paid more than one thousand dollars a day. Or if you really want to get in your face with respect to bourgeois verities, give away everything you have and serve soup to the homeless at St. Anthony's Dining Room. Or vote Libertarian? Or become a Theravada Buddhist monk, earning merit and living on alms? I guess, though, that nothing like that is going to get your testosterone pumping and that's what concerns this movie. Know when blood testosterone levels peak in men? During late adolescence, when our fantasies are even more limited than our brain power.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I'm Against It
",spoiler,"After watching Fight Club, and before writing this comment here I have watched it 6 times myself alone to find out why it got so many ratings and votes from the audiences. Just after 2000 I had watched lots and numerous movies existing in the world, but so far no single comments are available here in this IMDb. Now I am in bound to express my personal feelings about this unnecessarily overrated movie. I find nothing special in this dumb and irritating Fight Club starring Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Why did this movie got good stars and many comments? Just because others are dancing and so they too blindly dancing with them after getting into the story of Tyler Durden?David Fincher - I think David is good at making movies based on mental sickness, human illusion and social understanding. He could have used the actors in better perspective to make the whole story clearer than it is. Fight Club - This movie was actually flopped when it released theatrically worldwide. So can we really consider it as a hit or blockbuster? No doubt, it got momentum when it later came out in DVD. I was mostly displeased with the twisting climax, which has nothing special to thrill the human mind. It is just simple to predict in some points of the story. There are some scenes which make bored and eagerly wait to move forward in the next scenes. This is not a case with good thrillers like The Bourne trilogy series, The Peacemaker, Collateral Jeepers Creepers, The Recruit, Paycheck, The Shooter, The Departed or say Impostor . For my 8 years of continuously watching different types of movies and analysing the choices of the audiences, I came to confusion why audiences really admired this movie! Well, it might have became a cult-film for creating the ideas of building 'fight club's but this movie actually has a negative and improper purposes. The twisted ending seems to be much dissatisfying in catching the truth. But in fact, the movie has no concern with the world's reality.Brad Pitt - I wonder why Brad Pitt accepted the role as an illusionary Tyler Durden who rule the narrator's way of living. Surprisingly he turned out as non-existing person who appears from schizophrenic narrator Jack (Norton). I like Pitt a lot his role in Kalifornia and Se7ven and Mr & Mrs Smith, but not here.Edward Norton - I was really impressed by his role in only 2 hits - Rounders and The Italian Job. But this time also he won my heart for his innocence and ignorant role as Jack. He did his role as demanded by the script and the director or the producers. He was a right choice for this role better than others.Helena Bonham Carter - She does not have the necessary looks to become a star or celebrity, but by chance she got good remarks for her role here. No impressions exist from her role as Marla Singer but only to look once.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Bad ... Scary Bad
",,"If you're looking to waste an evening with over-indulgent tripe then this just might be the film for you. David Fincher has made an entire career out of making films that cater to the lowest common denominator and the basest of instincts and with ""Fight Club"" he outdoes himself. What's worse than Fincher's ham-fisted direction is the performance of the non-actors Brad Pitt and Edward Norton. Everything they do tends to either be over-the-top bad or so very unforgettable as to almost be non-existent.

" I once saw a DVD going into the trash can at home...
",,"I voted this movie be 1/10 stars on this website, which is way to much for a movie like this. I didn't like the atmosphere in the film at all. Beating each other without any reasonable reason. Besides that there were lots of blasphemic things in this movie in combination with very violent language.I think filmmakers show that they are incompetent by using a script that contains lots of violent words. Why... would you might think right now. Almost all real good movies like Gladator, The Green Mile, Lord of the Rings and The Shawshank Redemption show us that you create atmosphere by good acting and story telling...therefore you don't need actors to use blasphemic language all the time.This movie was bought by a friend of mine and we watched it at his home. We both got so sick and tired to watch this crap that he opened the DVD player even before the movie actually ended and broke the DVD. We went smoking outdoors...but my evening was truly spended on a movie worthless to see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" More like dance club

I'd rather watch a pokemon fight then those two weak fruity actors fight (but Brad was OK in Ocean 11 and 12 monkeys). Plus the whole plot is just way over the top. It tries to appeal to a smart audience, but I think it can only appeal to a dumb one. This film total insults Capitalism and America. It tries to make some political statements, but it is just a 2 hour piece of garbage. I should have known better than to rent this weak movie. The movie cover simply has a picture of a bar of pink soap! That should have told me not to watch it, but since the reviews were kind of good, I rented it anyway.

" Great movie yes! but its useless FOOL's GOLD
",,"Honestly this movie marks some fresh and new to cinema. Great film making style and plot. Direction and cast was good too.But here comes the boom.....this film represents the modern era where anything can be sold to the fools just by advertising and wrapping it in a catchy packing.So while watching this movie i was feeling as if i am getting sick literally but i just watched it because of its high rating. The film talks about releasing self from limitations and lack of emotional strength, so far so good, but a dying patient can't be cured by hypnosis. It is a useless effort. Now our patient is dying, death is playing its game and his relatives around him....all those who loved the movie....thinks that due to hypnosis their beloved patient is not crying that means not feeling pain that means getting cured. Now that's what i call FOOL's GOLD. Honestly again but i am not buying this stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A Movie For Wilted Wieners
",,"Snarl! - Snarl! - Snap! - Snap!.....Attention! Attention! Calling all infantile-minded, emotionally immature, adult males who get their jollies playing dress-up in military drag!.... Welcome to the Wilted Wiener Club (aka. Fight Club).You know, I can't believe what a damning statement this demented, little movie makes about the insecurity of today's man and his obvious doubts about his own masculinity. If this film's story wasn't so pathetic it would actually be quite laughable.I find it really quite disturbing and, yes, frightening that the movie Fight Club (which started out at such an ultra-low, base-level mentality as it did) never-ever once rose above that revoltingly stupid level of thought - Not even once.And, finally - I don't care one, single bit about what any adoring, little fan may say, or think, about baby-blue-eyes Brad Pitt(head). 'Cause, let's face it - PITT IS A TERRIBLE ACTOR. He is!I mean, if he really had any talent at all, then he would've rescued this utter piece of junk-food from the dregs of the garbage disposal with his ""magnetic"" charisma.

" Clearly I'm not in the target audience
",,"It's been a good 15 years since I've seen ""Fight Club"", and it never really did anything for me back then (well there is that ""gotcha!"" ending, but that's about all that stuck in my brain). Now, at 35, it does even less. It's not that I don't ""get"" the movie, but I'm leaving that door open just for argument sake.It's mostly a middle finger to the establishment, gift-wrapped for adolescents. Usually, when a movie's satirizing something, it's engaging, maybe even funny. But by the time Brad Pitt says ""The things you own end up owning you"", it's obnoxious. I got that this is railing against consumerism, desk-jockey angst, ennui, whatever you want to call it (hell, the bursts of '90s CGI drove that point home with a battering ram), but when these people keep yammering on about it, subtlety's a distant memory. You can taste the smugness.

" Stupefying beyond belief; Fight Club is a messy spectacle of ugliness, exposition and crass ideologies playing out under a broad banner of mainstream entertainment.
",,"I read that Fight Club is a ""man's film"", whatever that means. Truth be told, it's a little boy's film, a messy; scrappy; clawing; pseudo-philosophical piece of turgid nonsense lapped up by people who see a music video aesthetic crossed with their favourite actors churned out of this contemporary Hollywood star system we have that just happens to dabble in some meek philosophy: bums and nobodies like the ones in the film will find its gimmicky pretences enthralling, appealing and quite interesting. For the rest of us, this is lecturing nonsense from a writer whom ought to have all his pens, pencils and word processors taken away from him. The film's entire thesis is captured in a sequence in which, at the fight club of the title, the store owner comes down into his own shop's basement to question what everyone's doing. After some grief from Durden, he beats him before eventually being subdued himself by a blood soaked Durden slobbering all over him. The owner runs off; suddenly attuned to allowing the club to remain and all he needed to arrive at this point is a good fight of some description. That's it; that's all you need to know right there – the rest is nonsense of the highest order.The film plays out under this facade of post-modern trickery and modern movie making gimmicks, thus rendering it ""accessible""; but the fact we're expected to swallow this infantile babble about how difficult it is to be a blank, bummed out nobody; a thug, a vandal, whose lives are in the dank state they are because they never found any particular field in which they could excel, is pathetic. The film was David Fincher's fourth, but he will not churn out a worser piece of cinematic drek in his life than the adolescent, preening nonsense that is Fight Club. The piece is essentially one long flashback and is narrated by Edward Norton's nameless character. When we first see him, he has a gun in his mouth and finds himself in an area chock full of explosives courtesy of Brad Pitt's Tyler Durden. Norton initially I.D's himself as a slave to consumerism; an unexciting office worker who comes to find solace in fighting and violence with other men in an organised fight ring from whence the title derives. But in Durden, a frightening character is created: a thug, a vandal, a terrorist but a role model; an individual whose manic hair style; cool looking shades; extravagant dress sense; sexual habits and natural charisma paints positive characteristics in an individual that ought to be anything but. Durden sees himself as a saviour; a liberator; an army general whom leads his troops and encourages them to break the shackles of life; someone whom frees and liberates via terror, as exemplified in a scene set in a convenience store car park in which he threatens to execute a young store worker if he doesn't return to education. All this leads to a sickening finale, an end that carries a highly romanticised, emotionally heavy sensibility about it as bombs go off and two people embrace.The film is from the pen of Jim Uhls by way of Chuck Palahniuk's novel, the film is Palahniuk's inane babbling against the machine; his banal, inane ranting and raving of which the arguments in the film are put across by way of nothing more than childish expositional tidbits on behalf of Pitt's character: ""The things you own end up owning you"" is a sample. In stark comparison to Norton's grey suit; blank shirt-clad and office booth based character, the one he shares most screen time with, Durden is a dangerously vibrant explosion of colour and energy. Later, there's a reason for all this hopping about in characteristics and mannerism as well as the restrictions in the Norton-Pitt interaction; but in itself, opens up a number of problems as to how they can be in separate places at once and how on Earth one person can know about one item (such as the whereabouts of the human fat) with the other seemingly oblivious to all links to it.Make no mistake, the film is the clawing ramblings of someone with some serious issues. In attempting to wage a war on consumerism, we get plenty in the way of product placement for companies such as Pepsi and Apple Macintosh; its approach sees a world initially filtered through the psyche of an insomniac in Norton's character, before support groups and false emotion helps cure that and a character named Marla (Carter) push it back to the forefront again. Is there a need for her character? Marla's presence opens up a sub-plot to do with her own problems of suicidal ideation and a fling she has with Durden which is entirely pointless. After a while, the film realises her presence is futile; that the piece is meant to be about the relationship of its two lead men, their masculinity and their relationship with other men, scrapping her for more inane tangents that run off on separate strands.The whole thing is as empty headed and crass as it sounds, this underground fight ring escalating from a celebration of pain, violence and all things grimy and nasty into a tale of a terrorist group full of 'misunderstood' philistine-infused males. In creating an ugly film about ugly people with ugly views, but filtering it by way of sporadic philosophy and sociology with an accessible aesthetic in its MTV-style appearance, Fincher has crafted a text he's most certainly above. It's nonsense of the worst kind; the sort of nonsense that has an eye on being labelled as something higher than first appears, addressing people in society doing what's deemed menial jobs before actually becoming someone in the ring during which battering and bruising someone else is the answer to life's problems. It's babble; babble of the most patronising and disorganised, sporadic order; a maddening and dulling faux-intellectual piece of nonsense.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Brilliant acting, a famous twist but still overrated
",,"Yes, this one is are very good and entertaining movie with an interesting twist, not the best one in film history as some people say but still a quite good one, and a good acting of the two brilliant main characters without any doubt.What I dislike about the film is its slow paced introduction which I found somehow long and boring, the idea of the fight club and its intentions itself and that the whole thing seems logic to its members, the somehow exaggerated end and the fact that you don't get to know what the whole sense or intention of the terroristic organisation has to mean or not to mean in the end.All in all, this one of the movies you should have watched once in your life and which you should know to make yourself an opinion. This one is very popular and many friends from different countries are quite often talking about this movie so you should watch it to be able to discuss about it. I'm one of the rare people who don't give 9 or 10 points because I know weirder non mainstream movies with better twist, but from the popular ones of the genres, this one may be the most interesting movie and become somehow a kind of drug you get addicted to which may introduce you to other movies of the genre, for example the movies of David Lynch or Shyamalan or the real underground stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Powerful, mind-bending and dark film.
",,"The first rule of Fight Club is that you do not talk about Fight Club. But in this case, I can't help but break that rule.If you're looking for a happy, all-is-well film, you'd better turn around and walk away. Right at the beginning, the film kicks off by introducing an intense situation, and it only goes downhill from there. Immediately the audience is hooked and wants to know more. From the title, many people assume that this movie is all about fighting, and so they discard it, but it's really about much more than that. Consumerism, anti-sociality, and sociopathic behaviours are covered and supplement the film nicely.An insomniac is the center of this film. Norton plays this insomniac, who also happens to have an everyman job, everyman boss, and basically an everyman life. What's not to like? Although we don't get this information right away, it does shape the basis for the film. He loves his home and his furniture, but soon his life turns upside down.The characters are witty and clever. Norton's character's voiceovers come at just the right moment, supplementing the dark moments of the film with humour, and Brad Pitt's character is anything but a cardboard cut-out. They both evolve, along with Helena Bonham Carter's character, at a good pace, which keeps the audience constantly interested. Still on this topic, the acting and portrayal of the three main characters is superbly done; in my opinion, the best was Edward Norton. Genuine surprise, guilt, and overall acting.All in all, Fight Club is definitely a film to check out.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" The Greatest Cult Film of All-Time?
",,"""That old saying, how you always hurt the one you love? Well, it works both ways."" – NarratorWhile it flopped upon its initial release and received Luke-warm reviews at best, ""Fight Club"" has worked its way over the years to becoming perhaps the biggest and best cult film of all time. Directed by David Fincher (""The Curious Case of Benjamin Button"") the film is as famous for its unique visual style as it is for its nihilistic and dark comedic tone. Its tale of anarchy was, in a way, a refreshing slap to the face of the mainstream, which is what makes it such a beautiful and unique film, and it still holds up just as well today, over ten years later.Starring Edward Norton as the Narrator, ""Fight Club"" tells the story of a man living in a sterilized environment, suffering from insomnia and yearning to unleash his pent-up angst. He doesn't know why he can't sleep and perhaps he is going crazy, but things only get more interesting when he stumbles upon an interesting character in Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) who essentially resembles everything he himself is not. United, they take to the underground and form a fight club where grown men can come and pummel the snot out of one another in good fun. Things take a turn for the worse, though, when Tyler's plans get out of hand and a troubled woman (Helena Bonham-Carter) comes between the two conflicted personalities.The film is drawn from a bold novel by Chuck Palahniuk and is about as anti-Hollywood as a major studio film can be. Edward Norton breaks through in perhaps his finest role to date, capturing all the humor and melodramatic baggage that comes with the character exquisitely, while Brad Pitt gets a chance to go over the top in a way that few actors can handle. The film is over two-hours long, but is paced just right so that you lose track of time and feel immersed in the narrative each and every time. No doubt, it's one of Fincher's finest films and one of the best examples of film in the 1990's. Even after the twist has revealed itself, ""Fight Club"" is a movie worth coming back to time and time again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Very unique.
",,"Now, believe me when I say, Fight Club is hands down one of the most complex, thematically-rich films of the 90s. It's this decade's most profound piece of movie making as well as being one of this decade's most original. Unfortunately, due to its uniqueness, an audience will be hard to pinpoint. The same target audience that it speaks to also might not understand its deep-seated themes. Fight Club is one of those rare films that has so much to say that one viewing will not be able to absorb all of it. The acting is superb and enviable. All of the characters in the movie have something to say that adds to the development of the story. The camera work and graphics are outstanding. The effects are useful at grabbing the viewer's attention. As I said earlier, this movie is truly unique. It's not a corny underdog story about some man fighting to get a girl or prove a point. But it is the uprising of one particular class of underlying men who feel they are ""the middle child of god"". Fight club relies on it's wit, shock value and dialogue to create a controversial atmosphere that holds the viewer's attention. There are so many underlying morals and messages in this story, it's almost impossible to pin point all of them. I truly recommend watching this film, I give it a 9/10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Had to be ignored by Oscar, but was never forgotten by youngsters.
",,"When I saw a movie like Fight Club, it came to me that maybe the society and its critics, consensus and medias are too superficial. And, maybe it's the underground things that ruled.Don't call me crazy, cause that's the situation Fight Club met in the 10 years of its releasing. A lot of people blamed the Oscar for ignoring it, but I don't think that's necessary. Because, that's the way this movie worked. It's transmitting negative, anti-social and extreme ideologies to people, so by any means you shouldn't give it an Oscar. That's how the whole society and movie industry keep their agreement. But, don't worry. Fight Club found its own way to our minds. The movie is a trousers-striper who striped the trousers of the consumerism society and everyone who enjoyed themselves in it silently. So, if you feel offended by Fight Club, congratulations! It meant you are in the mainstream and doesn't need a change. If, more fortunately, you are encouraged and enlightened by Fight Club, congratulations again. It means you are exactly the targeted audiences of this crazy movie, and you 've just found your therapy group. It looked like there are hardly a middle-way, if you talk it in front of the public, that you have to either disapprove it or approve it. That's why I liked it.Nowadays people laugh at you if you try to reason with them by biblical teachings. So maybe sometimes they need something more ""explosive"" and ""dynamic"" to challenge their life-time values. Shake it baby! Shake your head or your heart! Anyway this movie delivered, and could be taught for good.Mr. Fincher, you should give more stuff like this. Don't worry about the critics and the terrorists. They will be entertained as well.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" One of the best films of the 90's
",,"I did not know what to expect from Fight Club, but I gave it a try since I am a fan of Fincher's films Se7en, Zodiac, and the more recent The Curious Case of Benjamin Button. This film surprised me in it's style and tone. It has a very inventive narration and surreal images that only help make us go deeper into Edward Norton's character and his mind. I can safely say there are not too many films like this. The main premise seems simple, two men create a combat group that soon turn into a large cult or society. Although it is simple, the film's choices and execution are not simple. I was confused by a lot on this film, and I am sure this is a film I will have to watch more than once, but I was deeply invested in these characters. I felt the reason for the main characters' choices and the struggle with their lives that they felt they needed to overcome, and the only way to do that was by fighting, not for winning or losing, but to feel important and feel more absorbed in the practice of it all. Very original idea. I thought the writing was sensational, a lot of very thought-provoking ideas and dialogue in the film. I did not know what to expect, but the twist actually shocked me. I have seen a lot of films with twists similar to this, but the film executed it in a unique way and thought it fitted well. David Fincher's direction seemed more confident and mature here than in any other of his films. I cannot believe the screenplay writer from this also wrote Jumper(WOW). The performances here were brilliant. Norton was great, but the ones who truly shined were Pitt and Carter. I always feel both these actors, especially Helena, create some truly fantastic characters, and this is no exception. I did not always think Pitt was a capable actor, but with films like The Assassination of Jesse James, Benjamin Button and Burn After Reading from 2008, he has proved he is great. I am surprised neither Carter or Pitt got many awards or nominations.I thought Fight Club was fantastic, and in a truly weird sublime way, it was entertaining. Like I said, there were some tricky parts, but I thought it was a film that could be a disaster but had so many elements to it. Probably Fincher's best, along with Benjamin Button (I'll see which stands stronger as time goes by). Along with his other film, Se7en, one of the best of the 90's.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" One of the Elite
",spoiler,"What is Fight Club? Like its main character, it takes on many different identities and seems like quite the epic journey to self-realization. Sometimes it's an action flick. Other times it's a thriller. Maybe even a light comedy, and it's all thrown into a philosophical masterpiece. Fight Club tells the story of the narrator (Edward Norton) whose life is in turmoil due to an extreme case of insomnia. He turns to self-help groups, which cures his insomnia because he sees people who are worse than him. The character is never given a name because he cannot attain a true identity. He is lost within the world as another soul with nothing to live for. The director (David Fincher) injects a lot of comedic moments throughout the film that work quite well. It is in fact a dark comedy, for example when they joke about a woman with cancer. Except, even with this subject matter, you find yourself laughing at what she and the narrator says. In turn, you feel disgusted with yourself and find yourself staring eye to eye with Edward Norton's character. He too is disgusted with his entire life and is stuck in this endless cycle. He then meets Tyler Durden, played by Brad Pitt, who seems to know exactly who he is inside. He is everything that people are not, specifically the narrator. I found myself wanting to be Tyler Durden mainly because of the way he handles himself. Brad Pitt's performance is wonderfully captivating as he teeters on becoming a psycho and yet you want to join in with that madness.They both decide to start a fight club in which people fight with one another in order to feel something again in their numbing worlds. The film is definitely geared towards the younger audience, but then again if you dislike the world at points of your life, you can relate. The only real flaw within the film is it gets a little off track. It delves into the excessive and overdone specifically with the ""space monkey"" scenes, but is able to get on again after a while. By the end of the film, the viewer is exhausted as the narrator aimlessly tries to find Tyler again after he leaves him. Although, he doesn't really need to find him ever again. I could tell you why, but that would be breaking the rules of Fight Club. The film successfully uses this plot twist to further its themes, but also add another dimension to the story for the audience.The film is able to work on many levels due to the amount of relating the audience can do with their own life. This is a story about how society is one big commercial. They are rebelling, specifically Edward Norton's character, towards that feeling and creating a new one by feeling a fist against their cheekbone. They are all so infuriated that by the end of the film, they watch the credit card buildings burn down to the ground. But none of them are scared, they know who they are and that's all that matters. The film touches on so many different subjects and tries to cover every reach of the human emotion. This is its brilliance and pitfall. It overreaches at some points, but grabs hold of something much greater at others. The film makes the viewer think on a grand scale and gives them questions. I still haven't been able to shake it off even after ten viewings. By the end of the film you won't be asking yourself what is Fight Club, but who am I?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" ""This is your life and it's ending one minute at a time.""
",,"The first rule of Fight Club is to not talk about Fight Club...but it's hard to follow when the movie is this good.Some movies follow the basic psychological structure of every day people, however, Fight Club takes you to corners of your imagination that you were too afraid to even get close to.The plot? Very simple yet complicated. A man meets the man of his dreams and together they put together a way for men to relieve stress, its called Fight Club and the name of it says it all, they just fight. However that is only the crust of this very thick plot. I would dive more into it but you'll have to watch to find out.The acting was first class. Edward Norton was flawless as The Narrator, the man who goes through his unsatisfying life wishing he could do something exceptional. Brad Pitt was perfect as Tyler Durden, the man of the Narrator's dreams who helps the Narrator pull himself and his ideas/dreams together. Helena Bonham Carter was exceptional as Marla Singer, the crazy/gritty/disgusting woman who seems to be a burden on The Narrator. Meat Loaf delivered an otherwise award-winning performance as Bob, the physically and mentally deformed man who is so disgusting yet lovable.The plot had more twists and knots than an old rope.

" Fight Club
",,"Fight Club I was recommended about this 1999 movie by my office colleague Bill Piccolo. It sounded like a typical boxing ring movie to me  but due to the eagerness of suggestion, I thought of viewing it right away on the borrowed DVD.This is a shocker of a movie! You could hate it or love it. My thoughts were shifting on the scales from one extreme to the other  what is going on? What is the purpose of the movie? What is the message of the movie? What does it want to convey? I had to sleep over the movie before I sat down to write this review.The movie is about the main protagonist guy  Edward Norton playing an insomniac, who comes in touch with first with Marla Singer  played by Helena Carter  and later on with the dynamo of a guy - Tyler Durden  played brilliantly by Brad Pitt in his bigger than screen performance. From that time  the movie takes a roller coaster ride to unbelievable incidences, situations and thought processes that churn the mind out of the viewers. Brad Pitt and Edward Norton set up a ""fight club"" that grows into many cities around US and becomes an underground mayhem causing outfit. There is a final twist  like all the classic movies have; that builds up the scope for me to view it again and again! I think that this is a fantastic movie. Not by the sense of acceptance of what is going on in the movie  but the narration of a concept that is so weird. I like movies because it takes one to those areas of human beings that are not dwelled in before. Many attempts are made to showcase a dark side of human nature  not many are successful in doing that. But the director David Fincher  (Alien 3, Se7en, Game and Panic Room) has created a dynamo of this movie. Hats off to this brilliant young director! A lot of effort must have gone in preparing for this cult movie. Small details that are obviously missed during the first viewing would be revealed after 2-3 viewing  once you know the ending.Edward Norton has played his role to perfection (I had seen him recently in The Illusionist and found him stone faced), Brad Pitt takes the guts out of you and his larger than life persona would be remembered for many years and accomplished actress Helena Carter plays her role with mysterious oomph and style  great trio on work.The best part of the movie  if you miss it during the first viewing is its background sound track. Please pay special attention to it  it carries several messages of the final twists embedded into the sound track.It is a male dominated movie but the other sex who love different and new cinema would also love it. I would surely highly recommend to all movie-buffs friends.Jut a trivia  this movie is rated number 31 in all time classic lists of 250. Does not that say a lot about the movie?

" Unique concept
",,"Perhaps it's the concept of the movie itself which hold the viewer throughout. Some of the stunts during fight sequences are particularly well done...and obviously, the sound is excellent...witness awards.While it seems to grow more and more outlandish, the viewer is captivated by the very basis of the movie. This is one of those movies that would never fall in a top ten list, yet it is memorable in the same vein as ""The Usual Suspects.""One can fault Brad Pitt, perhaps, for a bit of overacting. And the female characters are underdeveloped. But, after all, this is touted as a ""guy's"" movie. Yet, the concept is so unique...I wish I could give it away. Other mini-summaries had trouble explaining it as well, without giving away the essence of the movie, which is really NOT about ""fight clubs.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Drunk too much punch...
",,"Take away Pitt's perfect physique... This film enables the viewer to submerge into an ocean of cynicism and desperation. If you find it irresistibly trendy to let go of any hope or optimism, preferring to celebrate disappointment with the no-show ""perfect world"" some idiot parent promised you, and wallow in self-pity presented with a facade of fashionable violence, then this film is for you. Knock yourself out. I'd stop now if IMDb didn't require a longer review... Production quality, acting, editing, etc. for this film is all first-rate Hollywood. First-rate Hollywood...now that's a good thing, right?

" Something very rare...
",,"It is a rare thing that there is a book that I really love and when I finally see the film made of that book that I think that film is up to scratch. Fight Club, however, cracks it! I loved the book, and although I was quite late seeing the film and quite apprehensive to see it as It thought it could ruin the book for me forever when I did see, I loved it just as much if not more.Brilliantly Acted by a perfectly chosen cast, the film is a violent film and will shock many but, as most think, this film isn't just about violence, it is about something important. Come to this film with an open mind and prepare to have something to think about because thats the kind of film it is. This really isn't just a violence-fest with no significance or plot, it is a truly superb film.An all time favourite of many, including myself and a film you really should see..",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Recently named tthe fourth best movie of all-time in a British magazine poll.
",,"I write this review because today I saw that Fight Club was named the 4th best movie of all time in a poll done by a British magazine ( the magazine wasn't named in the AP report). And this led me to question. How good is Fight Club? Seeing as how by now there has been several standard reviews of this movie I need not go into what the plot is or how superb the acting, directing, or scriptwriting was, but I think this recent poll and all the internet clamor surrounding this movie leads me to ask another question. Why has Fight Club become such a watershed movie? Fight Club has the interesting distinction of being both underrated and overrated. When it came out it was largely underrated, which is odd since it came under a cloud of criticism for its violent subject matter and it starred two of the biggest Hollywood Stars then as well as now. But this movie really only hit critical mass until it went to Video and DVD. Fight Club found its fan base amongst a lot of adolescent men who pretty much dug the concepts being thrown around. It was philosophical without being over anyone's head, and it was intelligent without being hard to digest. In short it was exactly what it rails against: a perfectly portioned package. It is and was a seminal movie that not only struck a chord with a generation of people, but also managed to be damn funny.Fight Club is a great movie, but I do believe it has become a victim of its own success. Now people who watch this movie claim to inhabit it and literally worship the precepts espoused by it, ultimately, missing the whole point of the movie, which is the pursuit of honesty at all cost isn't enough of a sacrifice to truly be free. In the end you're just going to have eat a little crap. If you become obsessed with the fakeness of the world you are just as guilty of making it your master. But of course that interpretation as with others is completely subjective. I wish people could just watch this film and marvel at the story structure and laugh at the humor, because anything else is taking this movie entirely too seriously. And for the record Fight Club might deserve to be in the Top 100, but number 4 all time is pushing it!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Surprisingly smart and stylish
",,"Two of the best actors out there, Brad Pitt(12 Monkeys) and Edward Norton(American History X), star in this fast paced and brutal look on men who hate what they do. It focuses on one main man(of whom we never know the real name of), Edward Norton, he's an insomniac and hasn't slept for six months. He finds out that by letting out his feelings and crying let him sleep like a baby, but when his plans are disrupted by an addicted smoker Marla(Carter), he goes right back to sleep deprivation. Norton works for a major car company whose cars aren't exactly the safest in the world. His job is to travel around the country and investigate the problems the cars are having. On one of his flights, he meets a very interesting soap salesman named Tyler Durden(Pitt). The two become friends and end up living together in a rundown old house on Paper street. To get out their anger and just let loose, they have boxing matches every week, they find it exciting. But their fun starts to attract more and more working stiffs like themselves, and soon enough, they end up having a club in an underground basement of a bar every night of the week. The club soon becomes a cult of rage, brutality, self-destruction, and mischief. Pitt gives a strong, odd, and highly charismatic performance. He makes it just that much more fun to watch. Norton gives a very solid performance as the everyday man turned insane loose cannon. Director David Fincher's style with his movies are exquisite. His trademark cinematography and the cool, sleek music make his films fun. Ed Norton always seems to give an absolutely awesome performance in whatever he does, I believe he is one of the greatest actors out there right now. Although if it wasn't for Pitt, this film probably would have been more of an independent other than a blockbuster. All in all, 'Fight Club' is a disturbingly brutal, smart, violent, darkly funny, cool flick. It's flawless performances, swift music, cinematography, and deeply smart story make this movie a classic in my mind.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club a Metaphor for Life
",,"Fight Club without a shadow of a doubt is an incredible film, but what intrigues me most about it is not the sharp direction or the hard fight scenes but more the well written and analysed script. My favourite line is this, ""Now a question of etiquette: As I pass, do I give you the ass or the crotch"" This line is a incredible. The woman blocking Tyler is a problem in life which must either be faced with the ass or the crotch. Also the theory that everything on a plane is single-serving is incredible as it is absolutely true. Watch Fight Club for a clearer view of life and how it is seen through the eyes of an insomniac, club addict who is brilliantly played by Edward Norton.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" hit me!!

Edward Norton playing the normal, yet miserably boring ""good one"", while brad Pitt is the rebel, the one with a mind of his own, and the one who offers ed's character a way out. but this film is not a boring drama just described, the plot twists and turns in between the brutal (and they are cringeworthingly brutal at times) fights all the way up to the shocking end. this film is like many of the classics, to understand fully its meanings and views on our modern society then you must (MUST!) watch this film a few times, or you will miss so much more then you think. one more piece of valuable advice: watch...this...film!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The first rule of this movie is you don't write reviews about this movie
",,"The Renaissance sculptor Rodin said, a great work of art can still be seen as a great work of art, even if it is broken or incomplete.Nothing more typifies this than Fight Club. I could list all the problems, plot holes, human psychology errors etc with this movie (and I haves watched this movie many times so I know what they are). However that would give away most of the plot and the plot twists.However balancing this is an incredibly challenging, exciting, funny and interesting film that works on so many different levels.Edward Norton plays the every man character. Single, with a successful job that he hates and he knows is reinforcing corporate evil. He has a condo and all the IKEA furniture that a space monkey would want.But he suffers from insomnia and he finds the perfect cure, attending support groups for things like testicular cancer. There he meets another ""tourist"" Marla, a crazy girl who has accepted that she could die at any time, but is angry that she doesn't.From this he is rescued by Tyler. Tyler is everything he wants to be. Handsome (played by Brad Pitt), dresses the way he wants to dress, does the things he wants to do and (how to say this politely) performs the act of coitus in the way he wants to.Tyler drags him into Planet Tyler. Starting fight club creates a phenomenon. Men fight, men are bonded by fighting, not by shopping. Tyler has a plan and before you know it a revolution has started.Any good revolutionary knows that revolutions require the ordinary people of the world. They are the people who drive you ambulances, serve you food, watch your house when you sleep at night.This movies manages to disturb, excite, educate and entertain all at the same time. People have even started their own ""fight clubs"". But remember, in this movie Tyler is a extreme of the everyman dream. He sees the total destruction of the world, both in terms of destroying the institutions of society and in destroying the future by rejecting women. All so he can be ""a man"".Tyler is not the voice of reason, merely a clever argument in the search for yourself.Your project Mayhem assignment for this week is to start a fight with a complete stranger and lose.

" Surrealistic Dreams
",,"******SPOILERS****** The movie ""Fight Club"" starts off where it's about to end as Jack the narrator, Edward Norton, looking the worst for ware, recites his story that led him up to where it got him to that point.Living the life of a 90's yuppie, enslaved by his job and his material possessions, Jack developed a very bad case of insomnia due to the hours he worked and lifestyle he led that made him go for medical attention. Going to see a doctor for p Jack is told that his insomnia is not the end of the world. If he wants to see real suffering to go to a testicular cancer support group and what he sees and hears from those unfortunates there would make him forget he problems. Taking the doctors advice Jack go to that support group and is struck by the suffering that those inflicted by that terrible disease go through. He develops a friendship with one of the members of that group Big Bob Paulson, Meat loaf, a former body builder. Because of his heavy steroid use Big Bob not only lost his testicles to cancer but his wife and two sons as well as his money. Not only did Jack feel he was doing something constructive, by crying along with Big Bob, it also help him cure his insomnia. Jack started going to all kinds of support groups during his time off from work and tried to help those needing his support. Jack also helped himself by his very giving comfort and help to those that needed it. At the meetings Jack noticed a woman Marla, Helena Bonham Carter, attending the same meetings that he attended. It became obvious to Jack that she was not suffering the traumas, like testicles cancer, that those at the meetings were suffering from. It also made Jack very conscious of himself who was doing the same thing.All this brought Jack's insomnia back with a vengeance and one night he confronted her about being a ""tourist"" and not being honest in attending these group meetings. Coming to a decision with Marla not to attend the same group meetings they both exchange phone numbers to keep in touch. Later on one of Jack many plane trips, that's part of his job, he finds himself sitting next to a very interesting man Tyler Durden, Brad Pitt. Tyler happens to have the exact same suitcase that Jack has. Tyler is everything that Jack wishes he could be; free independent and not stuck up with the yuppie lifestyle that Jack so much wants to get away from but can't. After the plane lands two things happens to Jack that changes his life forever. His suitcase is missing in the baggage department and when he goes home to his high-rise condo he sees that it was blown to pieces by an explosion. This sets the stage that led him to get closer to Tyler and at the same time to get involved with Tyler's pet project the weekly Fight Club matches. These strange events started in the basement of a local bar and also brought Marla back into Jacks life, for better or for worse. The Fight Club matches also revealed something very deep and personal about Jack that was locked deep in his sub-conscious mind; they changed Jack forever in his thoughts and actions. In depth and surrealistic film about couping with the stress of modern life and how the mind works in ways that we can never understand to get us through situations that seem almost impossible to handle. Explosive ending shows how ones suppressed and constrictive mind can become mightier then the sword when it unleashes itself on an unsuspecting public.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" David Fincher has done it again (badly)
",spoiler,"I can't say if the ending of this film is good or bad, because I've got fed up with it well before the end.David Fincher seems to have a taste for grotesque excess. This can be seen in the Madonna videos he directed; it was plain for all to see in ""Se7en"" (a horrible film) and it is evident again in this film as well.This film is disturbing to watch, but, unlike ""Se7en"", at least it's not revolting. It will be liked by all those who think that, in order to criticise the distorted way in which we live, it's essential that an amount of violence as high as possible be shown and represented graphically, even though it doesn't really add to the story. It's not just the violence: it's the whole film that is unpleasant to watch, for no plausible reason.This is not being original, or visionary, or artistic, or intelligent, thought-provoking, innovative. If you met someone on the street and he punched in the stomach for no apparent reason, how many of you would you say that his action is ""thought-provoking""? Not many, I suppose. This film is the cinematic equivalent of a punch in the stomach by a stranger, but it's a little less subtle.Moreover, this film is also boring, very boring.I'm rather tired of directors that seem to indulge in shocking the public with unrealistic plots and hyperrealistic violence. Clearly, some of those directors have realised that they can play that game and get away with it (plus a lot of critical acclaim and, probably, a good deal of money). Personally, I think that this film is basically nonsensical. I suspect that, as with ""Se7en"", it succeeds in making some people feel trendy because they can stand industrial amounts of imaginative violence. Transgression is the word.Sometimes it's even ludicrous. In the sequence in which Brad Pitt gets beaten by the landlord, after the second punch his face bleeds, but after the third one the blood has disappeared. Miraculous, indeed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Biggest disappointment ever seen.
",,"After reading and hearing so many good things about this movie, Iexpected something slick and well written at least. What I saw wasa loose, sloppy, romanticised portrait of a sociopathicschitzophrenic. The overall silliness of the first five minutes is anindicator that this is not a movie to take too seriously, which is fineif this were any kind of comedy-but it just isn't. It isn't campy, and itisn't funny in any parts. The potential for this film was much higherthan it turned out, especially with all the great talent of so many ofthe actors, and having such a unique idea for the main plot. BradPitt was excellent, as were so many of the supporting actors.Norton was not, but he had an impossible task doing somethingthe screenwriter and director wanted, but which was to be almostnot human at all. He was forced to be both very inhuman andinhumane. If someone is really inhuman, it is difficult for the viewerto empathize unless they have the same tendency of beingsociopathic. An inhumane sociopath is a fascinating film subject,but not if they are robotic. Yes, I'm over 45, but I enjoy many kinds of youthful films, or can atleast see why they are liked. I enjoy a wide variety of artistic,abstract, and strange films, as well as mainstream blockbusters. Ibase my opinion on overall excellence, not on technicalachievement. Actually a movie this bad, but at the same timeinnovative, would have benefitted from being made more lowbudget, without all the expensive scenery, props and specialeffects. Then it might have focused more on humans and havebetter insight into the main character's condition and mind, insteadof being merely hinted at, glossed over, and romanticized. All thegood and bad things that can justifiably be said about this film, themost truthful one that stands out the most is that it is just rawstupidity. I realize it is a fantasy story. But that a wimp like Nortoncould convince a horde of millions (all men-no women by the way,since women in the whole world are apparatently only inanimatesex objects) to convert to some sorry cult with no causes otherthan anarchism and individual brutality, is beyond stupidity. This film does have good technical qualities and some greatacting; and it does have content. Some special effects movieshave no real content or human interaction. This does have somegood content, but it is heavily diluted with bad story writing and toomuch emphasis on a selfish, unknowable character.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Don't expect a masterpiece
",,"As another reviewer noted, I don't understand why this movie has any special appeal to anyone who isn't a teenager. It's not a bad movie and I think I would have probably enjoyed it more if I wasn't expecting  much more. There are indeed some questions asked concerning consumerism and petite bourgeoisie, but they never rise above a dissapointingly basic level. The infamous ""twist"" near the end is not as spectacular as advertised by other reviewers. Not really surrealistic, not really a protest movie, not really a psychological thriller, but something in-between that remains unacomplished. Good but not *that* good.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fear Factor
",,"I think that the majorities' high appraisal for ""Fight Club"" reveals that society as a whole loathes the work force, obviously.  If not, then we come to know them as ""workaholics""--which I can safely say because I am one.On a personal level, I enjoyed ""Fight Club"" a great deal because of the psychological implications throughout, but it also indicates a disturbing theme as blue/white collars buy into the whole Durden philosophy with whole abandon.  The creator of Fight Club signifies the terror of a meaningless existence, especially retaining a Sisyphus-like mentality of waking up, working, eating, sleeping...  In a sense, this Durden figure is the Messiah, liberating the people from thinking for themselves, thus confirming a philosopher's saying that ""people would rather die than to think.""  (I apologize that I cannot deliver the philosopher's name due to my lack of memory.)  With that in mind, the movie also explores the domains of a life that can be possibly achieved once the drudgery of life is melted away, but only first through death.  ""The idea of death, the fear of it, haunts the human animal like nothing else; it is a mainspring of human activity - designed largely to avoid the fatality of death, to overcome it by denying in some way that it is the final destiny of man."" (Ernest Becker in The Denial of Death)  Perhaps the alter ego remained in the narrator's subconscious, but gradually acquiesced as his desires surfaced and overruled the desires of his heart.  Opposingly, the narrator seemed to loathe his secret desires, for it allowed him to do things that procured undesirable effects in reality.  That is where the dynamics of this movie takes play, as a sinister dual personality is comprehended during the narrator's revelation amidst his oblivion.  Henceforth, the audience is understandably enraptured by the subplot of dual personality as well as the nightly releases of a pseudo-masochistic society.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" The best movie of 99
",spoiler,"'Contains Spoilers' What can you say about a movie which has become one of the most notorious of the last few years?Well, it's shocking, funny, dynamic, unforgettable, queasy and original. As with Trainspotting three years ago, David Fincher's latest film burrows deep into your subconscious and stays there.Long after most of the year's releases are collecting dust on the video shelves of the world, Fight Club will still be there, lying dormant in your brain, just waiting for someone to trigger off the collective memory of this grimy, hyper-stunning tale.Edward Norton is Jack, the narrator who, as the story opens, is an insomniac suffering from life in the late 20th century. He exists to collect more must have items from the IKEA catalogue and achieve a nirvana-like completeness.In an attempt to find some sort of feeling in his vaccuum of a life, he starts attending support groups for men with testicular cancer, tuberculosis and the like. Finding comfort in the ""bitch tits"" of Robert Paulson (Meat Loaf), our hero cries his heart out and realises he is still alive after all.Until Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter) arrives that is.Like our narrator, Marla is a tourist. A strung-out harpy of a woman who seeks some meaning to her own meaningless existence.Jack cannot feel happiness while he is aware that there is another imposter in the room so they reach a deal and a bizarre relationship constructed of mutual respect for one another's bizarre interest.When Jack meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) on a flight, his life is turned upside down by the soap salesman with a bizarre dress sense.The besuited hero goes back to his apartment to find the place has been gutted by a gas explosion and so in a fit of desperation, Jack rings Durden.They meet up at a local bar, have a few beers and eventually our numb yuppie gets to stay with Tyler.Before long the two men are living together in one of the most decrepit houses ever seen in a major motion picture. This makes The Bradbury in Blade Runner look like Mimi Rogers' apartment in Someone To Watch Over Me.One night they start clashing in a bar forecourt - no malice in these fisticuffs though. Just the affirmation that both men are alive in a world where consumerism has taken precedence over feeling.The scuffle leads to the eponymous organisation, an underground arena for businessmen, blue collar workers and the like to beat the crap out of each other and feel good about it.Jack starts turning up at work with bruises and the sort of manner that marks him out as a man to be avoided. He starts dressing down, bleeding onto his collar and sporting gashes that make his colleagues back away in fear.And so it goes. Fight Club spreads...The first hour of the movie leads you down one straight, dimly lit path, brilliantly executed with living catalogues creating themselves from thin air, close-ups of gas cookers releasing their invisible cargo to a doom-laden room and just the sort of eye-catching visuals that has made Fincher one of the best directors of his generation.What did it mean to me? Well, like one of the disillusioned masses that seeks solace in the comfort of pre-packaged food, franchise furniture stores and mind numbing TV, this is an epiphany of a film. A jet black comedy that left me feeling sick and in a state of altered consciousness - if you're driving home from the movies afterwards, you may need time to collect your thoughts as this is not one of the movies where you just go and get a burger afterwards, having forgotten the plot by the time you get to the counter.Ironically, Fincher's visuals will be lifted by the very companies he is taking the mickey out of over the next few years and this thorn in the side of the moral majority will achieve cult status on video - after all, everyone will want to freeze frame the subliminal moments when both Tyler and Marla appear.However, if you get the chance, catch this on the big screen with a decent sound system and an open mind.Although the actual bone-splintering fight scenes will leave you felling sick, this is not a movie about fighting. It's a film in which the disillusioned masses, born in a generation of TV and video games without soul, try to make sense of a plastic culture.Even if it means losing their minds in order to do so.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" In a Utopia, ""South Park"" vs. ""Fight Club"" for the Oscar
",,"Mr. Fincher, Congratulations on another coup de gras that undoubtedly takes Hollywood by storm, and raises the blood pressure of the P.C. crowd.  I can not comment on the truth to the novel as I have not read it.  But the version I witnessed was mesmerizing.  The two leads, ironically considered two of Hollywood's leading ""Pretty Boys"" turn in gritty, adept performances that certainly don't ring of ""Pretty Boy"".  Helena Bonham Carter proves she'll do what a role calls for.  The remainder of the prominent cast, in their small but important roles provide the necessary gung-ho to make this movie fly. If they remade ""Terminal Man"", they'd call it ""Fight Club"".  As Brad Pitt calls in the trailer, ""Fight Club"" takes it up a notch.  Those who criticize this movie for it's ""brutality, glorification of violence, love of pain"" are, I'm sure, the same individuals who looked the other way during ""Private Ryan"".  The violence in this movie is pervasive and graphic.  It is not, however, gratutitous or unnecessary.  It sets a tone.  Think ""Clockwork Orange"".  The plot was NOT predictable, thereby thwarting the normal Hollywood method.  I felt like I was watching the European ""The Vanishing"" when it all played out.  And it made me smile and wince.  Smile at the surprise, wince at the gripping story.  Obviously, I thouroughly enjoyed this movie.  And it is not often I think how I can't wait to see it again. To see how the director and cast obviously tipped their hand, and still left me in the dark.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" I am Jack's need for multiple comments
",,"I recently saw Panic Room, which was so commercial it brought up an old question. A question which I thought was interesting enough to write a second Fight Club comment about (trust me, it's the first and only time).So why does a movie attacking consumerism contain the flashiest style you've ever seen? Why is it so spectacular? For the same reason it's loaded with advertising messages (check all those Starbucks cups!). It's not hypocrisy, it's irony. To get the movie's messages to a large audience, it has to be flashy and spectacular, because else we probably wouldn't be watching. We are all part of the same hypocrisy, especially the filmmakers (didn't anybody see the irony in casting pretty-boy Brad Pitt, having him criticize the Calvin Klein-ideal of a man only to show off his hard abs a couple of scenes later?). The film is counter-culture but all counter-culture is part of the culture it's rebelling against. To deny that, to deny this film was made to make money; that would've been hypocritical. What it does instead, is realise the inherent problem in adapting a book into an art form that is almost by definition commercial (you can't afford to make movies nobody's willing to pay to see) and play into that. It exaggerates Hollywood conventions to a level where it's kind of ridiculous. It doesn't attack the stylistics themselves but our preoccupation with seeing them (much like it doesn't attack personal property but consumerism instead - there's a significant difference). It gives us what we want (exactly the same goes for the movie's ending) but in a way that's so over the top you can't help but look at it with a big smile on out faces.And big smiles is what this film is after as much as contemplation. Fight Club is not some heavy study of today's society and it certainly doesn't provide all the answers to the questions it poses. It's a comedy and a smart one too, because it realises sometimes merely highlighting the questions is enough. Fight Club is not fascist, not hypocritical and not the answer (as another commenter already pointed out; if you liked it, you're probably part of the problem). Fight Club just is. Rating: (still) 10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Breaking the First Two Rules
",,"When I first saw Fight Club, it blew me away; I absolutely ate it up.  The film itself is superbly acted, well written (screenplay as well as original novel), and masterfully directed, with exceptionally skillful and subtle use of special effects.  One can really tell that this movie was a labor of love for everyone involved, from David Fincher to Rhett Wooden.*More than this, though, it was the message that got to me.  This movie in no small part led to a drastic shift in my personal outlook on life and my critical perspective.  I became highly sensitive to - and critical of - uncontrolled consumerism, individual insulation, and media manipulation, among other things.  I can honestly say that this movie helped change my life.After time and subsequent viewings, however, I have become more critical of Fight Club.  Isn't Tyler Durden - and thus, through his less-than-subtle preachiness, the movie itself - practicing the same force-feeding of ideology on Ed Norton's narrator and his ""space monkeys"" that he spends the whole movie railing against?  Isn't this movie, as a prepackaged, glitzy media spectacle, just another element of the mass media fixation and dependency that the narrator is trying to escape?  Other critics have said as much, and denounced the movie for hypocrisy and didacticism.However, one ought to consider the idea that the medium itself is always a part of the message.  The movie itself hints at this, as Brad Pitt's mischievous character (think Puck meets Travis Bickle) splices pornographic images into movies even as the viewer sees images of Brad spliced into Fight Club occasionally.  Think the irony of Hollywood Hunk Brad Pitt cast as the character who proclaims, ""We're all brought up to believe that we'll be movie gods and rock stars, but we won't,"" is accidental?If someone watches Fight Club and latches on to the message with intensity, like I did, then obviously that person needed to hear what Tyler Durden had to say, and had to hear it from Brad Pitt's famous & attractive mouth. Conversely, if someone watches Fight Club and is able to say ""that movie, while nicely executed, is overly preachy and hypocritical in its stated purpose,"" then that someone is independent enough of media not to need the media/cultural liberation that Fight Club preaches.That's what Fight Club's about, really - breaking free from cultural restraint of all kinds, even the restraints that allowed the genesis of that freedom.  It's about questioning everything - especially ads, magazines, TV, and - you guessed it - big-budget movies that tell you how to live your life.  So, while I've become more critical of Fight Club than I was originally, I only respect the movie that much more for its ability to subject itself to the same scrutiny it gives everything else.For these reasons and more, Fight Club is one of the best movies of the decade, and may well prove to be one of the defining movies of our generation, like The Graduate for the 60s and Saturday Night Fever for the 70s.I highly recommend consumption of Fight Club in any form, although this is one rare instance where I think film is the better-suited medium over print. I do have a beef with the movie's adaptation of the ending (considerably happier than the novel's), but that just enforces the idea that the movie itself isn't free from the trappings of Hollywood.The DVD is especially high-quality, with insightful commentary from the novelist, screenwriter, director, and main players (notably film buff Norton).9.5/10
*David Fincher is the director.  Rhett Woodon is the best boy grip.  In Fight Club, everyone has a name.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" The first rule is.WATCH THIS!!!
",,"A visually amazing update on the Jekyll and Hyde story, with a twist that will have you pressing rewind as soon as the closing credits start rolling (much in the same way as the Sixth Sense or Memento). Pitt, who, following Twelve monkeys and Se7en, is gradually endearing himself to me, gives a mesmerising performance as Tyler Durden, a dark, modern-day philosopher. Norton is even better as the monotone narrator, as is Bonham-Carter as Marla Singer, a FAAAR cry away from Merchant-Ivory; and Meatloaf is surprisingly good in a veeery bizarre role. Maybe it's the quick-fire editing, the incredibly dark humour (which is often very funny) or the dialogue that makes you think twice, but I just can't get enough of this movie. Forget any political, fascist or homosexual subtext, and accept this film for what it is: a unique blend of intelligence and entertainment. Mr Fincher, I salute you.However, when I watched this first of all in the cinema with a friend, she drew my attention to how violent it was; c'mon, I've seen a LOT worse. And hey, wouldn't we miss out on some great cinema if certain other movies that have 'inspired' infamous true-life acts of violence were never made: Taxi Driver, A Clockwork Orange, Reservoir Dogs etc. ? I rest my case.So, if you are squeamish, my advice is to find a friend who has already seen it to guide you through the violent parts, because if you are put off solely for that reason, then you would be missing a great movie. 9/10, deducting one for the utter confusion that reigned after I first saw it- repeat viewings clarify things!And ladies, for God's sake, don't just rent it out for 'Brad's abs', because there is a lot, lot more to this film than bloody well that!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Watch this movie more than once to fully understand it!
",,"""Fight Club"" became one of the weirdest movies back in 1999.  Starring Brad Pitt, Edward Norton, Helena Bonham Carter, Jared Leto, and Meat Loaf, and directed by David Fincher, didn't do to well by the critics, but, got mixed reviews by the audiences because of the story and the way it was made.  At first, I thought this movie would suck.  But, I checked it out and it was an OK movie.  But, I watched it more than once, the movie's in my list of all-time favorite movies.  It was a weird movie, but, it was well-made. David Fincher did a good job again with his camera work, the performances by the main and supporting actors were extraordinary, and the music (composed by The Dust Brothers) had a very good mix to it.  This movie was great.  If you like weird movies, then you'll enjoy ""Fight Club.""

" Most Folks Utterly Miss The Point (spoilers)
",spoiler,"I saw ""Fight Club"", and, mostly, I was bored.  The amazing thing about the movie isn't the movie itself but how the vast majority of people who see it -- especially men 16-40 -- see it through machismo-colored glasses and never really 'see' it.""Fight Club"" is not about consumerism or evil corporations or even about fighting.  It's about the dangers of homophobia, plain and simple, about being deep in the closet and being angry about it.As such, it's a hit-and-miss film, with good moments and bad.  One of its major drawbacks is a wildly inconsistent tone, a common problem with satire. But let's look at what so many viewers somehow miss.Start with the trail of bread crumbs that begins with Tyler Durden dressing like he shops for clothes in Ru Paul's trash.  Watch Jack hug a man with enormous breasts and no testicles and hear him say how it's oddly comforting.  Watch him and Tyler 'share' a woman who is, in fact, more masculine than either of them.Watch dozens of men join a secret, no-girls club (an underground social movement) in which they can't keep their shirts on or their hands off of each other.  Watch as this club turns into an adoring cult.  Watch as they scorn women -- especially women who use liposuction to 'artificially' try to be sexy and appealing to men.  Listen to all the dialogue complaining about emasculation, about how the world won't let you just be a man.Yes, very subtle.  The 'twist' at the end is like an exclamation point, and the falling phallic towers, and the gun-fellatio, and the unending symbolism of self-love / self-hate are a tad over the top.Why do these men fight each other?  Because they're too deep in the closet to express their feelings any other way.  Why do so many men who see this movie miss this searchlight glaring in their eyes?  You be the judge.The movie is clearly intentionally surreal, so why anyone would take it at face value is beyond me.  The fighting -- contrary to what many people absurdly claim -- is desperately unrealistic, no more realistic than the fighting in a typical 1970's kung fu film and less interesting to watch.  No one who's seen or been in a real fight -- that they were sober enough to remember clearly -- could say that the fighting in the movie is realistic. 
Nothing in the movie is realistic past the point where Jack meets Durden. The story is the fever-dream of a deeply conflicted man.  It's not even subtle about it.  The first act of the movie -- pre-Durden -- is all right, and pretty original, but once Durden shows up the film spirals down into drawn-out repetition and heavy-handed symbolism, becoming more and more hyperbolic and tiresome.I mean, OK, OK -- homophobia and repression are bad.  But the movie doesn't have much of a point if the audience leaves the theater without a clue.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Keep still while I punch you
",,"Words like over-rated and pseudo-intellectual come to mind when I look back on this film. Its overblown philosophising was lost on me long before it ended and I was not in the least surprised that its highest popularity in the IMDB ratings comes from males aged under 18. This demographic is of course renowned for its ability to look deeply into and appreciate the philosophical content of movies. This film seems to have developed a cult following but not, I suspect, for reasons its director intended.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" One of the best films of 1999.
",,"Edward Norton returns after his earth quaking performance in American History X to play the part of Jack (who has no last name for a reason), a typical white-collar guy who works in an office, makes a good salary, and spends his time trying to find that perfect furniture set or that set of the ideal matching dishes. He lives in an empty world defined by possessions and income  a world that is empty beyond his paycheck and his high rent apartment. He realizes this on a subconscious level and begins to have trouble sleeping, so eventually he goes out and joins support groups for afflictions that he doesn't have, just for the emotional release and the feeling of belonging and of meaning. He almost immediately finds relief to his sleeping problems (`Babies don't sleep this good.'), and makes the support groups a regular activity.  Unfortunately, one day he runs into someone else who is doing the same thing, Marla, and it ruins everything for him. This woman disgusts him (for obvious reasons), but he ultimately tries to reason with her so that they can both do the support group thing and not run into each other. The movie really starts moving when Jack runs into Tyler Durden while on a business trip. They meet on an airplane, and Jack is immediately impressed at what an interesting `single-serving' friend Tyler is. Tyler gives Jack his card, and Jack later calls him after his apartment explodes. Jack goes to stay with Tyler out of necessity, and Tyler introduces Jack to his world. Jack is fascinated. Tyler lives in a world devoid of personal possessions and responsibilities. He lives in a disgusting house, has no job (no steady one, anyway), pays no bills, and would more than likely be in trouble with the IRS if he were to be audited. He lives below the poverty line, obviously, but he is free, and Jack admires his ability to reject all forms of authority. Out of the blue one day, Tyler asks Jack to hit him, and after some convincing, they get into the fist fight that sets off the chain reaction which results in the formation of the tremendously popular Fight Club, Jack's most violent but most successful support group, a club that grows exponentially despite it's own first two rules. The goal of Fight Club is to get it's members to analyze their own lives and eliminate unnecessary garbage (`The advertising world has us working jobs we hate, so we can buy sh*t we don't need.') and to obtain psychological freedom through mutually agreed violence between members. Sure, this sounds a little weird, but there really is something to be said about the psychological states obtained from pain. To put it in the immortal words of Beavis & Butt-Head (just after Butt-Head has `smacked Beavis upside the head')  Butt-Head: `That was cool!' Beavis: `No it wasn't, that sucked!' Butt-Head: `Yeah but like, after it's over, doesn't it like, feel pretty cool?' Beavis: `Oh yeah, do that again!' This is not something that is likely to be practiced by everyday society, but a club like Fight Club would probably be successful on many levels (one of which, of course, would not be the legal level). There are a few things in the film that could have done with a little bit more explaining, like why Jack is so interested in fighting William Shatner, but it doesn't matter that this is not explained. Fight Club is one of those movies that not only invites, but also REQUIRES a second viewing, and for countless reasons.Fight Club asks audiences to re-evaluate their lives, noticing the superfluous quality of the material obsessions of modern society. It is one of the most cinematically unique films to be released in years, and easily earns it's place among the greatest films of 1999 (and possibly of the entire decade), alongside such other classics as The Matrix, The Sixth Sense, and American Beauty, although it has much more in common with the first two. There is an obvious correlation between Fight Club and director David Fincher's previous classic, Seven, which is another spectacular dark film from the same director. Fight Club is definitely aimed at a male audience, and it should actually be commended, in my opinion, for not sacrificing any quality just to attract a larger female audience, which is something that is almost universally seen in Jerry Bruckheimer productions like The Rock and Armageddon and Pearl Harbor. Fight Club does not pretend to be something it's not, and it comes off with tremendous success. I have heard professional film critics give Fight Club the lowest rating possible, foolishly focusing on the violent aspect of the film and entirely missing the point of the film as a whole while at the same time proving without a doubt that some critics simply cannot be trusted. Be advised that this is an almost stomach-turningly violent film at some points, but instead of condemning the film for that, it should be recognized for fitting that much violence into what is ultimately such a skilled and memorable film. It's too bad that films of this quality are so rarely seen in modern cinema.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" What's wrong?
",,"Why does everyone overrate Fight Club as IF it was a masterpiece?Why is Fight Club considered one of the all-time best? I don't know! Maybe this is me. I don't feel very attracted to movies with many violence, maybe I don't like to be confronted with the dark side of society nowadays (probably not the dark side, but 75% of society. I'm sorry, maybe, I didn't express myself well enough. I watched and enjoyed many movies with violence, but my  point is I don't like  (I'm sorry again) movies depicting very much misery. I believe that Fight Club couldn't have been shown otherwise. Anyway, I told you already that I didn't enjoy many with this odd picture, but as your mind and costumes may be somehow different, you may enjoy it and since this is made out of opinions you may rate this almost piece of crap however you want, but I can't give anymore than 4/10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Fight Club, a Powerful Satire on America's Unquenchable Desire for Materialism
",,"Is there any extent to which ordinary lives of annoyed individuals could be exciting? Fight Club is one of them. The movie is about Edward Norton, the narrator of the story and an insomniac who encounters a weird soap salesman named Tyler Durden to establish an underground fight club with some unorthodox strict rules. The partnership between the two characters works well unless Marla Singer, the leading female character, intervenes and grasps Tayler's attention.The critical tone of the movie against America's innate obsession with consumerism is certainly one of the strongest themes as it was the factor that helps audience to understand what the narrator and Tyler were fighting against. The narrator seems to be grasped in the system doing mindless purchasing of pieces of furniture. This is a widespread trap of materialism being promoted through advertisements. Buying useless stuff is the source of pleasure for people. The rich in the movie spend a fortune over trivial items like perfumes while the poor part of the society starved for basic needs. This thirst of consumers is unquenchable unless they control it on their own.The same theme is mingled up with the notion of perfection and beauty in things. The narrator acknowledges the fact that people like being healthy and are obsessed with things that are ""perfect."" The contemporary American society defines a perfect man to be the well-dressed one, owns many pieces of furniture and sustains a pleasant attitude all the time. The consumerism and this need of looking well-off are rooting in the same desire of appearing ""perfect."" The Narrator implicitly states that he was himself a ""product"" and he struggles to sell himself.None of the characters in the movie appears to be believing in God or any religion as those concepts are totally fragmented in contemporary American society where consumerism is the new ""religion"". This provides them a deeper and emotional satisfaction that one may find in prayers or submission of one's will to God.The theme is spiced up with the jaw-droppingly impressive performance of Edward Norton, the protagonist of the plot. He puts himself in shoes of a traditional common man doing his regular job. His attire and entire mise-en-scene of the movie speaks volumes for the distinction of Fight Club doing a great justification with the central theme. David Fincher used his camera and lighting for the character development of Tyler who is often shown in dark and stronger points of the frame. This makes him a strong character like lucifer stimulating Edward's ego. He is imaginary but his impact makes created through cinematography makes him more real than the Narrator himself. Fight Club stands out of the crowd among all the movies criticizing consumerism like American Psycho and The Wolf of Wall Street. This fact makes Fight Club a cult classic and one of the best movies ever made on the planet against the greedy nature of man.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" 2 Hours and 19 Minutes of MAGIC!
",,"The movie did not do well in the box office. I was gifted a copy of the film and I did not watch it for almost a year as I had not even heard about the name way back in 2003. Then I watched it one day. Then I watched it again the same day. And then I watched it multiple times thereafter. This is not a film, this is a gift for every movie lover.
I had not read the book and I have still not read the book. But if the book was half as good as the movie then the book should be one of the best sellers. This is a psychological thriller, the best yet. Carefully crafted by a superb David Fincher this is a film way way ahead of its time. The film captures your senses from the very beginning with a script that is second to none. Brilliant casting and extremely well acted by both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt and a solid performance by Helena B Carter.
This according to me is the best that Fincher has ever made, the kind of film that grows on you. The unique style of storytelling, the slight movement of the camera to capture every movement of the characters, brilliant use of the computer generated graphics, marvelous cinematography and editing, this movie is 2 hours and 19 minutes of magic.

" Fight Club is the stamp of anti-authority and the underground culture's identity
",,"Fight Club is perhaps David Fincher's most famous work. Why is it so popular? Of course the anarchist in your face plot and the anti-hero's cool demeanor make this a hugely popular film, especially among young disillusioned men. The film itself is brilliantly paced, reeking of humor and brilliantly shot. The acting is top notch. Ed Norton is relatable as the narrator and Brad Pitt shows why he was so popular back in the 90s- he owns the scenes. Ladies get a strong character in Helena Bonham Carter's Marla Singer, though quirky and psychotic. But then everyone is that way to some extent in this stylish film. One of Fincher's best and that's a tough call to make.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Better Than The Book
",,"I never thought I'd say that. Still, it's true. Chuck Palahniuk's novel is (understandably) a bit sloppy in places. Debuts often are. The pacing isn't great. That is, the ending's awkwardly abrupt and certain characters (notably Marla Singer) appear to quickly. Arguably, these little flaws help portray the Narrator's messy mind... though they still annoyed me greatly. The movie, on the other hand, corrects these mistakes. Marla is introduced after the Narrator has attended numerous (unneeded) support meetings. That dramatic, destructive finale feels more, well, final. It's beautiful, too - in a horrifying way. Some people complain about the bad/outdated CGI sequences. In my opinion, they add to the 'distant' feel. After many sleepless nights most things seem false... plastic. Computer generated. I would know, having suffered from insomnia for decades. Edward Norton's monotonous narration captures that stilted, strange state quite well. Anyway, overall, this movie's fantastic for a variety of reasons. Though I still think you ought to read the book first... just because...

" I really shouldn't talk about this!
",,"Some people say that this movie has no plot, but ignore them! Even Chuck Palahniuk agrees that it's better than his book.
In the year 2000 (I was pretty young back then), I received a video game magazine from a childhood friend. At the ""Movies'' section, I saw some reviews about Fight Club. That's the first time I heard about the movie; I didn't even bother reading about it (back then I wasn't into movies anyway). I remember that the name gave me a false impression of the movie; it sounded too catchy to be a good movie. I figured in my head a Van Damme or Steven Seagal brainless action movie or something and rejected the concept of Fight Club.
Many years from them, I totally ignored it, and even encouraged people not to watch it... until one day. It was a foggy and gloomy night and my father was watching the 8 o'clock PM every-saturday movie. At one point, I decided to watch the movie with him. Then, at one point in the movie, I found out I was actually watching Fight Club. I was stunned; that couldn't be the brainless action movie I pictured in my head all these years. I was so intrigued, I immediately watched it again, after a few days. I was even more stunned. Then, for the 3rd time - The movie was getting better and better. I was a fool for ignoring it...
I somehow consider this movie underrated, although it has a pretty solid fan base. The title deceived many of us; I thought I was one of the few people deceived by the title... I was wrong again. After becoming a fan, I started spreading the good news about the movie. Many had reactions like ""Dude, I DON'T watch those kind of movies"" or ""Come on, you cannot like those type of movies!"" or ""Ehhh, I hate stupid fighting movies"". I tried in vain to open their eyes but their answers were even more frustrating: ""I know it could be entertaining, but I don't like simple movies"".
I believe that even today, there are people that consider this movie a typical cliche action movie. Something must be done... or not.
Every time I watch this movie, i discover something new. Of course I don't want to talk about this movie and reveal spoilers, but I must say that there are also some subliminal messages (especially at the beginning, before the narrator meets Tyler Durden).
This movie is pretty much perfect to me, and it's also a nostalgia-inducing factor.
Now, I must pay for the fact that I mentioned the name ""Fight Club"". We all know what I'm about to lose...",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Relevant upon release, relevant today
",,"When a depressed, restless man (Edward Norton) looking for a solution to his problems meets a soap salesman named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), the two join up to form an underground Fight Club. Along the way, they meet and recruit other men in the same boat, all looking for an escape from their mundane lives. Together, they set out to accomplish much more than just your ""ordinary"" underground fighting ring.We initially meet the narrator as he describes his life with a less than enthusiastic attitude. He monotonously describes his apartment and contents as the things he was taught by society to want. With every purchase, he is seemingly filling a void that continues to grow with each purchase and is never able to be satisfied. After meeting Tyler Durden, the narrator begins to question whether or not he has to accept what he has been taught as fact, or whether he is willing and able make a change. After a significant event forces the narrator to vacate his IKEA catalog-filled apartment, the narrator decides to take Durden up on his offer as a way out of his excruciatingly boring life. As we follow the narrator and Durden through uninviting environments beginning with his apartment and transitioning to dilapidated houses and after-hours bar basement brawls, we see a reflection of the narrator's internal mood in each place. All of the men the narrator and Durden recruit along the way have fallen victim to becoming worker drones and feel as though their lives have no purpose, just like the main character. They are living as they have been told to live, buying what they've been told to buy, and unconsciously adapting to ideals in which they themselves do not believe. Eventually, the fight club develops its own set of laws and ideals far from those of modern society. The men feel they have purpose and as such, come up with a plan to change the world and their own lives forever.Fight Club emphasizes the modern American consumeristic culture and the feeling of feminism it forces on men. As a result, men like the narrator are forced to suppress their natural masculine tendencies in lieu of adapting to the mainstream way of living. When these feelings are repressed for a length of time, males become depressed and search for the remedy. The fighting, although a turn-off for some viewers, is a necessary component of the film as the men in the club attempt to regain some semblance of the manhood run off by our culture.The cinematic elements of this film are top-notch in creating an environment that is as grim and depressing as the thoughts inside the narrator's mind. The production staff make excellent use of lighting and camera lenses to create dimly lit rooms, camera angles that make the audience feel though they are part of the club, and sound that transfers the pain of the fight right to the viewer. In fact, in a particular scene which utilizes some forbidden materials to create bars of soap, we can almost smell the horrific aroma created in the room through the extensive audio and visual elements used. While mainstream culture dictates much of our lives even today, 20 years after production, the narrator and his club allow the viewer to decide whether the consequences are worse to follow the herd of consumerism or to make our own statement of masculinity and create a little mayhem.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A sardonic satire that gets under your skin and works on multiple viewings.
",,"To say this is a film solely about grown men punching one another is like saying 'Dances With Wolves' is about a bloke and his pet trying to win a weird cross-breed calypso competition, for the flick is actually a satire centred on our consumerism and commercialism consumed society with a successfully sardonic tone and a keen set of delightfully devious twists and turns, the least of which being its focal reveal which is one of the most lauded and documented twists in cinematic history but is also vastly overrated in terms of why 'Fight Club (1999)' is so successful despite it being a truly clever and revolutionary reveal. It's the taut pacing and screw-tightening screenplay that ratchets up both the tension and confusion, the perfect performances that sell the sometimes silly seeming goings-on and the perfectionist grimy direction that points the viewer in one direction while doing something vastly important in the other that all add up to make the experience a lasting and memorable one that feels as though it has something to say, gets under your skin and works on multiple viewings to equally successful effect. 8/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Fight club is an excellent movie that must be seen.
",,"Fight Club was one of those movies from the 90's that was going to polarize people because of its subject matter. Some critics thought of Fight Club as an exercise in sadomasochism while others thought it was a biting social satire. I would argue with the latter, but the truth is Fight Club is a cautionary tale against the dangers of nihilism. The film starts with Jack a white collar worker, who suffers from extreme bouts of insomnia. However, insomnia is the least of Jack's problems Jack has become dissatisfied with his life. He has become numb to the banality of his everyday life. His life has become a series of routines that is one step away from turning him into a drone. So in order to alleviate his existential crisis, Jack goes to support groups so he can feel better about himself. Most of these support groups are dedicated to people who have terminal cancer, so in essence, Jack latches onto these people to remind himself that he's more fortunate than them. But he doesn't do this out of pity he does this to give his life meaning. Alas, Jack's sanctuary is shattered when a sardonic Goth named Marla enters the picture. Jack has seen Marla in various support groups and he knows that she's a faker just like him. However, unlike Jack Marla goes to these support groups as a voyeur. Jack threatens to expose her but she retaliates by threatening to expose him. So they come to an agreement of sorts, they agree to share certain days for the support groups. Weeks later, Jack meets Tyler Durden on an airline Durden is everything Jack is not. Durden is charismatic, confident, crass and strangely funny. Durden informs Jack that he's a soap salesman. The two engage in idle chat, but it's clear from the get go that these two have a lot in common. Later that night, Jack has what could only be described as the worse night of his life, his condo explodes and to make matters worse the police suspect him. Inevitably, Jack calls Tyler and the two agree to meet at a local bar. Durden gives Jack a monologue about his philosophy on life and the two hit it off becoming fast friends. Durden persuades Jack to stay with him at his dilapidated house and Jack agrees. As a favor, Jack agrees to hit Tyler and the two engage in a street fight. This is the moment where the film really takes it stride, as Tyler and Jack engage in various street brawls other people take their lead and soon word spreads around about these street brawls. Tyler and Jack create a club called Fight Club, an underground fighting club where people can fight with complete strangers. As the film progresses, it becomes apparent that these people that join Fight Club are lost souls and misfits of society. Most of these men have become broken and emasculated, from working at jobs they don't like to buy stuff they don't need as Tyler surmises. In essence, Fight Club becomes their sacrament, their key to enlightenment. The film grows murkier as Marla starts to engage in a liaison with Tyler and Jack begins to have doubts about Fight Club. To divulge any more would simply spoil the surprises that happen later in the film. But I will say this, what transpires in the third act of Fight Club is both perplexing and prophetic in this post 9/11 world we live in today. Many people have complained that Fight Club tonally is inconsistent, but this is not the case Fight Club is a dark comedy from start to finish. There are scenes of utter hilarity in Fight Club, like the scene where Tyler and Jack steal fat from a liposuction clinic to make soap or the scene where Jack beats himself up to blackmail his boss. These scenes may offend some, but for those select few that appreciate this type of dark humor, they will really get a real kick out of these scenes. Over the past decade, Fight Club has developed a cult following of sorts and it's not hard to see why. Fight Club is a biting social satire about the superficiality of American culture and the absurdity of the materialism that is embedded in our culture. It also serves as a cautionary tale about the dangers of going beyond social constraints and dedicating your life to philosophies that are primal, bestial and potentially dangerous.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" It's not what it seems
",spoiler,"Fight Club is one of those rare films that come along once in a blue moon, a film that challenges the very limits of your mind and hits all the correct notes in doing so. Brad Pitt gives the performance of a lifetime playing Tyler Durden, but all is not as it seems. The nameless narrator of Fight Club played by Edward Norton asks more questions than it cares to answer, but wait for it, your answer will come in due course, and while you're waiting for this revelation to arrive, you'll be gripped by a stylish, well crafted piece of film-making that will keep you hooked throughout. Tyler Durden is the kind of man you dream about, but never ever want to be , a dirty, downright detestable human being who has no morals and carries with him an irresistible thirst for self destruction.How much can you know about yourself if you've never been in a fight?A fair question that Tyler soon sets out to answer, weaving his way through society picking out the lowest of the low and those with an appetite for destruction, forming the secret Fight Club.First rule of Fight Club, don't talk about Fight Club!Inevitably the thirst to fight, reverting back to our primitive instincts, wasn't enough for Tyler, and he and his assembled group of disciples set out onto a wave of crime to try and scratch the ever growing itch. There was a difficult to get your head round, on-off romance involving Tyler and the narrator with Marla Singer, a mentally unstable woman whom the narrator met at a self help group that the both of them attended. This three way romance tied into the film's twist, but I'm not going to spoil it for you.On a side note, I thought Brad Pitt's ""soap making scheme"" was pretty cool albeit grotesque, one particular scene that stands out for me was when Tyler and the narrator went to the dumpster at the back of the doctors to fish out some ""ingredients"" for Tyler's soap venture, nice!A tasteless work of cinematic art, a new and inventive way of telling a story painted onto the silver screen. It was so good because it dared to be different and boy did it pay off, plus the overall acting quality was superb, the story was superb and the film's legendary twist pushed it onto a whole new level that was previously uncharted.One of the top film's of all time, if you haven't seen it then why not, essential viewing for any budding film fan.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

His friend became his father figure and now Tyler is Jacks foe When Marla comes by Jack breaks his promise to Tyler, and mentions him to Marla who understandably is confused by the notion that Tylers not here Tyler went away Tyler's gone Its the very first time in the movie that Jack has been vulnerable around her instead of rudely pushing her away",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" That mind game...
",spoiler,"I think that one of the most amazing things about this movie is that the movie itself is just as same as his main character. Messed out.I have to be honest, at one point in time, i did not have any idea what to think of this whole plot. I was just like ""lets see what happens at the end"". I didn't know on which side is the truth. And I loved it. That whole confusion that is lived by Lou is transferred to watchers and i consider that among the best qualities of this film. A story that is told is what we feel and it is hard to describe it. It is something you have to experience.I like that revolutionary spirit, that rebel prism we all look through on this movie and that state of mind which is totally broken and that made me think about what is my purpose in this world, in my life, in whole this universe. That freedom of doing a scene that co respond with Lou's (or Tyler's, I still don't know what to think) mental disease and having that true feeling that entire movie is just a picture he sees. I say again, it is so hard to describe.One thing I didn't like, one among the very few, is braking of the barrier between the movie and watchers. Concept was endangered and that, beside some small but pretty lame mistakes like some total coincidences, made me give it 9 instead of 10.A great psychological game with a watcher's mind, well set and done movie plot, great story of a man's mental rise and fall, unusual love story, rebel awakening in viewers, outstanding acting, unexpected twist... This movie has it all.

No movie is perfect after all.There are some types of movies that are especially rare. Movies with huge twists and surprises that are actually well done and make freaking sense after a little reflection. Fight Club possibly has one of the biggest, and most amazingly executed, twists of all time. The Sixth Sense had an amazing twist as well, but it was much easier to see coming. I actually suspected that something was amiss long before it happened and by the reveal I knew it was coming (though I might not have if not for one brief shiver). But this movie actually got me! That is so rare that it deserved the extra star for that alone.That aside this movie is fantastic and is a true gem of a movie. It's not for everyone, and parents should certainly watch it and consider carefully before letting their children watch it, but it is as deserving of a ten as any movie I've ever seen.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced. I should see this movie. I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD.

" This is a masterpiece. Plain and simple; Would Recommend
",spoiler,"​Plot Overview: After his apartment blows up, The Narrator(Edward Norton) seeks the help of a friend he met on an Airline, Tyler Durden(Brad Pitt). Together, the two men form an underground boxing ring called 'Fight Club' but soon things begin spiralling out of control.Directed by David FincherStarring Edward Norton, Brad Pitt and Helena Bonham Carter# NO SPOILERS!Overall: This movie is, simply put, a masterpiece. I cannot name a meaningful flaw with the film. Acting, story, cinematography - everything; it was perfect. Masterful direction and Oscar worthy performances intertwine together to create a pretty much flawless movie and stands as one of the greatest movies of all time!The type of people who will like this movie will be fans of interesting and intricate stories.Would Highly Recommend.# POSSIBLE SPOILERS!Edwards Norton was amazing as The Narrator. Brad Pitt delivers an Oscar calibre performance as Tyler Durden as this may be one of my favourite performances from him. The way both characters are written is so perfect because they are so different yet so alike. Helena Bonham Carter was great as the troubled Marla Singer. Despite having more minor roles, both Jared Leto and Meatloaf do good as Angel Face and Bob respectivelyThe story was brilliant and genius. The revelation at the end of this movie was pure genius and will 100% go down in cinema history as one of the greatest of all time. Such smart and brilliant storytelling leading to a perfect end. This movie's story is its best strength and is masterfully crafted.The cinematography was great in this movie.The effects were nice. The set design was great and the costume design was amazing, especially for Tyler Durden. The one thing this movie needed to do was provide a decent story. It does that and also provides brilliant characters, a brilliant ending and puts you on a non-stop ride from beginning to end.The grand revelation at the end, while brilliant, does make some previous events feel a little weird and can be a bit dodgy.Personally, I loved every single second of this movie and just from one watch it has breached at least my top 20 films of all time.10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I loved the surprise ending
",,"Don't worry, I'm not going to spoil the ending but I will say it will shock you. When I saw this movie in theaters I had to watch over and over again to catch everything. Trust me, it was worth the money. Brad Pitt is my favorite part of this movie and the supporting cast is good too. I guess you can say that my least favorite actor was the female or some would call it the love interest. I thought that the movie could do better with either another actress playing that role or just eliminating it all together. I saw it at the movies and now I have the DVD. This movie is funny, full of actions and suspense. You gotta see it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Good film.
",spoiler,"The unnamed narrator (Edward Norton) is a traveling automobile recall specialist who suffers from insomnia. One night, he visits a support group for testicular cancer victims, where they assume that he, too, is a victim, and he spontaneously weeps into the nurturing arms of another man, finding a ""freedom"" that euphorically relieves his insomnia. He becomes addicted to participating in support groups of various kinds, always allowing the groups to assume that he suffers what they do. However, he begins to notice another impostor, Marla Singer (Helena Bonham Carter), whose presence disturbs his bliss. The two negotiate to avoid their attending the same groups, but, before going their separate ways, Marla gives the narrator her phone number. On a flight home from a business trip, the narrator meets Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a soap salesman with whom he begins to converse after noticing the two share the same kind of briefcase. After the flight, the narrator returns home to find that his apartment has been demolished by an explosion. He calls Tyler and they meet at a bar. A conversation about consumerism leads to the narrator moving into Tyler's dilapidated mansion. Outside the bar, Tyler requests that the narrator hit him, which leads the two to engage in a fistfight. They have further fights outside the bar on subsequent nights, and these fights attract growing crowds of men. The fighting eventually moves to the bar's basement where the men form a ""fight club,"" a routine opportunity for the men to fight recreationally.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Misconception Analysis
",,"While universally praised by all types of people, teenage and young adult audience members in specific tend to gravitate towards Fight Club, hailing it as one of the greatest films of all time and currently placing it at #10. on IMDb's Top 250 films. However, there are plenty of people that deem this film overrated, and while I can't quite agree with that, I would say, much like Pulp Fiction, people tend to consciously praise this film for the wrong reasons and through superficial means. For the fairly shallow reasons people claim to like this film, I would say in that sense, it is overrated. I would argue that this film is quite misinterpreted by common audience members and even by well-known film critics. Edward Norton's narrator character is not named, to serve as a vehicle for the audience to adopt themselves upon. He is a regular American white collar Caucasian male in his thirties. He is a regular person. He is a loser to many as his life is empty. In essence, he is the audience. Tyler Durden represents the other extreme, while being a different side of the same coin. Audiences generally love Tyler Durden, and it makes sense that they do in a way, as he embodies everything they wish to be or wish to have. Tyler Durden is the ideal masculine role, but the Narrator is given the task to redefine that role. Tyler Durden influences the Narrator to give up his dependent and materialistic lifestyle and embrace life for what it is; in essence all that matters is up to the individual. I think the film is also about finding a balance and not going too far in a way. The film is about how people should strive to improve, accept their worth, or lack of, but not give in so far that they lose sense of their individuality.There's an over growing sense that one should not give in too much. The fight clubs and Project Mayhem begin to form a cult with set rules and priorities, embracing a mindless sheep like organized role, which is what they are set out to go against. They ultimately and ironically are fighting against what they are, which gives more insight and meaning to the film's twist. The twist is what audiences tend to focus on, while thinking the film is actually endorsing what the fight clubs and Project Mayhem stand for. The answer is neither 'no' nor 'yes' but rather 'sort of'. As mentioned before, the film argues for balance. The narrator, while ultimately agreeing with Tyler in some ways, feels things are getting out of hand, especially after a man is killed. Once he kills off Tyler, he is then ridding himself of the extremist side of him in a way, though not fully as he is still adopting some of that side. Tyler taught him not to need consumerist products and lifestyle, but he went too far and the narrator realizes he does not need Tyler. The film is about gaining a little bit of both sides. Tyler is not the hero. He is going too far and the audience needs to catch onto the fact that he is not the ideal one should strive for, but rather strive for that of the protagonist at the end. One should be their own individual but strive to improve and not give in and embrace extremes. The film is first about ridding one's self of the materialistic means and ideals society sets forth, including hyper-masculine extremist role models that Tyler embodies. The film is being more like the narrator than Tyler. Despite this, audience members lose sight of this and still view the film of being film as being for Tyler's philosophy and character ideal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" College-Aged Males: This is your anthem
",,"For a child of the 80s, this was perfect...the antidote to feeling hemmed in and impotent. i'd imagine this movie is less appealing to today's college-aged boys, but maybe i'm wrong... i hope that masculine-ideal-related anxiety is becoming less pervasive... although the internet may prove otherwise. this film features a stellar soundtrack by the Dust Brothers, high replay-ability (thanks to lots of little Easter eggs) and a pretty dynamic cast...

" mind-blowing...literally
",spoiler,"In terms of uniqueness, Fight Club stands alone in its own perfectly crafted category. The cinematography of rapid and slowed down scenes of large and small scale gives this film a distinguishable edge over all other films. Finchers use of slow-motion fits into each and every sequence and the distribution of the blood adds a certain realistic feature. Of course, since this film is highly acclaimed and frequently talked about, its hard not to hear rumors and gossip about the plot. However, I deliberately stayed away from this film until I was able to sit down and see it and my motives didn't disappoint. The plot twist hit me hard and had me skimming earlier parts of the film to test its consistency. It is one of the best plot twists of all time, other than the 6th sense, and will continue to keep this movie amongst the greats.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Quick Summary
",,"By far one of the best movies I have ever seen. With all the talent of Brad Pitt and geniality of David Fincher. The plot is well designed and there is nothing for free, everything makes sense. Of course we can not forget, that this movie cames from a book, but people often forget about this and don't give the prestige that writer deserves.But of course there are some differences between the movie and the book, so I recommende bothMy vote is 8 out of 10, no because there is something wrong with the movie, but until I've never watched a movie the deserves 10. Of Course, it's just my opinion",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club Movie vs. Book
",,"I Love the Movie, but that being said the book is better. This is true for most book to films. I think the only reason I loved the movie was getting in the mind frame of putting it as a separate entity from Chuck Palahniuk's novel. In comparison Brad Pitt definitely took the character and ran with it making it his own. If you have not read the book I highly recommend it. I recommend anything from Chuck Palahniuk! Fight Club (the movie) is one of my all time favorites and has become a cult classic. The following and the message are edgy and fun. Helena Bonham Carter and Edward Norton are incredible together and the fight scenes are satisfying. The only thing I wish there was more of, was details with the actual missions of project mayhem. I also would have liked a little more of the psyche of Tyler Durden. Great Character development and twists. The plot was outstanding. Palahniuk's brain is a dirty masterpiece!!!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club Movie Review-Spoiler Alert
",spoiler,"****SPOILER ALERT************I give this movie 8.5/10 as it is very entertaining, captivating, seductive, and at times makes you readjust your sitting position and ask yourself what in the world is going on. This movie was brilliant in several aspects. I feel like it encapsulated several themes, and the top ones addressing mental health issues, as well as the consumer culture that we live in. Fight Club has big time actor Brad Pitt playing Tyler Durden, who is the main character's alter ego. Marla Singer is played by Helena Bonham Carter and is the narrator's ""girlfriend"" throughout the movie. Edward Norton plays the main character to in which is officially referred to as the unnamed narrator. This is a bold, yet unique approach from director David Fincher which almost compliments the character. The movie begins with the narrator struggling with insomnia and slowly divulges into his private life and many personal issues. The narrator appears to have some underlying issue or set of problems that is inhibiting him from acquiring hardly any sleep whatsoever. Deciding on this name for the character compliments his character in the fact that he appears to have a lack of confidence or the ability to address any of his issues, letting them perpetually compound into a greater mess. This mess is later revealed as Schizophrenia, which contrary to popular belief does not have multiple personalities, as well as Identity Disorder, which is indeed the root cause of multiple personality disorder. The narrator begins to attend a testicular cancer support group to personally feel real pain. He endures raw emotion and cries with a member there, coincidentally allowing him to begin sleeping. He meets Tyler Durden on a flight for a business trip, and escalates his testicular cancer meetings into what we all know as Fight Club.I feel one of the underlying issues from the narrator, as well as everyone that eventually attends Fight Club, is an issue with the consumer culture we live in. We live in such a materialistic world that when we're unhappy, we go out and buy ice cream or a pair of shoes. Instead of addressing the fact that we're depressed from being overweight, lack of exercise to stimulate endorphins, release dopamine, or maintain our serotonin levels. All being things we could personally control, yet everyone just continues to overeat in place of these things.We first take notice of this in the film when his apartment burns down, and he loses his suitcase filled with all of his things. To him this was his identity and creates an internal combustion within him. He evolves Fight Club into Project Mayhem with the realization that if you want anything in this world, including happiness, you have to go out and take it. He ends the movie by shooting himself in the head which the bullet exited his cheat allowing him to live, yet frees him of his alter ego when he dies, as they are the same person.This film was the first thing since Clockwork Orange to boldly portray mental health as an epidemic issue. People are so easily recruited for fight club, due to their own underlying mental health issues regardless of what they are. The narrator dealing with a range from depression, insomnia, clear to schizophrenia.The lighting in the entire film is very dark, which helps compliment the depressing nature of the character, and helps shine light on Tyler Durden. The camera angles have the narrator and Tyler Durden appear to be in important places in the group, almost allowing you to see their power. Angles are also shot as a close up full frontal from the main characters, and more of a distant panning for everyone else, establishing them as the main characters.Fight Club was well worth my time and money to watch it. If you didn't enjoy it's violent seductive nature, then perhaps you can enjoy the depth of the film that definitely helps shine light on our mental health issues being nurtured by materialistic things and ideas. This is a movie I would definitely watch again.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight club is not a movie.
",spoiler,"By the time the movie ended merely one phrase intruded my mind and that was that fight club is more of a documentary rather than a film. Now this statement might seem a bit blunt and technically flawed but I tell you once it ended I did not bother to evaluate Norton's or Pit's performances, nor did I make a comment about the direction(which was spectacular and a breakthrough for its time). This film summarizes the condition of our world, of our society which is gradually sinking into more and more consumerist ideas and models. It indicates the intolerable routine in the working environment; people who have no dreams or ideals,who are programmed to work, eat, sleep (I wouldn't say so) and repeat. Norton is the typical worker in our society, characterized by a complete lack of energy and depression, having no goals or whatsoever. He is asleep when he is awake and awake when being asleep. He needs to cry, to feel and love and be human( that is the point where these church meetings come in). Norton searches for his actual self. I merely had one question after the movie's end and sorry guys I had no intention of categorizing this review as a spoil but I need to ask: in the end where Norton says his final lines and where the mind-blowing pixies song comes in, what does he intend to do? Who is he deep inside after all? Is he still one of the ""programmed"", consumerist piles of meat in our society or is he Pit?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A Great, Exceptional Masterpiece from David Fincher
",spoiler,"Think about it. The movie has something so special that it does seem interesting to critics and the viewers. All the characters have put maximum effort to make the movie a great success. It may have a dark theme, but a dark theme with exceptional perfection. The movie really has an interesting twist.At First I didn't know who David Fincher was. As a matter of fact I thought he'd be some normal director with small-scale movies. Then I thought about watching the movie. I wasn't very interested of watching it. But I gotta say I was really really blown away.I recommend every guys who prefer dark sci-fi to watch this movie WITH interest.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Gives Way More Than a Single-Use or Single=Serving
",,"I totally #Loved# this movie from beginning, ALL the way up until it's unforeseen - & twisty end - An instant classic. So much so, it has been inducted onto very, short list of mine. Short, only because it is rarest of films. The kind that I don't mind watching over and over. (Why waste such precious time, when I have so many other films I want to watch/discover?)I should also mention a totally unabashed guilty pleasure of mine that happens only with this film. I admit. I am utterly compelled to hit *pause* so that I may take in one of the most captivating, memorable images of Brad Pitt's ethereal beauty.I most certainly should make note of one more thing before I wrap up my ramble. #Applause To Whomever performed the casting for this wonderful gem, as well. Not just only because one of my favourite actresses, Helena Bonham Carter, was cast as the films lead protagonist. A role to which Helena obviously totally immersed herself into it's character. Especially since she almost became unrecognizable to me, in a good way, I second guessed myself throughout the movie. Only at the end of the film, during the scroll of the credits, was I made totally certain that it was indeed Helena. Meatloaf also is worth mentioning, for the role of 'Bob', needs giant kudos as well. Meatloaf is captivating in his performance of the most tortured of characters named 'Bob' which is brilliant and totally unforgettable. And of course, this movie is where I was properly introduced to Ed Norton, as an actor. Thank you Fight Club.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" This is not any beautifully written, grammatically accurate review
",,"but the same worthless piece of writing written by a person's organ just as everybody's else. The movie revolves around a man 'The Narrator' (Edward Norton) who is bored from his life joins a group where people share their feelings, there he meets an annoying girl who plays an important role in the movie named Marla Singer, then he meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), initiates a group named Fight Club where people fight with each other and commit crimes in the city. It changes his life but he gets embroiled in relationship with him. The movie is divided into 2 halves. One that develops the character of 'The Narrator' throwing light on his boring (for him) yet interesting and relatable life (for us). The other part of the movie is psychologically thrilling. The 'thrilling' part of the movie is insanely effective. It can change one's perspective towards life for an hour at least, although that is very short period of time but you would see the world from a much better perspective. In that part of the movie, 'The Narrator' fights with his own philosophy to make the moral choice (stop the chaos in the city). The characters are one the coolest characters of all time. They are inspiring, cool and relatable especially Tyler Durden. The Narrator is an antisocial insomniac, critical thinker. He pays attention to almost everything surrounding him. He uses scientific terms and complex words while framing sentences so as to appear clever. He is bored from repeating his everyday life. He lacks friends and family. The 1st part of the movie is great because it's interesting, it's relatable and the narrator narrates it in his lovely emotionless voice, with humour and sarcasm at times. Tyler Durden is also an anti socialist who have radical methods to spread his philosophy i.e renunciation of modern society, facing pain and death as major part of the life. He hates the fact that people are bound with the laws of sociality & government and cannot do their will. He is like a teacher. He wants people to do what they want to. He does not like all those boring stuffs people do such as watching flashes of pictures bring projected on T.V. You must have got the idea. He initiates Fight Club where people fight to experience physical pain, not to win so as to get people out of stupid socialism. The ideas of spreading ideas through violence may sound idiotic but is beyond awesomeness because it is only when you are tortured that you would reveal your true reaction to something. You wouldn't be afraid to do anything. You wouldn't be shy to remove your pants and when you will adapt to pain, there would be nothing in the world that could frighten you. Tyler Durden is not afraid of anything, he cannot be tortured. That's what Tyler Durden makes of The Narrator. He makes him beat himself ruthlessly without the fear of pain. Both are each other's best friends. Tyler Durden does a lot of things to make the narrator what he wants him to become. He successfully does it to the members of Fight Club but it was quite a challenge for The Narrator. That part of the movie begins when 2nd half starts. The 2nd half of the movie is psychologically thrilling. Although it is one of the best psychological thrillers but since the 1st half of the movie was completely drama, it is not considered a thriller film by IMDb or Google. The scenes of the 2nd half are quite intense, insane, inspiring and disturbing. The background soundtrack played during those scenes are mysterious, noisy representing chaos and confusion. That's why it received Oscar nominations for that category. Sometimes , there is no background soundtrack at all, it's just the solid acting and intense emotions that dominate those scenes. The Narrator, then begins narrating with confusion with all the chaos going on. There's always a psychological atmosphere maintained in that half. It have aspects of neo-noir movies but is not actually one of them.Then comes the plot-twist. If you have googled Fight Club you must be familiar that it is also known for its mind blowing plot twist. Unlike other movies, this one continues even after the plot twist and The Narrator becomes more connected to the audience and the movie becomes even more mind-fuzzing. It's like The Sixth Sense running even after the plot twist. There are tons of hint. In fact the whole movie is the hint. You would never be able to spot all the hints or predict the plot twist. After typing ""hints for Fight Club's plot twist"" (don't do that if you haven't seen it) you would realize that this is one of the most clever movies ever made. Marla Singer is the girl in Fight Club. Although, she may not seem important but she plays a very important role in the movie. It is difficult to understand her, from that statement I am not referring to what people say for girls nowadays, Marla Singer is just weird. She is not afraid of death, she is also anti social and talks weird things. The plot twist could have been even more mind blowing if it included her. Fight Club is actually a moral movie in its own dark way. Dark morality is a much better term for example Joker's quote (The Dark Knight). Some people didn't liked the movie. Some people hated the very idea of the movie, that's the reason why Academy Awards didn't liked it. However David Fincher will never be able to make a better movie, neither will Church Palahniuk ever write a better novel. They both made a masterpiece. Directing skills, screenplay, writing and acting is great too. ^- I am Jack's honest review.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" One guy is two guys

It got me good and in the end I was very stunned that one plot twist, everyone knows by now, took place. Everyone who hasn't seen it, should. It's a really great classic movie. Part of history, ma man. Who has already seen it, knows already and this review is unnecessary. Hope this was all helpful and such ;-) So, IMDb wants me to make this review longer than necessary. I can do that. It is a move that speaks to all who live their life as not to the fullest. Keep all reservations up and go the easy and save way. Life is not about the save road. It's comfortable, but once you ask yourself what you do, you want answers you don't have. Actually Fight Club might help inspire getting out of the comfy zone. Not to fight others.

I still do and I am always happy to watch it again or recommend to my friends. Edward Norton as the main character is a normal guy with a normal job, but he lives very normal life - boring, without any adventure. He'll meet that guy Tyler (Brad Pitt) and everything will change.

I'm not gonna give any spoilers in order to not ruin the experience for those who still haven't watched but I probably can say that it contains a twisted plot and some mind-blowing scenes that you'll need to watch the entire movie more than once in order to understand the whole story as it is... I've watched five or six times and every single time I get a new concept of the movie! Funny thing is that after you watch you start thinking if that can really happen to someone. Also, I love the theories of all multiple personalities, it even looks like a totally different movie depends on what you believe. There's only one bad thing about it: don't expect an end that explains everything on black n' white cause it won't happen..

You'll scour the web looking for top ten lists of movies like Fight Club, and there is virtually none. You'll watch this movie, and come out with a strong taste for more. But there's none to be had.

" The movie was about a person who can be anybody describes how he could not sleep and that everything around him lacked meaning.
",spoiler,"This review has spoilers* Movie summary and comments. This movie was based on 4 character: The main character (narrator) – Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt) – and bob (Meat loaf) and Marla Singer (Helena Bonham). There was no development on Helena Bonham (Marla Singer); we just know that she believed that anyone can die at any time; Meat loaf (Bob) a depress person who had his testicles removed. Then different shots were made just to develop brad Pitt (Tyler Durden) character. He was described as a movie editor, a restaurant waiter and a soap salesman.The movie was about a person who can be anybody describes how he could not sleep and that everything around him lacked meaning. He meets Tyler on a flight and after having his apartment caught on fire, he asked Tyler if he could go live with him. Then he and Tyler started a fist fight outside a bar which then it became something they would do more often. People around them asked to be part of the fights; therefore, the fight club was form. The club main rules was ""you do not talk about fight club."" Then the main character describes how fighting gave him an escape from his reality. The reality he describe was based on his boring routine. At some point of the movie, Tyler started to recruit people to start a something called project mayhem. The main character did not know the meaning of project mayhem. The project was based like fight club; you were no allow to ask questions. When the main character confronted Tyler, he was asked to let go of reality and to stop trying to control it. When the main character try to find Tyler, he realized how big fight club became; however, he did not know how. Finally, a person called him Tyler and he realized that he has been Tyler all along. Every decision made or action taken by the member of the fight club was done by the main character. He realized that he created a personality called Tyler to escape from his routine. Project mayhem was based on caused. Blowing up the buildings were the credit cards information were storage. In the end all those building were blow up and the main character shot himself to get rid of Tyler. In my opinion, you don't really know which personality of the main character survived at the end of the movie. In this movie, The narrative sound effects make the viewer more engage on the things happening to the character. At this points we can only guess he is the main character of the film. A named is not given for the main character of the movie, but we know he is the narrator (Edward Norton). I have watched this movie before but I did not notice that a named was not given to the narrator character. Edward character can be anybody who is simple bored of his everyday activities. The narration would also describe the characters feelings. It even describe the place and environment where they lived. I mentioned that you could hear the world around Edward to be loud but in one scene, he narrated ""everything around him got quiet"" after every fight. The establishment of the fight club was to escape from reality. There were close up of people work uniform, people with ties, engagement rings. It displayed that anybody could be at the fight club. The sound effect during the fight were done well. You could hear every punch taken or given as well as the noise of people cheering in the background. Even when the narrator would start talking, you could still hear noise around him.After the fight club, the recruitment started. People were found and train like military. Then the project mayhem was created with member of the fight club. Same as fight club, you were not allow to ask questions. People in project mayhem did not have a named which means anybody could be part of the project. Only after death, you were allow to be recognized. When the narrator realized he was Tyler, everything came to him really fast. Fast shots of the past shows the things he did. The sounds was loud and low depending on the character feelings. He realized that his insomnia became his other personality (Tyler). The movie was done really well. The viewer did not realized that Tyler was not real until the end of the movie. The movie was a representation what happens when we don't accept the reality around us. It describe our breaking point and how our routine can ruined us. At the end Edward said ""I have my eyes open now"" which means he won't escape from reality anymore or it could mean that he won't ignore his reality anymore. Even if I know the end of the movie, I wanted to see if I could found a point of the movie were the main character should have realized that Tyler did not exist.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" good
",,"When I first saw the previews for this movie, it had me interested. A movie about guys who fight - it didn't seem to deep, but I thought it would provide entertainment. I had heard buzz about, a few of my friends raved about it for a few days, and I was convinced. I should see this movie. I went to my local video store and picked up the last remaining DVD. I popped it in, sat in amazement until the last credit rolled, and then watched it again. And again. And again.This movie is dark and disturbing, however, it is equally smart and stylistic. I found it hard to watch at points, but I couldn't turn my eyes away. Fight Club makes many bold statements against the modern consumer-driven society, and produces Norton's best performance and Pitt's second best (12 Monkeys).Norton plays an average-Joe who is living a dead-end life. He needs something to change his life. Tyler and Marla will take care of this, and that is all I want to give away. Other comments will tell you more, but I suggest you let it all sink in while watching. As for it's ending, it doesn't rival 'The Sixth Sense' - it blows it away. One of the best movie endings I've seen. Even better if you're a Pixies fan.As for it being important, don't worry. You will be hearing about this movie. When 'A Clockwork Orange' came out, it was met with mixed reviews, deemed too dark and violent, and is now considered a classic. These two movies share quite a bit in common - both were based on great books. If you haven't read either, get to it. Politicians will use this movie as a demonstration of careless and consequence-less violence in movies, and as a perfect example of what today's youth are being influenced by.Watch this movie, and watch it again with some of your more intelligent friends. 10 out of 10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

",,"Wow, if you haven't already seen this movie... get to it! When i first heard about this movie,I had no idea what it was about, a few years ago i had finally rented it, and boy was i in for a treat. Starting off, the narrator in fight club was such a brilliant piece, giving the audience someone to relate to, and giving the narrator someone to lay his thought out besides himself. The narrator then meets tyler durden,and they quickly become business partners in a meeting the created called fights club, now i cant say much, due to the first rule about fight club, but i can say, if you choose to watch, you wont be disappointed",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Everything a movie should be: entertaining, thought provoking, and inspiring.
",spoiler,"What is important in life? I could probably right my entire review solely about how this movie addresses that question. And that would leave about ten vital themes unexamined. There seems to be a lot of controversy over what sort of points the story tries to make, but I don't think it's trying to make you believe anything. All it's saying is that your life is most likely not what it could be and that you need to slap yourself in the face and do something about it. They don't care what you do, all they care is that you do *something*.After all, this is where the Narrator starts his journey. Even though visiting the support groups doesn't get him where he wants to be, it is a vital first step in his chaotic spiral into finding himself. Eventually, he realizes that combating consumerism and corporate lifestyle has gone too far and he feels responsible. The pendulum of his lifestyle has swung from one extreme to the other instead of resting in the middle, and now he has led thousands of other men to the same unhealthy level of change. But I think it would be more consistent with the theme to say that the members of Fight Club brought themselves into their current state. Tyler and the Narrator just started it; they could not have brought it to Project Mayhem level if not for the passion of each member. All of them need the same thing the Narrator does.Another central theme is chaos. We are, even seventeen years later, a society that is obsessed with feeling in control. You need look no further than our culture-defining superheroes that battle the ""agents of chaos"". Tyler introduces the Narrator to the positive outcomes of chaos and shows him that being in control of your life is only possible if you aren't in control at all. In trying to reject all suffering through the contents of his apartment, the Narrator has made himself incapable of dealing with suffering. This leads to what was the most striking scene of the film for me: the hand burning, and Tyler's speech about the beauty of accepting pain ""like a living person"". Tyler seems pretty disgusted with how the Narrator initially handles the loss of his apartment and how he fails to see it as a chance to start over.Of course, we can't forget Marla Singer, who is probably as important to the Narrator's life behavior as Tyler is. The Narrator claims to hate her because of how much she reminds him of himself. In that sense, maybe his mind created Tyler as a way to fight off Marla, since Tyler is who he wishes he were. Then again, the Narrator never fully commits to either side of this internal battle. But neither of them seem to fully respect him, which I guess says a lot about the Narrator's self-esteem.In an execution sense, it was amazing. The story is paced so fast that ten minutes feels like fifteen because of how much is packed into them. The dialogue is spot on the entire time, not wasting one line on information about the ""world of the story"" because we all live in the world of the story: it's our lives. Even the voice-over, an element that can often be problematic, was applied perfectly. And to top that off, it was the screenwriter's first feature script. The actors finish the job by bringing the characters wonderfully to life. The camera-work and directing were both incredible as well, drawing you fully into the emotion of the scene, and the dingy color scheme set a constant mood of dissatisfaction and the garbage-like nature of the Narrator's life.I can understand if people are put off by some of the themes discussed in the movie or its portrayal of violence, but including those things does not mean that they are promoting them. To say that this film promotes violence or asocial behavior is to look at it with a limited scope and miss the true message. I know it may seem like I gave too much of a fanboy's perspective, which is understandable since I consider this movie as second only to Inception. But my opinion aside, I think that this is a movie that pretty much everybody should see at some point between the ages of 16 and 50 because, like it or not, it is a film about your life to some extent. Overall Rating: 9.5/10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" My Favorite Movie
",,"I watched this movie for 10 times. This is excellent. This movie is best. Watch before die because you find too many thing from world and from yourself. Some people say ""Fight Club ? It is nice."". No no no. This movie needs better words like ""Perfect"" like ""Impossible"". Watch this movie anyway.There has been some controversy about the violence in this film but it is not gratuitous violence, it is part of the story and serves it well. It is much less than what you would see in your average Hollywood blockbuster. This is actually an insightful film and in many ways similar to American Beauty, although this film is much more in your face about it's message. If you are squeamish, you may not want to see it. There are some very painful bloody scenes, but if you can stomach it, then check it out. There is also a huge twist in this film that almost rivals the twist at the end of The Sixth Sense. And I must admit, it is the twist in this film that made me really love it. The best audience for this film is men in their 20's or 30's, but anyone that can appreciate film as a modern art should like it. One of the best films of 1999.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" This movie will leave you in awe.
",,"Fight club is a movie by David Fincher and star Edward Norton as...well, its not clear but he's called the narrator and Brad Pitt as Tyler Durden. It stars with with the last act of the film but then takes us back to the star. We see the Narrator and he tell us about how he has insomnia which has taken a toll on his mentality making him look lifeless and tired. He works for an automotive company with means he has to travel all the time and record wrecked cars from accidents. On one of his travels he mets Tyler Durden, a free spirited guy with a disdain for consumerism and confirmative society. He's views and ideas are appealing to the Narrator and circumstances lead them to live together. After a short time, they started a club where men from different walks of life can join and in this club, members fight each other one on one till one surrenders. Firstly, I would like to say that is one of the best story in film. The script is one the smartest I've ever seen. The first act feels like a dream like world with The Narrator's smooth, simple description of the events of his life. Personally, I could related very well to him, during the time in which I first saw the movie, I was in the midst of an insomniac phase similar to the Narrator. I watched the movie movie with some of my friends and saw them getting lost as the movie progresses. They were expecting some brain dead action flick that has Brad Pitt in it. All of them dose of eventually while I was left glued to the spectacle of events that transitions in the movie. Tyler Durden, Brad's character is such a memorable guy that makes him seem larger than live. The lines in he delivers are absolutely brilliant and make you question the norms of life and exactly how absurd they really are for example "" We're consumers. We are byproducts of a lifestyle obsession "". His view's made us question our life goals and how much of what we do is just society telling us we should do. This is the power of this movie. And when I said earlier that it's not a brainless action movie that doesn't this movie is a bore fess. Its a very intriguing with mixture of action, psychological thriller, comedy(the humor is frequent and well done) and mystery. There are a few questions I had that were answered at the end. Overall, this movie is deserving of the people's praises and cemented David Fincher as a brilliant, unique director who brings a tone and look to this film which complements the story well. The movie cinematography looks awesome and I couldn't believe it came out in 1099 it look more like a 2010's movie. Fight club is one of my all time favorite movie and I highly recommend you see it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" My Opinion: Fight Club
",,"This Movie it's just great! One of the films which EVERYONE has the obligation to see. The critic to the consumerism in our society in it it's so deep and intense and it tell us that in great dialogs. And of course, it's the best David Fincher's movie ever directed with great performances by an brilliant cast. Again. everyone has to see it. We actually feel the frustration of the character with this world. We believe that our lives will be great and awesome but that ain't going to happen. And this movie shows us that fact. It opens our eyes to where we're living and it makes us doubt if we are indeed living. Again, the way that this movie tells us not to be dependent of what we have and to be prepare that our lives ain't going to be that great but still we can make a difference, it's great. We do have a lot of potential. Just like this movie. So, let's live like we really should. But first, watch this movie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" It is the Greatest, indescribable & The BEST Movie i've ever watched
",spoiler,"It's not original anymore to like this film and cinephiles often roll their eyes when they hear this film mentioned for the millionth time, but I still think Fight Club is 100% pure awesomeness! It's easy to see why this became such a cult favorite after its initial failure at the box office. It's just a very good and completely crazy film experience!Fincher directed this film with a lot of confidence and wasn't afraid to do some very strange stuff. The result is a weird, but oddly satisfying film with a lot of violence, a rebellious philosophy, three great leading performances, a plot full of odd twists, a whole bunch of memorable scenes and an occasional male genital that suddenly appears in the corner of the screen for a very quick moment.The first rule of Fight Club is to not take it too seriously, though. It may sometimes be tempting to relate to the main character's apathy and disconnection from the world and be convinced by Tyler Durden's appealing speeches against our contemporary society (especially because they contain certain inevitable truths), but at the end the film actually criticizes every single idea it has promoted during its course. Fight Club works best as a very well made satirical dark comedy. I mean, the third act must be one of the silliest things I've ever seen on a screen, but it's so well made and so hugely entertaining and freaking hilarious, that I can't help but be engaged every time I see it. It has become known as one of the greatest and most notorious endings of all time, and rightly so. It's fresh, it's cool, it's wild and it's funny as hell. This is also my favorite Fincher movie .I am not ashamed to say it out loud: I LOVE FIGHT CLUB! It's one of the most spectacular filmmaking achievements of recent years and the fact that it has now become part of our mainstream pop culture doesn't change that for me.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Probably one of my favorite movies.
",,"I think the plot twist is very particular, it's a kind of movie that plays with your brain, it gives you joy and also sadness, i don't know if i can describe everything you feel while you're watching it, for me it's very important how you're feeling through the movie, and i love it when i can be laughing at something and then feel terrible about a character. For me, it was easy to get attracted to Norton's character, really simple and mundane, nothing special. I've not read the book yet, probably i will do it someday, but i know a book cannot be compared to a movie, they're different but i'm sure they have the same essence. I know it's easy to find movies like this, i watched recently ""the revenant"" and it gave me a similar feeling, i was up, and then was down, i was happy, but then concerned, movies are feelings, not just shots or frames or if it has a good photography, it helps of course, but as a screenwriter, i'd like to think about the screenplay and characters more than anything else.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Screw rule no. 1...
",,"... this needs to be talked about. I was way too young to enjoy this when it first came out but it has been on my watchlist (both the literal one here on IMDb but also before that on the more abstract one in my head) for a lot of years now since it's such a classic. But it has sadly also been one of those movies you don't think you're ready for yet, like you're saving them for that one perfect day, and so I never went on to actually watching it. Until yesterday.I really enjoyed the whole film and the thing contributing to that matter the most is probably the plot. It's all very intriguing and original from start to finish with lots of twists and turns and interesting character development. I also really like the special effects where the camera kind of zooms in, or goes through things, to a microscopical level, looks really cool. Although it kind of felt like they gave that whole thing up a while into the movie, and I sadly feel like that took some of the built up mystery and feel away. But it's all okay in the end since this masterpiece of a movie came to inspire the makers of many of my other favourite movies and TV-series. It's just worth the watch, you know?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Great Critique of Anti-establishment and Masculinity
",,"To me this film is great in the sense that it provokes me enough to see messages perhaps exceeding the original intent of both the author and the film maker. The irony is that the film in really serves as a strong critique against the two main characteristics that Tylor represents: anti-establishment and masculinity. To begin with, the movie was produced by one of the biggest media corporates in the world, cashing on the corporate hatred and self- hatred generated precisely by those corporates. The crowd who followed Tylor thinking that they are liberated from the capitalist treadmill are in fact merely shifting from one treadmill to another. Same as the fascist followers who felt empowered carrying out the orders, in the process of working for Tylor they are really being exploited and given a tiny share of the power and resources they gathered - exactly the same as working for a company. Will their lives really change after credit records are destroyed? We have seen how communist revolutions rose and fell. What is, then, the whole point of the movement? It is a project of the protagonist set out to find his own value, instead of being defined by others. It is a process that requires internal examination and self-awareness. The crowd he draws is used for his personal project; eventually he becomes aware of his other self, Tylor, examined his own actions and those of Tylor's, and finds peace again with himself.Another mockery the film makes is towards the concept of masculinity. I quickly noticed the crowd drawn by Tylor consists only males, and the character itself is the projection of perfect masculinity perceived by the society. In a civilised society where powerful positions no longer require physical strength, certain male members feel a great sense of insecurity – exactly the members fight club attracts. Frustrated by their failure to gain influence in the establishment, they go to the gym and boxing clubs to regain confidence, or engage in reckless behaviours to show how daring they are. The film portrayed these people as flat in character and seemingly stupid. The only trait that sets Tylor apart from them is his intelligence. In fact, it was the intelligent part of him that woke him up from the corporate slavery, not the masculine part. Violence and sex are used as a tool to express power, but after the short-lived pleasure derived from the power trip, the ensuing wounds and pain are long-lasting. While Tylor dominated Marla in bed, the protagonist does not even feel the pleasure from sex. In the end, the feminine and powerless Marla saves the protagonist by reconnecting the conflicting parts of him and completes his self- searching journey. My mood was manipulated by the film the first time I saw it; the motivational speech about self-discovery and pursuit of passion sold me. But when I realised they were blindly targeting companies, I suddenly realised the stupidity of the ideology with which the crowd was bonded, and from that departure, I felt alienated from the protagonist and from the film and was able to see the bigger picture. From the interviews of the author and the director I did not see the same interpretation I had, however, I believe an art piece has its own life after its creation. From cinematographic perspective, this is a very well made film. Once again Fincher did an excellent job. I recommend this film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" The first rule of Fight Club
",,"FIGHT CLUB premiered in the US with a wave of publicity focusing on its violence and nihilism; some critics countered this with the statement that it was an anti-materialist jeremiad. On a 2nd watching of the film, it seems like neither to me. It's easier to see it as a thoughtful, strong and complex movie. Director David Fincher once again dazzles us with his work, which is as brilliantly energetic as the acting of Brad Pitt and also talented Edward Norton.What's really impressive is the manner in which the film manages to tease us with an anti- materialist, hyper- masculine message even as it suggests that we're all a little too sophisticated to buy into it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" David Fincher's Fight Club
",,"We follow the narrator, played by Edward Norton, as he struggles with insomnia and the lack of meaning in his life. Fight Club was directed by David Fincher and written by Jim Uhls, based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk. It's a Dark Comedy which explores the ironies of our society, Fincher holds a mirror in our face show how disgusting we are and then he makes us laugh at this. This movie is masterfully directed and edited, beautifully filmed and decorated, it features some of the best performances by both Edward Norton and Brad Pitt. It is hard to understand what people didn't see when it came out, even though the magic was a bit lost when this movie became so popular, that now holds the tenth spot in the IMDb's Top 250, in my opinion it deserves this status, if not to compensate the hate or indifference it received when it came out then for its achievements as a stupendously well done movie. It deserves a 10 in my view.

And the viewer gets excited because he wants to know who is Tyler Durden. This kind of movie is the BEST because you want to know more. this movie is like Shutter Island or Memento. It's a type of film that you need to watch until the end otherwise you miss things, there's things unexplained, and that's not the only reason, also because the screenplay is Genius and the cinematography is also great.This is a masterpiece by David Fincher. If you watch this movie you love it and think it's one of the greatest ever, or you hate and think it's a waste of time. When i watched it for the first time i felt i was watching something unique.

" This is a must see
",spoiler,"spoiler alertFor me, it's just as good as the Chuck Palahniuk book it's based on. The story of this potent work follows a nameless narrator who deals with his sad, lonely existence by becoming addicted to support groups for issues he doesn't have, but fakes, mostly because he finds the attention comforting. His addiction changes from support groups to underground fighting matches with other disaffected men after he meets the kooky soap salesman Tyler Durden. From there, things really start to spiral, but I'm not saying anymore, as part of the joy is experiencing things unfolding for one's self.The actors do so well with their characters that it's hard to imagine anyone else playing the parts, and not only that, but they become the characters, and you forget that they are really just actors. Fincher's dark and hypnotic style works perfectly with this material, and the editing is also really good. This movie isn't really about dudes beating each other up in underground fighting venues. It's a critique of masculinity, being marginalized by society, and a major attack against gross materialism and consumerism. This is catharsis at it's finest.I first saw this when I was a sophomore in high school the same week I first saw Reservoir Dogs and Taxi Driver, and I was never the same after that. Those three films are what lead me to become the rabid film buff that I am, and the rebellious and disaffected nature of the protagonist here really spoke to me, and I found myself really able to identify with a lot of the stuff going on here.I suppose the film is perhaps a tad overrated, and, unlike the book, the twist doesn't work quite as well, but even then, this film is a powerful, compelling, and amazing work of art. Also, given the content, it really amazes me (still) that this was a mainstream production. Bottom line, this is a must see.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" what a movie
",,"listering, hallucinatory, often brilliant, the film by David Fincher is a combination punch of social satire and sociopathology. Fight Club may be iconic and technically proficient, but it's more distant than perhaps any film to attain ""modern classic"" status. The trajectory of Fight Club is baffling. In its first hour or so, this picture appears to be a gloriously spiteful and well-acted satire of our bogus contemporary ""crisis of masculinity"": self- pitying guys hugging in groups and claiming victim status - modern consumer society having allegedly rendered the poor dears' hunter- gathering instincts obsolete. But, by the end, it has unravelled catastrophically into a strident, shallow, pretentious bore with a ""twist"" ending that doesn't work. And it is a film which smugly flirts, oh-so-very- controversially, with some of the intellectual and cultural paraphernalia of fascism - but does not have anything like the nerve, still less the cerebral equipment, to back this pose up.Edward Norton gives a compulsively twitchy, nerdy, hollow-eyed performance as Fight Club's Narrator: a 30-year-old single guy with a white collar job in the automotive industry and a secret addiction; he loves attending support groups posing as a sufferer. Hilariously, this is the only thing that gives him an emotional high.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" An exhilarating journey in understanding consumerism through aggressive events.
",,"Fight Club is one such rare movie that deserves to win many nominations and awards,clearly and literally.It is one the best films of 1999.This dark story takes place through the unnamed protagonist-The Narrator essayed by a brilliant Edward Norton.He delivers a power-packed,energetic,deep-in-the-character performance which is immensely commendable.Although most of the movie is shot in dark,lurid atmosphere and there is no glitterati or lights.Edward Norton suffers from chronic insomnia and cant sleep for days together.The only way he can find peace,solace and ultimately sleep is by going to various body- afflicted problem groups where seeing people suffering a plethora of pain makes him calm and retains his composure.Here he meets a weird emo-like woman named Marla Singer portrayed equally well by a weird- looking Helena Bonham Carter who has a lot of uncanny(peculiar)idiosyncrasies.He creates a virtual and visual alter-ego or a persona named Tyler Durden acted by the most exuberant,jovial and boisterous Brad Pitt.He clearly gave and electrifying,stellar performance that deserves sheer accolades.How he takes on the monster of Tyler Durden forms the crux of the story.Tyler is a nihilist who creates a ""fight club"" to ease the tension,agony and anguish of the people living boring,mundane,robotic lives.A clear must-watch if you want to understand consumerism in a novel but violent way.Thumbs UP!!!MY RATING-9 ON 10.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A depressed, lonely, man meets the charismatic Tyler Durden. Together, they start a therapeutic club where people can beat the hell out of each other. Fight Club.
",,"When Fight Club was released in 1999, it was critically panned by critics. This remains a mystery to me. Perhaps they did not understand the subtle and dark implications this film has to offer. Perhaps they did not appreciate the eerie and dark tone. Maybe it was the dark comedy that they didn't take into account. Fight Club remains one of my favorite movies for those three reasons and many more. Fincher created a hysterically dark yet emotionally powerful masterpiece that has very little equals. I could go on about the fantastic, career defining performances by just about every single person in this film, or I could go on about the brilliant and thought- provoking third act, ended beautifully by the intentionally incomplete ending, but I'm sure you've heard it all before. Fight Club is a love it or hate it film. It's one that should be watched multiple times for an adequate experience, and it's one that you should keep a topic of conversation for years to come. Fight club demands your attention.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" wonderful classic!
",,"Fight Club is an extraordinary film that depicts the life of a (not really) average Joe who seems to have met the perfect new best friend to spice up his life. Why anyone would dislike this movie is beyond me. Yes, it's pretty graphic and violent, but it was a new outlook on an underground activity that hadn't been approached much before. Along with that, it touched on the human mind and what it's actually capable of doing. At the box office, the film only reached around 37 million, in contrast to their estimated budget, which was 63 million. Why did this movie bomb? Maybe it was bad promotion, maybe people didn't realize how hot Brad Pitt was (and still is), but whatever the case, it's still a legendary movie. Almost anyone knows the famous line, ""first rule of fight club, don't talk about fight club."" It's widely recognized and changed into many different varieties, even 14 years later. And the ending is a real shocker! You wouldn't see it coming. When the DVD was released, word spread much more quickly about small details in the film you wouldn't have noticed in the theater. People wanted to analyze the plot twist for themselves. The thought that was put into making this whole movie come together is wonderful, and I think many movies lately need to use this movie as an example of how to correctly write a memorable classic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Fight Club uses low key lighting and many dutch angle and hand-held shots to give the viewer the feeling that they are present for the fights. Both Non-diegetic and diegetic sound play an extremely important role in the movie, often accounting for the Narrator's hallucination, which comes on the form of Tyler Durden, whom we later find out is a result of the Narrator's insomnia.

Yup that's word that comes to mind when I think of this movie. Brad Pitt emulsified the rendition of pretty-boy meets tough. Not only did he depict himself in a whole new light, but he enlightened my opinions on Edward Norton. Edward Norton's American History X and Fight Club have become the core film's that have gained my utmost respect for his work.When I met Pitt, he wasn't any different. He brings the family man he is to the table, that dedication and loyalty to set, and most of all; trust and 110% effort to his career and colleagues.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" First Rule of the Fight Club.
",spoiler,"Okay, so I am not exactly breaking the rules in talking about the Fight Club. If you're reading this, you've seen it so there is no point in keeping silent. After seeing this again last night, I decided to share my views on it. As evidence shows on the Top 250 list... Fight Club is one of the greatest films of all time. First, let's talk about the cast: Edward Norton was a great choice, we can see that he has had to loose the beef from his previous credit, American History X, but this gave it an, almost, realistic approach to the film. He wasn't quite how the character is described in the book, but we can let that off, he still looked pretty fantastic, even in the insomniac look. Brad Pitt was an almost perfect casting, he was no longer a pretty boy who couldn't act. He was a great god on the screen, he fitted the role and, in my eyes, portrayed Tyler almost perfectly. We all know that H,B-C was a good cast, she's nearly crazier than Tim Burton... Which fits the role.Now we can move onto the Film vs Book argument. Obviously they have to change certain parts of the book to make it fit into a 100-150 minute film, otherwise they'd do what happened to The Hobbit. The ends of both the film and the novel differ drastically. In the novel, the Narrator does shoot himself through the cheek, just as Jack does in the film. What happens next in both stories is quite different. In the film, Jack is reunited with Marla and they watch the buildings disappear from the skyline. In the book, the Narrator shoots himself but then wakes up in what he believes is Heaven, however it is described that Jack is actually in a mental institution. The Narrator believes his psychiatrist to be God. Now, that is the biggest difference made, yes there are other big changes, yes there are story changing tweaks, but I did this one because it is a stand out difference. In my opinion, I am not too bothered by the change, it makes it more applicable to a film. It brings us into suspense as we try to figure out what happens after: Does the building blow up? Does Jack die by Marla's side? As the transition to the credits appear, it is obvious, though that is only a flash, it may be a reference to one of Tyler's jobs. Feel free to respond and counteract. This is my first review.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Read this review
",,"Roger Ebert says the second half of this movie turns into the most unremitting violence ever shown on film. He says the movie makes the mistake of masquerading as philosophical, and the point of the movie was probably taken the wrong way by many viewers. Roger Ebert is my favorite movie reviewer of all time, but he is dead wrong. Whatever you take away from Fight Club is whatever you take away. It is what is. This is the smartest movie I have ever watched and the best movie of 1999. You should definitely see this movie. Talk about it with your parents, smart friends, dumb friends. Different people see the point of this movie in different ways. At the end of the day, Fight Club does one simple thing. It empowers people to live more productive lives. Do something new, be a part of life. Or don't. Be the most productive person you can be in whatever you want to be productive in. Fight Club- 10/10",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Don't talk about Fight Club
",,"The first rule of Fight Club is ""Don't talk about Fight Club."" But we're going to break the first rule of Fight Club and talk about Fight Club.Fight Club is possibly one of the last original movies made, before Hollywood started ripping off, reimagining and remaking everything that ever made Tinseltown money. So if for some reason, if you haven't seen Fight Club yet, when you get done reading this, go out and rent Fight Club.A good movie for me is one that does not end with the credits. And Fight Club is a good movie. And one that stays with you long after the credits begin rolling.I can't praise the cast enough of this movie enough here. Brad Pitt (Who I'm not a fan of by the way) is perfectly cast as Tyler Durden (and he seems to be having a very good time here) Helena Bonham Carter can always be relied upon for a good performance, here once again, she is superb. As for Edward Norton, it became apparent the year before this movie, with 'American History X' that he was one talented actor destined for great performances in great roles. His first movie was opposite Richard Gere in Primal Fear in 1996. He was nominated for an Oscar for Best Supporting actor which he lost to Cuba Gooding Jr. for 'Jerry Maguire' He also won a Golden Globe. Not bad for his first time out. He the. Worked with Woody Allen before his second Oscar Nomination for 'American History X' he lost this time to Roberto Benigni for 'Life is Beautiful'. Benigni also beat out Tom Hanks for 'Saving Private Ryan'. Boy did the Academy get that one wrong!But this was to be his last great movie. (As of 2014 at least) He has had had a few minor hits since then but there has been something missing in most of his work between then and now. So, what the hell happened?Bottom line, Norton got a reputation for being difficult. Lots of people think of Norton as an absolute control freak. That Norton is not someone you want to work with.Also, Norton isn't shy about airing his opinions to anyone who will listen. If Norton feels like he hasn't gotten the credit he is due, he will shout it from the rooftops. If he isn't happy with the final cut of a movie, he simply promote it. That is frowned on in Hollywood where stars are expected to support their movies no matter what.Brad Pitt (as I've said I'm not a fan) settled for being a famous A List superstar than making good movies I often said outside the Oceans Franchise ensemble, and with the exception of 'Inglorious Basterds' and 'The Assassination of Jessie James By The Coward Robert Ford' Pitt has not made a good movie since Seven. But I love his performance here. I don't believe another actor could have played the role of Tyler Durden as well as Pitt.But back to the movie.Given the talent involved, I'm not surprised this found an audience despite the premise of the movie. The studio wanted to market Fight Club to women because of Pitt. But they knew the film's violence would appeal more to men. It was a tricky one. In the end they hired an ad agency. They did a great job of promoting a tricky movie. Go watch Fight Club.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Dramatic, Romantic, Funny, Brutal. What more could you want?!
",spoiler,"The Fight Club is probably one of the greatest movie ever created that combines so many Genres and made a masterpiece. This movie is about a guy that narrates his life story through out the movie. What makes it interesting is while he is narrating he doesn't realize his illusions and just narrates what he thinks is real. The movie starts out with a sad entrance and kind of dramatic about an average American person with a job that makes good money and in the process he discovers his Brutal side. Now, what made him violent is that he met a guy on a plane who he admired and happened to turn out to be his friend after he found out his apartment was on fire and he needed a place to crash. His friend made opened his eyes about how his life is boring and needs to change. They start by fighting and than starting a fight club. So far, the movie is just dramatic, sad, and brutal.

" It Had Some Major Problems For Me
",,"So I re-watched Fight Club for the first time in a few years, having liked it very much the first time. David Fincher is a fantastic director and the directing in this movie is pretty fantastic. The editing and other elements are also of highest order, as Fincher's films usually are. My problems with the film lie within the script, which seems to get totally lost in itself. Fight Club's themes of consumerism and materialism and existentialism are obvious, since they are in the foreground, not tying to hide in the background for interpretation. If you think you're a movie buff for understanding this, you're not. It's simple to understand but is at the same time thought provoking, since the movie is about big ideas. Free yourself from society. Accept that your life is meaningless. Destroy yourself to find out who you really are. You are capable of more than you think. Fight Club states these ideas as blatantly as I just did. It shows the main characters being freed and we root for them, but really, do we see a whole lot of benefit to this lifestyle? The film seems to suggest that there is an extent to which this lifestyle becomes dangerous and is unhealthy, yet the film still glorifies it, suggesting no middle ground as to how far we should carry out its philosophies, other than going insane and causing an apocalypse. Another problem I felt was that the ""space monkeys"" in the film are all freeing themselves from being slaves to their possessions and society, yet they act like drones when embracing Tyler's philosophies. They become just as much victims to fight club and project mayhem as they were to their societies rules.Is the point of the movie to lose yourself in these ideas? To become a slave to new philosophies in exchange for being a slave to society? The last few minutes seems to suggest that Norton's character regrets his actions and that he has gone too far, but where, does the film suggest, is the middle ground? Despite all this, Fight Club is electrifying and hyper throughout in a way that few movies are and for that it is worth seeing. The ideas are good, but lose track of themselves. Only fanboys think this is one of the best films of all time. It's not, you only like it cause it's cool and you think you're a member of a cult.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" brilliant film that entertains as well as enlightens.
",spoiler,"Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), a charismatic soap salesman whose straightforward honesty, candor and sleazy lounge-lizard outfits are a breath of fresh air. One night, after the two men have bonded over beers, Tyler asks the narrator to hit him. At first, it seems like an absurd request but after they pound on each other for a bit, a strange feeling overcomes them. They feel a kind of release and satisfaction at inflicting pain on one another. In a world where people are desensitized to everything around them, the physical contact of fighting wakes them up and makes them feel truly alive. Others soon join in and pretty soon Fight Club becomes an underground sensation. However, it becomes readily apparent that Tyler has more elaborate plans than just organizing brawls at the local bar. David Fincher has taken the dark, pessimistic worldview of ""Seven"" and married it with the clever plot twists and turns of ""The Game"" and assembled his strongest effort to date. ""Fight Club"" is a $50+ million studio film that remains true to its anti- consumer, anti-society, anti-everything message -- right up to the last, sneaky subliminal frame. What makes ""Fight Club"" a subversive delight is not only its refreshing anti-corporate message but how it delivers said message. As Fincher has explained in interviews, you don't really watch the film but rather download it. Its structure is extremely playful as it messes around with linear time to an incredible degree. The narrative bounces back and forth all over the place like a novel, or surfing on the Internet -- even making a hilarious dead stop to draw attention to itself in a funny, interesting way that completely works. Yet Norton's deadpanned narration holds everything together and allows the viewer to get a handle on what's happening. This is the way films should be made. Why must we always have to go through the A+B+C formula?",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Outcome after seeing this movie
",,"This movie shows what the office goers are feeling deep inside. Its basically a freedom fighting movie. Freedom from our boundaries, from society and our morals. Our worlds's rules were drawn by cowards who can't think out of box. This movie is a real encouragement for all young office goers to make their future spicy.Tyler shows you the path, you must take the decision to follow it. If you want yo make you life interesting follow your heart says. Just let it all out. Don't care about anyone other than yourself, ultimately you are the one who has to suffer the consequences of you activity anyway, so just do whatever you want and don't regret for doing nothing in the future.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" It is beyond masterpiece
",spoiler,"What's make the film good is not only the visual effects, act, direction. Beyond than this,is the affect for each audience who watch the film. And of course, ""Fight Club"" did this. Maybe, people who think this movie worse is only don't get the point of this movie. I think this is a very critical movie. It criticize the modern life of lifestyle and also comfort zone. You know, the modern human is like drown in the sophisticated era of technology and economic. Human is like a object of brands of product. You know, even I am confused how to described the message of this movie. Because it is pretty deep and buried down in our mind.What is the great deal, is also the plot. What an unpredictable story! And about the fight, how can the fight doesn't mean a fight at all. So that the only genre of ""Fight Club"" is drama. The fight is a representation of the real feeling of human in this age. I just can choose the way to say what kind of masterpiece is.

" Arguably the best movie ever made
",,"The movie was directed by David Fincher, also responsible for the twisted masterpiece Se7en, and revolves around the main character who for all intensive purposes will be called ""The Narrator"", played by one of my favourite actors: Edward Norton. The Narrator meets a man named Tyler Durden (Brad Pitt), who goes on to completely change his outlook on life, opening him up to what is truly his full potential, and encouraging him to leave behind his old monotonous life and ""just let go.""It's difficult to explain why Fight Club is the incredible experience it is without spoiling anything. The main misconception is that the movie focuses on fighting, which is a fair assumption, based upon the name, but it is almost inexcusable to disregard it without delving a little deeper. About one tenth of the film contains fighting, with the remainder telling an unforgettable story of self-discovery and leaving you as the viewer to raise some questions about yourself and precisely where you think your own life is going. It's clichéd with many highly- rated films, but Fight Club really is life changing if you allow it to be. It'd be wrong to review the film without touching on just how exceptional the acting is. Marla, (played by Helena Bonham Carter) is the embodiment of a wasted life, counting down the days till she dies. Her life, like The Narrator's, completely changes when she meets Tyler, providing even the most depressive character in the film a new way of seeing things. Brad Pitt plays Tyler perfectly, not caring at all how people see him and being his own man, something which he encourages The Narrator to do. The true reason Fight Club is so phenomenal as a film however is down to the fact it was made with the sole purpose of being watched again, thanks to the completely mind-blowing twist featured towards the end. I can't put in to words just how shocked I was after the first time I saw the film, leaving me to instantly need to see it again. If there was ever a reason to see Fight Club, the twist alone would be it.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Yes, it is actually the best movie ever made!

I know lots of people that do not seem to be captivated by the specific film,its concept, or it characters. And to be honest, i do not want to persuade them over this!!! I want this movie not to be liked by everyone(like Shawshank Redemption for example). I want this movie for myself!!I consider this movie as one that you will like it for your own unique reasons, and this is its true power. There is no point in giving you reasons for justifying my view, as it may differ from yours.I have read the book after watching the film, and i must say that Fincher made a hell of a job to materialize on screen a book not so easy to be adapted (it is not Dan Brown if you know what i mean).

" Strange and surreal movie
",spoiler,"The pretty and smooth Brad Pitt along with the sweet and bashful Edward Norton as the couple of a blood dripping undercover fight club, rolling in the gutter with broken teeth, swelling eyes, and bloody faces in a secret underground game.Could the filmmakers and writers make me believe such a story, or make me care? Well, director David Fincher did. I went to the theatre and saw this movie with an open mind, confident with the notion that this would be a pure fighting action movie. However, I was dragged into a story blacker than night. It embraces widely, it puts its grip around consumerism - the Ikea generation where brands and advertising defines our identity as hollow and poor. We are left quivering with strength, but empty of something meaningful; that's the message of this story.Here we are trapped in a world of shopping culture, but is it about an identity crisis, some kind of revolution, or straight up terror? I couldn't really tell. The movie is quite surreal, a struggle between two people who become something totally different.Very good performances from the three main actors. The movie has a dark and visual power, and turned out to be quite disturbing, but it was very fascinating - and very good!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Its brilliance cannot be described by words alone
",,"After getting tired of the crap that had been coming out of Hollywood for a past year or so,I decided to give old movies a chance. I thoroughly enjoyed the Matrix and Lord of the rings trilogies.Then,I stumbled upon Fight Club.The thought of two men starting a club to help vent male aggression didn't impress me much. After all,what could possibly be special about this to give this movie a rating of 8.8 on IMDb. I dimmed the lights and cranked the volume up.From the beginning,something felt right. There was an indescribable feeling in Edward Norton's voice over that agreed with me. Like his character, I too was tired of the day to day routine,the same crap that we do everyday and the petty things that we are made to run after in everyday life. Like him,I too despised that are minds were controlled through commercials and advertisements by corporations to keep us buying crap that we probably don't ever need. Another thing came poring over through me and that was the supposed significance of having names like Calvin Klein, Armani etc on your garments. A shirt should be a shirt whether it has cK written on it should not make a difference. As the movie progressed, feelings of rebellion grew in me. I wanted to leave everything and fight against the present system. Fighting against these urges ,I controlled myself with great difficulty. I didn't care much about the end, as the film had delivered beyond my wildest expectations This movie made me a fan of David Fincher. Also Brad Pitt,who I thought was successful due to just his pretty face, elevated in respect in my mind. One of the top 3 films as far as I'm concerned",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" High on adrenalin and visually inventive
",,"This often pretty brutal examination of the male psyche is certainly a very dynamic piece of film-making. David Fincher has to be given a great deal of credit for imbuing his film with an enormous amount of energy and invention. It's a movie infused with adrenalin both thematically and stylistically. So job well done. The two lead actors are massive in contributing to this. Ed Norton supplies the edge, while Brad Pitt the movie star charisma. Both are ideal in their respective roles. There is a wicked sense of humour present throughout the film with a number of very funny moments. While the sense of the bizarre is ever present. This is hardly a realist strand of film-making. Fight Club is a dramatic film that is very fantastical. It doesn't really make it's intentions very clear cut. It leaves you the audience to decide for yourself what you make of it. This no doubt contributed to it's initial failure at the box office. It requires a bit more work from the viewer than most films. But it is also one of those movies that demands to be re-watched; it comes at you from an entirely different angle when you know the outcome in advance. Definitely one of the 90's most original studio releases.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Fight Club delivers a deep message even though many might not see it.
",spoiler,"Fight Club may seem just about letting go and stop trying to control everything and venting out your anger so that it just doesn't explode inside you every time you're on the verge of..well exploding. But it's about more than that. It delivers a message about thinking about your life and realising that you've submitted to commercialism, to hypocrisy and to consumerism. All the fights and all the explosions and the sex in this movie are just covers for what actually goes on. They're just the in between parts of a movie that are minor details. And just what this movie does is treat its message like a minor detail so that those who truly pay attention figure it out. The most beautiful scene in the entire movie is when Tyler forces the grocer to follow his dream, albeit in an unconventional way. And that scene is the gist of the entire movie. Fight Club was a very unusual movie in that it left me unsure and uncertain of what to think of it. I kept thinking about what the film was getting at, what it was trying to teach me and like the narrator I was also distracted by the unneeded and unimportant details of the movie that was his life. The deep rooted message was to live your life and not get caught up with the farce that the world has become. When Tyler tells the narrator that the things we own end up owning us, he's talking to you. And you better listen because he's telling the truth. The otherwise violent and sexually perverted parts of the film are why I cut three points off this film's score, the reason I give it 7 is because of its deep rooted message and the way it delivers it. I do not say that it is a perfect film, (far from it) it could've been much much better and that goes for the book as well, but it does deliver a message and a good one at that, one which sinks in. Unlike the pathetic film and book that was ""A Clockwork Orange.""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" What it feels like to be abducted by Aliens
",,"I must have been beamed up to a flying saucer at the exact period when I was watching this movie because it feels now that I'm back on earth among the human race again, that I have a totally different view of this film than everyone else. I hated it. It must be me, after reading so many positive reviews praising this film and how it has had a profound effect on them, I feel I must see this movie again for a re-appraisal. What I do remember, before being abducted, was that Fight Club started out so powerfully, I was amazed at the writing. It came out swinging. You knew this wasn't going to be a run-of-the-mill script. Then the story settled into a long drawn out fight after fight sequence that completely turned me off. Not because of the violence. Hey, I'm a Rambo film kinda guy, but just the sheer stupidity of it all. I'm now a bit confused. So many others saw something special in all this that I'm not ready to rate this movie until I force myself to sit through another viewing.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" This film should be compulsory for all psychology students...
",,"It is not often that a film captures Christian America's need to define itself through arbitrary means so well, but Fight Club succeeds admirably. As anyone with a basic understanding of human psychology knows, there are a few basic drives that all humans feel a biological and psychological need to satisfy: food, sleep, and sex. None of these drives can be denied, and Army experiments to see the results of depriving the first two turned up some interesting results. Soldiers placed on low sustenance diets became obsessed with food to the point where they began hanging pictures of food items in their lockers. Soldiers deprived of sleep became obsessed with resting to the point where some attempts to deny them rest resulted in violence.Similarly, it is no coincidence that America is both the most sexually repressed and most overweight nation in the First World. Many young adults in America who are denied an outlet for their sex drive due to religious or societal considerations try to satiate this drive by the arbitrary method of stuffing oneself (no pun intended) with junk food. Fight Club simply took these three observations about how screwed up our society really is and translated them into real-world terms.This, in a nutshell, is the basis of Fight Club. A man who has become the definition of modern homo sapien's need to define itself by arbitrary means meets a man who has found a way to shed those things and bring his life back to a point where it satisfies only the three basic drives of all sentient animals. I experienced this in some form last year during a holiday. I could live without my DVD player and all my toys that I don't really need. What I can't live without is a sense that I am a free man with direct control over the direction of my life.It's amazing that this film works so well, because it is only a series of interactions between three principal characters: Jack, Tyler, and Marla. Everyone else is pretty much inconsequential to the plot, even Bob or Angel Face, in spite of how well they are played. The novel might as well have only had those three characters, in fact, so it is a real credit to the director and screenwriter that the latter two characters make any impression at all. Edward Norton is mesmerising as Jack, playing a role that would tie a lesser actor up in knots, all without skipping so much as a beat. Brad Pitt is excellent, and it looks as if Tyler Durden is a role designed to make us feel that we've finally found something he does well.The real surprise here, however, is Helena Bonham Carter as Marla Singer. This is a character that could have easily dissolved into an insult to all those in our arbitrary society for whom television and digital audio are simply not enough. Instead, Helena brings a depth and sympathy to the character that is completely absent from the story in its written form. Angelina Jolie be damned, Helena was really the most deserving recipient of a best supporting actress award here.If I had to pick any flaws with the film, it's that the story is a major contradiction of real cases of Dissociative Identity Disorder. It is rare for sufferers of DID to have only one alternate who is so similar to them, and don't blast me about that because I know real sufferers of the disorder. Compared to some real alternates I've seen and heard, Tyler and Jack might as well be twin brothers. Another contradiction is that those with DID cannot simply switch into an alternate personality and do what they wouldn't normally do as themselves. Hence, if Jack has moral objections to stealing fat from a liposuction clinic, so too will Tyler.However, these minor plot problems, which are necessary to plot movement anyway, are carried over from the book and are quickly overshadowed by the virtues of the film. All in all, I believe Fight Club is worthy of ten out of ten. One of the best films it has been my pleasure to review on DVD (and I pity anyone who tries to watch it on VHS). A definite ten out of ten film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Very pretentious and loud: We got the message already, Dave and Chuck! Spoilers!
",spoiler,"Norton has a nice, steady job, a wonderful apartment and a bad case of insomnia. All this materialistic riches and he still ain't happy yet. He doesn't really want to go on with this life-style, but what else is there? What's a chap to do? His doctor reacts indifferent to Norton's self-pity and tells him that, if he wants to see people who are really sick, he should visit support groups for men with testicular cancer. He actually does visit one of these groups, even pretends to suffer from the disease as well, and, color me amazed, all the weeping and sobbing have a calming effect on him. The result: ""even baby's don't sleep this good"". But than a suicidal dark-haired woman starts invading the meetings, and, call it a hunch, he just knows she's faking it, too. Hence, he can't 'enjoy' the group anymore, hence, he can't sleep anymore. On a business-trip, he meets cool, but strangely dressed Tyler Durden, who says things Norton really digs and who is actually everything Norton wanted to be, but couldn't. Durden is unhappy with society and a lot of things he has to say about it hit bull's eye, but some of the things he says fall right of the mark, and are horribly shallow, easy quick fix answers. Durden likes to talk a lot, he likes to hear himself talk (something I can relate to) but to a certain extent, he's past the phase of talking and it's time to walk the walk as well. Support groups for people with sometimes terminal diseases? Been there. Done that. Durden thinks it's time to let his fists talk. So he does. And Norton is calmed by it, sleeping like a baby again. And, apparently, a lot of other people are appealed by this way of therapy, too. Fight Club is born.When Norton walks through his apartment, which has become a 3-dimensional IKEA-catalogue, complete with the 'witty names' and prices super-imposed over the furniture, I was reminded of Dutch entertainer Youp van 't Hek, well-known for his critical view of modern society; taking a swipe at IKEA is something this guy does often as well. I liked Fight Club so far, but then Durden asks Norton: ""Hit me"". And from this moment on, I started having problems with this movie. Matter becomes of greater importance than substance. SPOILER ALERT Norton turns out to be the same person as Durden. Norton was a schizo all along. But wait a minute, we saw these two guys interacting and talking in front of other people! Norton isn't a Norman Bates talking with mommy dearest in the basement and hiding his alter ego from the outside world. But it doesn't matter here, because by the time we find out this secret, everything has become larger than life, even more so. The cinematic equivalent of Youp van 't Hek suddenly deciding that the words themselves are suddenly not strong enough anymore. We need loud music. And a light-show. So what if we can't hear what Youp is saying anymore? So what if we are distracted by the visual off-showing? Matter over substance. The point if well made in the first half of the movie, but by then, we have another seventy minutes to sit through. I found myself becoming impatient. In the first half I enjoyed the acting, the nice visual touches (like film-operator Durden inserting a frame of a penis between two reels of a family film), but when things got louder and louder and grander and grander and the film ended with a frame insert of a penis (not merely a subliminal, single frame insert -- I guess because Fincher wanted to be sure the audience couldn't miss it, couldn't miss how witty and great his ideas are), I was tired. Possibly, no, HOPEFULLY the gradual 'larger than life' look and content of this film are meant to reflect the fact that the Fight Club is going too far, is going crazy, has become unrealistic about it goals and the means to achieve them. If not, I really DID see a shallow film full of errors and psychological mistakes about bare-breasted, bare knuckled men having found a so-called philosophical, intellectual excuse (supported by the necessary sarcastic humor) to beat the crap out of each other. Either way, I found myself rapidly growing tired of this film.For some people this is a subversive film, a cry for things to change, but I like to believe that this is actually a film about tolerance. Be free, do what you want to do, believe who or what you want, but don't shove your opinion through other people's throats. If many people are happy with a certain way of life, if people are happy with not much more than dead end jobs and watching television all night long, let them. They are not ready for something else at the moment -- maybe they'll never be in this life. Force them to live life to the max, to change their lives and you have...sheep once again (just like the members of Fight Club gradually become again). You have the choice not to go on with a dead-end job, not to eat at MacDonalds, not to shop at IKEA, not to drink coffee at Starbucks. Hey, I don't either (drinking at Starbucks would be hard, by the way, because there aren't any branches in Holland), but I'm not judging people who do. Like Michael Jackson once said: ""Start with the man in the mirror"". That may be a corny phrase, but it's really the most important thing you can do. And, in a lot of cases, the ONLY thing you can do. Don't feel superior to other people (like a lot of pro-Fight Club reviewers on these pages do). Feeling superior, having the urge to change things fast and use a 'quick fix' to 'open other people's eyes' can make things get out of hand pretty fast, as shown in this film and by its surrealistic, chaotic visual style. Definitely not a masterpiece, but not a complete failure either with great acting and cool music to boost.*** out of ****",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Young men getting angry at consumerist society?
",,"This is an interesting film - the violence appears more a side issue to the really acid take ""Fight Club"" has on society. Then again, the violence is why quite a few people went to see it. If they went for straight out gore though, the hopefully left considering more interesting issues.I thoroughly disagree with those who state this is an irresponsible pion to Nazism... heavy-handed, sure (black shirts and soap) but, I don't see why it was particularly at fault: after all it drips cynicism and just cannot be read as a straight ahead film. I don't think it was saying men are defined only by aggression, rather that - men can easily be defined only by aggression. I particularly liked the creeping madness infecting the men of America - the idea of a surreal, out of control secret society. The lead two, Pitt and Norton, are great... unhinged, and repressed respectively.Helena Bonham-Carter is actually really good too(in a fairly slight role) as a rather dysfunctional love interest. I thought it quite a thoughtful film (if you reference Emerson, you automatically get a brownie point from me!) The incredibly eye-catching/hyper real visuals added to a sense of subverted reality. It does rather seem to be a film of two (long!) halves - the first rather more spiteful and sharp, the second violent and surreal.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" I was impressed
",,"Definitely one of the great movies of 1999, a worthy flick to end the decade that has given the world such classics as Pulp Fiction, Bad Lieutenant and stuff by the great Asian directors John Woo and Takeshi Kitano.Fight Club is near to visual perfection, walking in the footsteps of Fincher's previous masterpiece, Seven, but surpassed, though, by The Matrix. It is violent, venomous and ... hilarious.It is advisable not to eat too much before going to see it, because at least one scene with Pitt, Norton and the bag of raw material for soap made me feel quite a bit of nausea. And it's VERY hard to make me feel nausea...The icing on the cake for me was Pixies' ""Where Is My Mind"" at the end of it all. A perfect way to end a perfect movie.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

" Worst movie ever (may contain spoiler...depending on who you are)
",spoiler,"I, for one, hated this movie...I only saw it once and it was a long time ago, so forgive any incorrect references. Personally, I don't know if I saw it again now if my opinion would be different...maybe, but somehow I doubt it.The beginning was interesting enough to entertain me...specifically the whole him going to different group session things as a hobby and then meeting Marla who does the same thing. That's interesting.I think the whole thing started to bore me about when the movie started going nowhere, from what I remember, it was just Marla living there, and Brad Pitt beating the crap out of Edward Norton every night or whatever. It just lost its interest.The end was a cool twist, the whole Tyler thing...it was interesting, but the film as a whole I don't think was just very well presented. Maybe if I'd read the book it'd make more sense.I just think I didn't like it because it didn't make sense to me. I understand this makes me a bit of an outcast because everyone loves Fight Club, but I apologize...just not my taste. If anyone wants to just explain a few key points out for me, or something, that'd be great.Just please don't rip me a new one, because I understand I am like, the ONLY one who doesn't like that movie.""SLIDE!""",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Hated it
",spoiler,"I suppose the character development was good, and the acting was also good, but this movie had no entertainment value at all. Unlike most people who review movies on here, I don't try to be a critic,pick things apart looking for holes in the plot, and look for some profound meaning. I don't need Hollywood trying to influence my thinking about anything. This was not a chick flick or an action movie that most average guys would watch. I don't know what it was. I get the whole modern man hamster wheel thing where we are utterly spending ourselves trying to acquire the things that corporations advertise and convince us that we need, but we really don't need at all. But the fighting thing for fun and release? Just stupid. I guess some viewers think that they are more intelligent than the rest of us and are able to grasp the deeper meaning, and thus become more enlightened, but if your like me and just love good stories and being entertained, don't watch this show.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Quite an accomplishment
",,"Brad Pitt and Edward Norton are in the ""Fight Club,"" a 1999 film directed by David Fincher and written by Jim Uhls. The movie also stars Helena Bonham Carter, Meat Loaf, and Zach Grenier.Edward Norton is Jack, the Narrator of the film (though there is some controversy over his name). Tired of his job, his life, and his boss, he finds great satisfaction by attending group sessions for alcoholics, drug addicts,compulsive gamblers, compulsive eaters, cancer victims, etc. He soon encounters another group groupie, the bizarre Marla Singer (Carter), and realizes that when she's in a group with him, he has no release of his feelings. So the two make a deal and split up the meetings and the nights they attend.When Jack returns from a trip, his apartment is in flames. With nowhere to go, he calls a man he met on the plane, Tyler Durden, and goes to live with him in an old, decrepit, filthy house. The two soon become involved in forming an underground Fight Club, where Jack finds the release he seeks, learns who he is as a man, and develops assertiveness and courage.Okay, like ""Mulholland Drive,"" that's the story on the surface, but the film isn't really about what was described above. It's a complicated, dark, violent story about tearing down superficial values, ripping into rampant consumerism, and really feeling and living instead of existing.""Fight Club"" starts off as quite funny, actually, with Jack and Marla arguing over who's going to the prostate cancer meeting, and becomes progressively darker, stranger, and faster as it races to a surprising ending. Unfortunately for me, it took me too long to see the film, so the ending wasn't such a surprise. I would have loved to experience the full impact of it.The performances from Norton, Pitt, and Carter are fabulous. All three are shown to their absolute best advantage. Norton for some reason is always a little underrated. He does a beautiful job. Carter years ago made a seamless transition from ingénue to leading lady, and this, like Mrs. Lovett in Sweeney Todd, is more of a character role.""Fight Club"" is horrific to watch in parts because of the violence, but it's worth getting through it to see a truly masterful film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" In this other world, everything is not at all otherworldly, but darkly starkly breathtaking...
",,"Fight Club (1999)Such an inventive, twisting, intelligent, seamless movie you'll rarely rarely find. If you want logic or sunshine, forget about it. If you don't mind diving down, getting lost, gasping, and shaking your head in appreciative amazement, this is your movie. Any number of things could go wrong when you have so much depending on the two main male characters each presenting a psychology meant to be a yin and yang pairing, but nothing goes wrong here. Brad Pitt is confident, virile, beautiful in every way that Edward Norton is not. When they meet, so to speak, Norton is transformed, and the wild events that follow seem vaguely possible, even if patently impossible. It's a crazy ride and a beautiful one, dark and funny, and even a little romantic (the woman sidekick is played to perfection by Helena Bonham Carter). Chuck Palahniuk's novel is the basis for all this inventive insanity, and you give director David Fincher credit for even thinking it was filmable. It was a huge effort in every way--assembling the cast, arranging all the special effects, creating the dark and drained color palette, working in the spasmodic soundtrack (effects and music both), on and on. Not to mention just editing it so that it made sense. Which it does. Fincher is a music video director at heart, and that feel is not lost here, to his benefit (the two other films of his I've seen are also visually athletic, the archetypally atmospheric Se7en and the more straight up Panic Room).Fight Club has to be seen for what it is. When I first saw it a year ago, finally, it struck me as trying too hard, and a little outlandish, I mean, it's all so improbable, life on steroids and with sunglasses on in the dark. But this time all this craziness was exactly right, and within the film, within the rules of this special universe inside the film itself, it isn't crazy at all, but convincing and gut level perfect. Step away and don't look back. Perfect stuff.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" awesome, subversive film-making at it's best!
",,"pretty much a perfect film.smart script. creative direction. spot on performances. i love movies that are as good or better the second time around, and fight club is definitely one of them. the twist is awesome and the ending is great too. i really love how much it says about capitalism and our need to consume, how we live, and what makes a person human.plus it's just one clever and beautiful scene after another.if you liked being john malkovich, snatch, and the usual suspects, you will dig this too.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" A Cult Film, lacking universal appeal....
",,"David Fincher's screen adaptation of the 1996 novel of the same name by Chuck Palahniuk, 'Fight Club' was a box office debacle when released, but has gained a cult following over the years. In my opinion, this 'zany' film caters to a niche audience.'Fight Club' is weird & abstract. Not every cine-lover will understand what's going on, especially the climax, which is very confusing. Honestly, Some films are meant to be made & 'Fight Club' is one of those films. It doesn't matter who praises or hates it, it's just there.Fincher is a accomplished genius of a filmmaker. His body of work is simply remarkable. I am fan, indeed! Jeff Cronenweth's Cinematography stands out. Acting wise, Edward Norton steals the show with a winning performance. This is amongst his finest works. Helena Bonham Carter is fantastic, as always. Brad Pitt's performance has potential.On the whole 'Fight Club' is undoubtedly the wackiest novel-turned-into a film. Reccmended to all!",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Highly overrated!
",,"""Fight Club"" is a film that everyone talks about, either because they love it or they despise it. My impression of this psychological, violent thriller is of the latter, I'm afraid. The film starts out tremendously, as a small, absolute excitement focused on Edward Norton's character and this works perfectly until it reaches the middle. Here, the film starts downhill when it shifts its point of view from Norton exclusively to the now largely extended Fight Club. And eventually it hits rock bottom at its end. Here it completely betrays itself by neglecting the very exciting, minor psychological story of Norton's character and completely going all in on visual-effects, action-packed sequences and Helena Bonham-Carter's character, whose role until this minute has played no important part in events. It literally develops a sort of cinematic delusions of grandeur, and this does NOT suit the film at all! I'm afraid ""Fight Club"" is not as good as everyone says. Maybe as the Sunday-afternoon- rainy day fun it works, but as a film so critically acclaimed and loved, it disappoints and neglects. The acting is NOT that impressive, the story is well written, but NOT a masterpiece and the ending has plot-holes as big as its megalomania. To sum up, I honestly cannot comprehend why ""Fight Club"" is seeded as the 21st best motion picture of all times on IMDb's Top 250-list. I can't help thinking what marvels and jewels have been ignored in order for this movie to have its undeserved glory  and what a shame that is.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" One of the best movies ever made?
",,"The first time I saw Fight Club, I didn't really take it in - I was tired and bored and not in the mood for a dark and depressing film like this. We turned it off halfway through, after about 90 minutes of not paying attention. What a mistake that was.I watched it again several months later when it was being shown on TV. Being only 13, I failed somewhat to absorb the deeper themes and concepts of the film but was highly, highly entertained by the Joe Everyman tale of a person so bored, unhappy and in the need of change in their life (it reminded me very, very much of American Beauty in this regard).Three years on, I watched it for the third time and it absolutely blew me away. Pretty much everything about it is perfect - plot, acting, direction, music - it all combined into a single perfect narrative package.Where do I start? The acting is out of this world. I can't claim to have seen many of Edward Norton's movies (in fact, only this and American History X), but his performance here was brilliant as the aforementioned Joe Everyman who also provides excellent, often deadpan narration that not only propels the story but is entertaining and even funny, a rare feat. As for Brad Pitt, until I saw Fight Club I had dismissed him as another pretty-boy, somewhat-talented actor more suited to romantic comedies than dark dramas. How wrong I was. His acting abilities are in full flight as the suave and confident antagonist of the story, Tyler Durden. Helena Bonham Carter is also great as usual, playing the leading lady (of sorts), Marla Singer.Or the story, based on the book by Chuck Palahniuk. While it essentially retains a simple three-act plot, it constantly twists and turns as to never let the viewer remove their eyes from the screen for even a second. This is NOT a movie about fighting. The overwhelming theme of the film is of anti-consumerism and challenging the values systems that have been put in place through advertising. The fighting itself serves as a way for the characters to escape from their repetitive, depressing, boring and most importantly sterile lives and experience feeling that the material objects deemed so important by their values system cannot give them.Director David Fincher produces one of the finest directorial efforts of recent times. The mise-en-scene he generates is terrific - harsh, sterile, postmodern - and there are several scenes that showcase his mastery of some unusual camera techniques. His directing here is strange in the best possible way. One particular short fantasy scene on a plane especially stands out.Fincher was concerned that traditional film music bands wouldn't be able to tie all the film's themes together, so he recruited the Dust Brothers, an electronica duo who had never recorded for a movie before. What a contribution they make. The score is postmodern, sterile, and artificial-sounding, perfectly in keeping with the ideas in the film. It also manages to create a mood without usually being noticeable, a difficult trick to pull off correctly.While loved and hated by equal numbers of critics, Fight Club is undeniably one of the greatest films for many years, probably the best of the 90's. Go and see it - you won't regret the experience, even if you don't think it's 'your kind' of film.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" one of the best ever
",,"i think this is one the greatest movie ever made, a great insight into the male psychology. therefore if a wife or girlfriend feel uneasy about her understandings of her boyfriend/husband, this feature might very well help with exactly that, and i am not referring to ""special"" cases that are called as such simply because those are not ""general"" ones. on second plan, this has great take as well , on the social-political landscape present, especially in the ""western society"" that is very rarely debated in a very realistic, yet well stylized and with a ""cool"" artistically make-up form, and for everyones comprehension at various perception levels. this feature will probably affect your unconsciousness more then anything else, will make you have emotions coming from deep down inside and not ""formalistic"" or suggested ones. a very important fact to mentions as well is that this production has been made prior to September 11, 2001 events and when re-watching ( for those like myself that have seen it ""before"" and ""after"") one could see certain aspects that makes the plot even stronger then it was originally designed to be. or who knows, maybe the conspiracy theories do have at least a logical base. also, for those not interested much in the above statements, this movie delivers a great suspense story, the least to say. from my observation this feature has been well talked about, at least from this last mentioned aspect, and probably not many reading this are unfamiliar with the story line.in a nutshell, if you have liked ""the usual suspects"" you will love this one. and if you have already loved it, then you will likely watch it yet again for extra details or mood definer.WARNING: If you are reading this then this warning is for you. Every word you read of this useless fine print is another second off your life. Don't you have other things to do? Is your life so empty that you honestly can't think of a better way to spend these moments? Or are you so impressed with authority that you give respect and credence to all that claim it? Do you read everything you're supposed to read? Do you think every thing you're supposed to think? Buy what you're told to want? Get out of your apartment. Meet a member of the opposite sex. Stop the excessive shopping and masturbation. Quit your job. Start a fight. Prove you're alive. If you don't claim your humanity you will become a statistic. You have been warned- Tyler. (end quote). maybe you need more to be convinced...""Man, I see in fight club the strongest and smartest men who've ever lived. I see all this potential, and I see squandering. God damn it, an entire generation pumping gas, waiting tables; slaves with white collars. Advertising has us chasing cars and clothes, working jobs we hate so we can buy s--t we don't need. We're the middle children of history, man. No purpose or place. We have no Great War. No Great Depression. Our Great War's a spiritual war... our Great Depression is our lives. We've all been raised on television to believe that one day we'd all be millionaires, and movie gods, and rock stars. But we won't. And we're slowly learning that fact.

" It is impossible not to break the first and second rules of Fight Club...
",,"...Which are both 'you do not talk about Fight Club' I first watched this film about 3 or 4 years ago and it has been my favourite movie ever since and has made Edward Norton one of my favourite actors.It's not only the clever dialogue, perfect casting and amazing acting that makes this film my favourite but also the small details that director David Fincher adds to make it an immaculate and flawless film. I will always wonder why Brad Pitt and Edward Norton were not even nominated for Oscars when films like Monster's Ball and Shakespeare In Love won best actress Oscars for Halle Berry and Gwyneth Paltrow who were lousy compared to Pitt and Norton but i can guarantee that anyone who sees this film no matter how old they are will not be disappointed.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
" Way off the mark
",spoiler,"This film certainly has its share of fanfare and hype. I really was hoping I would like it even though the trailer didn't impress me. Well, it turned out being worse than I thought. Meanwhile, Fincher continues to get worse with each effort. The only reason I didn't rank this as 1 was on account of the brilliant Ed Norton. Pitt just plays himself the same way he usually does. The violence gets really old quickly and so does the film. This was way too long and pretentious. Fincher has some interesting points with all the IKEA furniture bits. Perhaps it would have been better in an hour TV show like Ray Bradburyesque. About the only amusing scene in the last half of the film was when Norton is beating the crap out of himself in his boss's office. Of course I liked this scene best when Jim Carrey did it in Liar Liar. Fincher obviously thought he was doing something important here with his pop culture references. I suppose I'm not so easily impressed because I don't rely on American mainstream movies for entertainment. Ooops..sorry to burst your bubbles but despite what some people think, Fincher is not God. After Aliens3 he struck gold with the thrilling ""Se7en"" and followed that with the mediocrity of ""The Game"" only to follow that with this rubbish. Then he went off the radar completely after the embarrassing ""Panic Room"". Not even Jodie Foster or Forrest Whitaker could breathe life into that sleep fest. The twist at the end of FC may have worked better if the darn film didn't drag on for another half hour. Then cue the Pixies song to show that we're cool....puke.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
