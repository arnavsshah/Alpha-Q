" Fantastic.
",,"I won't say it's an underrated movie, but it has somewhat been buried by the legacy of other ""popular"" Nolan movies. With this movie, Nolan shows his ability to make a metacinematic film, yet again. This is obviously my most favorite Christopher Nolan movie, along with ""Memento"" (2000). Just like you can relate the theme of memories and interpretations shown in the story of ""Memento"" with the actual experience we had while watching the movie, we can relate the three acts of a magic trick narrated within the story with the movie itself. As the movie says, the final reveal in a magic trick is the most thrilling experience. So is that of this movie. In fact, the whole movie can be weirdly related to a magic trick. It is one of those movies which feel quite ordinary until a major twist makes it great. Speaking of the cinematic experience, it is a typical Nolan styled movie. It has broken timelines to enhance the storytelling, but unlike in most of his movies these are done more artistically than just for the thrilling reveal. This is perhaps the movie where Nolan's broken timelines have enhanced the storytelling in the most brilliant way. Like in most of movies, he dwells in a single theme - here it's obsession. The obsession of Robert Angier is what drives the plot of the movie, and is well established and doesn't even feel forced. There is a protagonist, and an antagonist in this movie. The character development is done so smoothly that we see the protagonist become an antagonist, while the antagonist remains somewhat the same. Though we don't get a full ""interchange"" between the antagonist and the protagonist, as the movie progresses, the protagonist feels more ""wrong"" than the antagonist. That's quite a difficult thing that it pulls off. Alfred Bordon is one of the most ""complex"" characters I have ever seen. He feels like some kind of a prick throughout the movie, and there are a lot of scenes to establish it for the viewers. That's until we get to know his character in the third act. It doesn't make him right for his wrong doings, but he gets the respect for his dedication as a magician. The whole Tesla plotline might feel like a convenient plot device, but Tesla is a scientist who is rumoured to travel through time. So, that is quite justifiable. Hugh Jackman has given a solid performance. This must go down as his best performances with those of ""Prisoners"" (2013) and ""Logan"" (2017). He is completely out of his public persona of Wolverine. He is the best possible choice for Wolverine imo, but reminder of Wolverine every time he appears on screen isn't so adorable. He didn't remind me of Wolverine at all, in this movie. But, the major highlight of the movie would be Christian Bale. He has given a terrific performance. You don't even get a hint at the complexity of the character he is portraying. It's after the reveal and in fact, in the second viewing that you start noticing the actual stuffs and the actual interpretations a particular scene is to be given. All in all, it's a fantastic movie. The way obsession play out to be the main theme, the way broken timelines are used for storytelling and the way the final twist is revealed - simply excellent. It gets a special ""10/10"" and an ""A+""."
" A Stylish, Uniquely Twisted Period Piece
",spoiler,"What ""The Prestige"" does very well is recreate a period of show business history near the turn of the century in which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The workings of the complicated illusions are gorgeously brought to life via smartly detailed apparatus that replicate the actual mechanics of Victorian legerdemain. Much of the film rings very true, such as the all-consuming obsessions of the lead characters to be the best and outdo all others. It's an easy step to accept that such unwavering determination spills over into deadly territory, as rival magicians suave Rupert Angier (a riveting performance by Hugh Jackman) and audacious Alfred Borden (Christian Bale effortlessly playing a brooding lower-class Brit) each seek to wreak continuing revenge upon the other.The story, though adapted from a novel, feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities, as the machinations of the two men become increasingly convoluted during a back-and-forth tug of wits that keeps you guessing in the style of Nolan's ""Memento."" As the game grows increasingly deadly, and threatens to consume all they love, the film becomes a fascinating study in single-mindedness.The work is epic in sweep, beautifully filmed, and strongly acted. The only odd note in casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla (he looks nothing like the actual Tesla, if you care about these sort of things, and his appearance calls attention to itself as superstar casting often does), but Mr. Bowie holds his own. Solid performances are all around, with Michael Caine adding dignity and depth as the old master, Scarlett Johanssen as the as the lovely stage assistant who becomes the third point in a twisted love triangle, and even Andy Serkis (Gollum!) in a memorable supporting role.The introduction of Tesla adds yet another twist, as the film shifts from real-but-possible stage illusion to steam-punkish sci-fi. This transition is a hard note to pull off, since the beginning of the film doesn't quite suggest such a direction, but if you're willing to let Nolan lead you on the journey into increasingly fantastic realms, the narrative rewards you with thought-provoking moral and dramatic exploration of the issues raised.A truly entertaining movie, and an original, unusual, dark ride -- well worth seeing in a theater for its grand scope and vision."
" Are you watching closely?
",spoiler,"The Prestige, adapted from an award winning novel of the same name by Christopher Priest, is an intricate tale of passion, intrigue, deceit and obsession about two illusionists, whose morbid covetousness for absolute supremacy in their profession engenders a fierce rivalry that turns internecine and ultimately consumes them. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) at the start of their careers are highly ambitious young men assisting an elderly illusionist named Milton. Borden's incessant longing for innovation leads to the accidental death of Angier's wife. Borden marries Sarah and his apparent happiness further aggravates the sense of revulsion in Angier's heart. Angier's vindictive intervention during a bullet catch trick causes Borden to lose his two fingers. Though these events sowed the seeds of implacable hatred, but it is the unremitting yearning of their perpetually insatiable egos to outperform each other that eventually drives them to perdition.Angier starts performing with the sobriquet ""The Great Danton"" with Cutter (Michael Caine) as his illusion engineer, while Borden with the stage name ""The Professor"" with Fellon as his engineer. Angier is an adept showman, but lacks the technical prowess. On the contrary, Borden is highly skillful, but lacks the taste for grandeur and showmanship. Each regards the other as his only obstacle (owing to their bitterly intertwined past) and this starts a series of events in which each tries to stymie the other by any means possible (sabotage, abduction, incrimination and even killings). Awed by the apparent genuineness of Borden's version of ""The Transported Man"" and inveigled by Borden's deliberate misdirection, Angier travels miles and spends a fortune to approach an ingenious scientist named Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) in order to cajole him into building a machine for him (a machine that could help him outperform Borden). Nikola Tesla is an apostle of Alternating Current (and rightly thinks it to be superior to Direct Current), and is under immense pressure imparted by Thomas Edison (ruthless advocator of Direct Current) and his men, who are after Tesla. As Edison's men close in on him, Tesla runs out of time and hence funds for his research and is forced to oblige Angier, who is his very last client. Tesla flees the scene shortly after fulfilling his promise to Angier (not without leaving him a strong note of caution against the use of his invention), whose ever increasing skepticism in Tesla is placated by the efficacy of his masterful invention. Using Tesla's machine, Angier introduces his own version of ""The Transported Man"", which becomes an instant success, but in lieu of a terrible self-sacrifice (that Angier has to make every night while performing). As the story culminates, the viewer is startled with many revelations including the mental and physical torments that Borden's complex character undergoes owing to his total devotion towards his art.The success of an act of illusion solely depends upon the deftness with which its three parts viz. the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige are performed. Similarly, for a movie to be a success, its three main aspects i.e. screenplay, direction, and acting are ought to be top-notch. Christopher Nolan incredibly manages to strike all the right cords with The Prestige. His riveting maneuvers coupled with his ingenious auteur skills aggrandize the brilliance of the movie ten-fold. Nolan succeeds in having a dream assemblage of actors with almost everyone giving a memorable performance. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are superb in their lead roles. Michael Caine shines in his low-key portrayal of Cutter, an ordinary part made to appear extraordinary through sheer brilliance; vintage Caine. David Bowie as Nikola Tesla and Andy Serkis (Gollum of LOTR) as Alley (Tesla's assistant) are stupendous in their cameos. Scarlet Johansson also manages to give a scintillating portrayal as Borden's paramour, Olivia.The movie is a roller-coaster of a ride with intriguingly intertwined subplots and masterful time switching, which makes it one of a kind and an ultimate masterpiece. The uncanny feat of Nolan to manifest a motion picture, which forays the realms of Mystery, Thrill, Sci-fi and Fantasy, is truly exemplary and makes the movie a contemporary classic. The movie is a tapestry of twists and turns, which evinces its overwhelming potential to bewitch the masses and satiate even the most esoteric viewers. The questions that it incessantly asks of the viewers can only be answered after repetitive viewings, with each viewing seeking utmost attention of the viewer. The only question that I would ask of the viewer is: ""Are you watching closely?"" A must watch for anyone, who has nothing against giving his mind a rigorous exercise and his body an adrenaline rush. 10/10"
" Storytelling at its best!
",,"The Prestige is a masterful exercise in storytelling with superb direction and powerful performances by a grand ensemble cast. From set and production design to cinematography, from script to presentation, Christopher Nolan has once again demonstrated why he is one of the film world's brightest up and coming directors. The Prestige only helps solidify his standing as one of the landmark directors of his generation.Told in a narrative that jumps between various points along its time line, playing out like a magic act itself, the story is that of two magicians on the rise in their careers. The first -- played by Christian Bale -- is an expert in understanding the fundamentals of any trick, but lacks showmanship. The second -- played by Hugh Jackman -- is a master showman who is more entertaining than technical. A tragic series of events pits the two performers against each other in a battle of wits that spirals further and further out of control, consuming both of them and everything and everyone they care about.With a story that requires actors with a great deal of emotive range, Nolan has assembled what could be described as a dream cast. Both Bale and Jackman suit their respective roles perfectly, and pitting these two performers against each other was a stroke of casting genius. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role by any lesser actor and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie whose unforgettable turn as master physicist Nikola Tesla absolutely shines. Add Andy Serkis to the mix, and what is assembled is a group of performers who know how to fully engage the audience.The Prestige is hard to pigeonhole into any specific genre as it walks the fine line between mystery, drama, suspense and fantasy. In that, the story becomes a never-ending stream of wonder for the mind: one can never tell exactly where the story is going to lead next, becoming more and more as time goes on. This gives Christopher Nolan ample opportunity to play. And play he does. With narration by several characters, each adding their own viewpoint to the events, and with a direction that moves between time to mystify and distract, the end result is a climax that itself is a series of puzzles that each unravel beautifully.The only major criticisms that can be leveled at the Prestige are a confusing play with the seasons during Tesla's introduction (winter suddenly becomes spring/summer and back again) and a strange choice of music for the closing credits (a pop song at the end of a film such as this seems tacky). However, neither is significant enough of a problem to warrant any need to avoid the film at all.In the end, the Prestige is a fantastic display of what can be accomplished when you bring together superior talent. It is certainly worth the price of admission and as good as any magic show you are to come across."
" This movie fills the screen and your mind.
",spoiler,"I couldn't help myself. I just kept saying ""wow, what a beautifully crafted film,"" all the way home, and around my house when I arrived home. I have not been so captured and entertained in a long time. I was especially enamored with the screen writing and how tightly and beautifully the visual metaphors tied in with the writing, and with the impact of the human message about obsession, competition and retribution carried to the extreme. One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale, as the two magicians could easily be symbolic of how leaders of countries come to blows with each other, at the expense of their women and children -- something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time.Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Sir Michael Caine all contributed stunning, emotional performances. Rebecca Hall, who played Sarah to Bale's Alfred Borden, turned in a highly charged performance as well, making Scarlett Johansson's Olivia flat in comparison. And although some people thought the plot line a bit tedious, I found it to be refreshingly complex and engaging, while not being so complex as to lose you. If you can't follow this one, you've been watching television too long. And who cares if the illusions are mundane or scientifically unbelievable? Isn't that what both movies and illusions ask us to do? To suspend disbelief? Meantime, there's a message in its madness. Hello.The film is visually moody and evocative, easily transporting you into the time period. What more could you ask for? A film is a visual medium and this one is a visual ten. The acting is superb as well as the plot. It keeps you interested; it keeps you guessing right to the shocking but most appropriate end.It asks you, what is one willing to sacrifice for the ""prestige?""I think this one's an Oscar definite."
" A Nutshell Review: The Prestige
",,"I've said it before, but I'll say it again. Christopher Nolan can do no  wrong.  Teaming up again with his Batman Begins cast of Christian Bale and  Michael Caine, and joined with the Scoop team consisting of X-Men's  Wolverinie Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson, the stellar (eye candy)  cast already set tongues wagging as to whether they'll be able to live  up to the hype of Nolan's long awaited movie directly challenging the  other picture about Victorian magicians, The Illusionist.  The Prestige is the third act of any magic trick, with the first and  second acts being the Pledge and the Turn. And this movie lives up to  its namesake to a T. The way the movie plays out, it's like a huge  magic trick, with the audience waiting to see how it unfolds, getting  the suspicion on how it's done, but yet sitting through it thorough  engaged to discover how everything will be revealed and resolved. It  tells the story of how two magicians, fellow apprentices turned  unfortunate rivals, plod down the slow path of jealous obsession,  revenge, and the deliberate attempts to go at lengths to steal each  other's ideas, to go one up against the other, a fight in romance, life  and the long held passionate drive to discredit each other. There are  perfect explanations of the value of secrets, and how secrets can  sometimes be used as tools for deceit.  What I thought was valuable in the movie was the reinforcement of the  notion of how ""magic"" actually worked. Besides the better understanding  of the common body of scientific knowledge, things like having pretty  assistants to distract, and having planted staff amongst the audience,  somehow made me a sceptic to tricks and illusions, and try harder to  spot at which stage had things undergone a sleight of hand. More  importantly, it introduced me to the notion and importance of a loyal  engineer behind the scenes who designs elaborate contraptions solely  for the magician's use, and how having disloyal staff can indeed be  detrimental to any leaks of secrets.  And Michael Caine took on this engineering role as Cutter, responsible  for assisting Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) with loyalty and conviction  that they could, as a team, beat Christian Bale's Alfred Borden. I  thought the cast in general were superb, with Christian Bale leading  the charge. Hugh Jackman too showed that he could play a dark  character, as the two leads tackled their characters' theme of  sacrifice, arrogance, and ultimately redemption, especially for Rupert  Angier. I thought he did what he did towards the end was a kind of  penance to what happened in the beginning, hoping to kill two birds  with a single stone, to exact the sweetest revenge he could possibly  muster. What also was intriguing about the two lead characters was that  there is no right or wrong, no hero or villain. It's always a shade of  grey in what they do, and for Alfred Borden, I felt it's more for  survival and the provision for family, which is a strong subplot  running through the film. I just have to mention though, that Scarlett  Johansson being Esquire's Sexiest Woman Alive, gets to play a flower  vase role here as a magician's assistant, though her role as the pawn  between the rivals added a little gravitas.  The atmosphere was set up great, and so were the costumes and sets. The  soundtrack was hauntingly mesmerizing, capturing the look and mood  appropriately. Look out too for David Bowie's appearance as a Serbian  scientist!   I was floored by the deftness of how Nolan weaved and juxtaposed the  non linear narrative so flawlessly. While the usual techniques is to  use placeholders, or flashback sequences, colours etc, here, time is so  fluid, but yet the audience will know precisely which era they're in,  without being explicitly told, or working too much of the noodle. You  just know, and it's just that feeling of being totally transparent with  time. Even though the movie clocked in at slightly more than 2 hours,  you don't feel its length at all.  At the end of the movie, one quote popped into mind: Misdirection -  what the eyes see and the ears hear, the mind believes. Quite apt to  describe how things work out during the movie, or to describe in  general, Nolan 's films so far. That added richness to lift the movie  to a superior plane. Do yourself a favour, if there's one movie you  absolutely must watch this week, then Prestige must be your natural  choice. It's smart in delivery and slick in presentation. There is none  other.  P.S. Is it just me, or are notebooks a common feature in Nolan's  movies?"
" Outstanding acting performances worth price of admission
",,"I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to  my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year  so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they  would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh  Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in  a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a  little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film  and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the  way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for  some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as  soon as you can, you will not be disappointed."
" Prestigious
",,"The Prestige. I am impressed. I am a HUGE fan of Hugh Jackman and bought the book as soon as I heard he would be in this movie. I read it and enjoyed it, but wasn't especially fond of it. But I still had been really looking forward to this movie.I went to the first showing opening day (Friday, Oct. 20th) with 2 friends and sat a row behind them, alone, to enjoy it peacefully. I loved it all.Christopher Nolan really has a gift at directing. The way the movie cuts back and forth between different places and times is clever. Although some might be confused or left stupefied, others will be happy and glorified. The movie will keep you guessing the whole time until the very end. The script, acting, settings, props, everything was so well-done.Hugh Jackman was excellent as the angry, obsessive magician trying to gain back his life by revenge. Christian Bale was equally impressive as the mystifying, secretive showman, never letting out his secrets until necessary. Michael Caine rocked in supporting everyone else's parts with his curiosity. The rest of the cast rounded out nicely and helped out where need be. I really recommend this movie to a sophisticated audience who doesn't mind a long, mysterious movie.And man, what an ending."
" Amazing! twist after twist!
",,"I have to say this is one of the best movies i have seen this year, i was not expecting it to be that good. There's twist after twist, and when you think there is no more, there will be. Great performances and ever better plot. I highly recommend this movie to all ages.New idea for a movie, and they succeeded it at it greatly. It will have you thinking every time you see a magician on TV!i had to give this movie a 10/10, and i only have 4 movies that i would rate that way in my life time. If there is anything you do this year, make it a trip to watch this movie!I hope you enjoy it as much as i did."
" Just As Intriguing The Second Time, Too!
",,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind-boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!"
" Webby meshwork of magic and mystery
",,"Director Christopher Nolan has a proclivity for warped narratives (Memento) and in The Prestige he serves up a deliciously twisty tale, puffed full of magic theatricality and inventive cinematic devices. With his remarkably sleight-of-hand direction, he spins the tale of two rivaling magicians in Victorian-era London, creating a cerebrally stimulating 2 hour long mise-en-scene in which the audience is literally left guessing and gasping at its rare uniqueness through magic acts and bitter behind-the-stage intrigue.The final pay-off of any magic act  the prestige  is of the essence, and preluding it is the pledge, followed by the turn. Together these three key components are slotted in unique positions in 'The Prestige's arrestingly clever script but it is the titular act that propels the film. The pledge introduces our main characters: magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in turn-of-the-century London and we see how their friendship abruptly becomes a fully-fledged rivalry and hostility with a magic act gone horribly wrong in front of an audience. There is a death, and it lights the fuse of an onslaught of reel revelations and the one-upmanship that will ensue between the two competitors. 'The turn' comes to offers twists by the bucketload in the form of love-interests, and technologically marvelous magic acts. I gasped, I scratched my head, I watched on in awe. No description will do it justice.The prestige as the end note to the show  in which, for example, the disappearer reappears to the deafening applause of the crowd  is so meticulously composed in the film through foreshadowing and fractured chronology that rigorously intersects, intertwines, intercuts, fast-forwards, rewinds and replays key parts of the story that the whole spectacle floors you. Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan have worked out a template script that is more twisty and turny than a mountain road and for that reason I am very reluctant to spoil even the slightest detail of the story of 'The Prestige' of all of its acts, in fact. If you are shaking your head thinking a clever twist ending does not make the movie (and I agree), know that this is not a ""gotcha""-kind of Shyamalan trick where you want to stop the film, rewind it and watch it meticulous foreshadowing up to the cheap pay-off, but a tightly-written ever-shifting hall of mirrors with so many intrinsic twists that on your way home you will still be scratching you head and searching for clues.Our two magicians are perfectly-cast with Hugh Jackman capturing the showy, slick, ambition-driven nature of his character Angier in contrast to Bale's technique-driven purist who may be well on his way to perfecting the craft, but lacks the 'Abracadabra' entertainment value. I had always crowned the latter the more capable actor of the two, but the fact is that Jackman performs just as well in the film. Having said that, Borden has more layers to his complex, contradictory (keyword) persona than the flashy, greedy Angier which perhaps begs more weight from the actor behind the role, shifting more demand on Christian Bale. The sad fact of it is that neither of these two men are likable characters and elicit nothing more than temporary sympathy. However, the secrecy with which the intricate story approaches them makes it impossible for the viewer to slot them in protagonist vs. antagonist positions, and indeed they are given almost the exact same screen-time and voice-over narration throughout, a subtle and brilliant accolade of Nolan's.To further evaluate the cast of The Prestige, David Bowie and Michael Caine undoubtedly merit a great deal of praise for supporting the two moody, unlikeable leading men. It is a crying shame then that Scarlett Johansson  always an incapable actress except for the rare occasions in which she plays a sultry American vixen (Match Point)  performs so badly in the role of Olivia Wenscombe, a magic assistant pending between Borden and Angier. Here she is actually given a very good and important character who is not necessarily bad like the rest, but botches her interpretation by giving an unspeakably hammy London accent. Nolan picks up on her shortcomings as an actress, and resorts to boob-shots en masse. This he should be fully entitled to do as a director, for a beautiful diversion will always camouflage the process and any of its potential missteps, as Michael Caine's character puts forward.With Scarlett as a pleasurable paint-job, twists by the bucket-load and flashy magic tricks as windowdressing to a solid mystery film, there is little or no need to delve deeper into the psyches of its characters to keep our attention. Yet this is done, and superbly so, by Christopher Nolan. 'Antihero' gets a whole new spin to it in The Prestige with two friends-turned-rivals so bitterly poised on the brink of obsession of outshining the other that succeeding with the ultimate 'prestige' of magic followed by applause is enough to drive them to murder, bankruptcy, deceit and sabotage. Borden simply wants to be better on a technical level, while Angier wants the public's recognition and wide-spread fame. Their ambition is in effect largely the same: create the definitive deceptive illusion and do it through any means necessary.'The Prestige' is a majestic film that nevertheless spans across too long a running time. Condensation would have done wonders and surely bumped it up a notch, as would underpinning some humour at one or two points (it is VERY gloomy), but it truly is a great cinematic achievement and a shoe-in for my top 10 of 1006, and easily the most inventive film I have seen in years. I am eagerly anticipated director Christopher Nolan's next sleight-of-hand direction, and it looks like the closest is The Dark Knight (2008).9 out of 10"
" One of the best movies EVER
",,What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians (or illusionists) it is also a complex character study about how self destructive obsessions are with a sideline love story and a sci-fi twist. A unique plot with an amazing cast--any of whom could believably garner an Oscar nomination. Christian Bale was amazing in one of his rare cockney performances. We already know from Kate and Leopold how well Hugh Jackman plays a distinguished English gent. He's absolutely priceless. Is there any point in discussing Sir Michael Caine? He brings polish to the movie. This is the kind of flick that you can discuss for weeks after. The plot is so detailed and complete and open to interpretation. My friend and I have been discussing various nuances of this film for the past 3 weeks. It definitely stays with you.
" This was an amazing movie!
",,This was the best movie I have seen in at least the past two years. Most movies have me leave the theater feeling like I wasted 8 dollars or so. So many movies lately have left me feeling like I wasted away precious hors of my life that could have been spent doing better things. Yet this movie was truly a masterpiece and kept me guessing the whole time. The acting was superb and so was the plot. I usually can predict the outcomes of movies pretty early on. And usually I can see the twist the writer planned. With this movie I was still left wondering into the last 5 minutes of the movie. I can't wait to own this on DVD.
" Magical!!!
",,"Long ago I watched The Prestige and The Illusionist in the same weekend. Comparisons are odious but it is inevitable for me to think of the second when talking about the first. You want to know why, keep reading.Magic is present in everybody's childhood, but it is something we lose, as we get older, in part because there are not many movies about magic to watch when you grow up. But if you want to turn the clock back and feel excited about how magicians perform tricks and get some answers about ""how it is possible"" or ""what's the trick"", lucky you because there are two movies which will definitely satisfy your curiosity.Both movies take place in England at the end of the XIX century. They not only have in common their genre, drama-mystery but also a fantastic cast. Edward Norton' remarkable portrayal of Eisenheim in The Illusionist is as memorable as Hugh Jackman and Christian Bales's in the Prestige. The appealing special effects, the convincing costumes and the compelling dialogue; you will enjoy these movies from the beginning to the end.Although there are several similarities between the two movies their plots are quite different. The Illusionist is, without a doubt, a much more romantic interpretation of the life of a magician. The Prestige, on the other hand portrays the rivalry between two magicians where revenge is the main feeling. The second movie is, indeed, more action-packed but no less moving than The Illusionist.These two must sees will trap you and will carry you to an enjoyable world full of magic. But if you really love cinema and good stories the one I highly recommended to you is the Illusionist."
" Does anybody look better in a top hat and tails than Hugh Jackman?...
",,"... but I guess that is really beside the point.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play two young British magicians - Alfred Borden and Robert Angier - trying to learn the tricks of the trade, somewhat even allied at first. Borden is a common Londoner, but Angier is to the manor born, using an alias in his magic work so as to not to embarrass his rich Victorian family. In the pursuit of a more fantastic trick a terrible accident occurs and Angier loses somebody close to him, vowing revenge against Borden, whom he holds responsible.These two are both the Roadrunner and Wiley Coyote to one another. Each one tries to sabotage and learn the other's tricks, make each other look
ridiculous, etc. Angier is the more dangerous of the two because he is truly intent on killing Borden when he infiltrates his ""catch the bullet"" act early on in the film and, instead, maims him. The rivalry ratchets up
to increasingly dangerous proportions. It is ultimately a fine piece of drama as to how far these two are willing to go in their obsession and for their art, with them both ultimately living tragic and miserable lives in the process. So much sacrifice for what most people would consider a trivial pastime. It is madness beyond obsession.This is a very entertaining and thought provoking film, and there is plenty of foreshadowing. Watch closely and watch it twice. I honestly don't think Christopher Nolan would be capable of linear storytelling if his life depended on it, but he is a master of this adapted material. At the end I could only go - ""Brilliant"".Scarlett Johannson plays Angier's lover who has a pivotal role in how the final act plays out. Rebecca Hall is Sarah, Borden's wife, who can't figure out why her husband seems to only love her on some days. David Bowie lends a real air of mystery to his portrayal of Nikola Tesla. But who else but Bowie could believably introduce his character by walking through lightning? Yes, the Tesla-Edison feud gets incorporated into the film and even a sci-fi angle is thrown into the plot. Michael Caine, as Jackman's magician mentor, seems to be playing his Alfred character from The Dark Knight. He has a supporting role, but watch him carefully, he has some of the most important lines of the film. And his final decision - do you think it was correct? Did two wrongs make a right in this unique situation?I wish I could tell you more, but I would give away the plot if I did. This is truly one of the better films made in the 21st century, and I largely don't like films made after 1960. Highly recommended and a real head scratcher, especially given the last line of the film."
" Masterfully Handled!!!
",,"I continue to be blown away at how fantastic this film is. It is executed with extreme precision. Every aspect of the film, all the way from visuals to the character development, is masterful.I'm not sure how it fared awards wise upon its release, but it should have racked up quite a few. The story is wonderfully layered, the acting is superb, the directed is spectacular, etc. I can't find anything about this film that I would change.Congratulations to the entire team that put this project together. I consider it one of the best films of all time.If you have the opportunity I strongly urge that you check this film out. I think you'll be glad you did."
" Fools and outsmarts the audience
",spoiler,"The truly amazing thing about this movie is that it has managed to fool nearly its entire audience into misinterpreting it, even though the clues it leaves behind are so numerous and apparent as to make the solution to the movie absolutely obvious. It makes a fool out of its own audience.The movie succeeds in tricking the audience into believing the machine is a cloning device, while actually being something else entirely. The true secrets are never revealed to the audience yet it believes it has an adequate solution. That is part of the brilliance of the movie. It tries to make a fool of the audience in general and succeeds.Im sure there are a few keen minds that truly understand what the machine does and are skeptical that Fallon is really Borden's twin, but the audience in general is duped into accepting faithfully what it's told. The movie never reveals its secret but the audience still feels the plot is resolved.It manages to paradoxically resolve the plot for the audience while not resolving it at the same time. It successfully sells them an alternate solution that isn't accurate and leaves them completely oblivious to the real solution. But they don't mind, because like the closing line says, the people watching ""want to be fooled."""
" I'm addicted to it
",,"Every so often I see a film that I get addicted to. As soon as I watch it in the cinema I know I'm going to buy it the day it comes out on DVD.Well The Prestige is the latest of these. This film gets better and better with each viewing. Hugh Jackman should have won many awards for his role. People say ""Oscar"" but there are better awards out there than that, the Oscars are about as representative of what's the ""very best"" as the IMDb's Top 250 list is.People have told me that they predicted the end, well that's their funeral, I never clicked until it was revealed for me, so I got much more value for my money.Christopher Nolan is a master. Even though he seems quite humourless in his DVD extra interviews. He makes extremely entertaining films that are well cast and superbly executed, just as the Prestige is. All those who never liked the film should be rounded up in a field and used for crazed scientific experiments, we could use Tesla!"
" Great movie, ruined by the ""ending""
",spoiler,"I say ""ending"", but since the ending is given away about 2/3 into the movie, its not really at the end. That is just where it is confirmed, to those who were in disbelief that such a great film could be utterly ruined.Plot lines are elsewhere, I am just going to explain why you should skip this movie. First, I will admit that except for this truly fatal flaw, it is an excellent movie. And that's why this was so incredibly disappointing. The movie takes place in the 19th century. Here on earth. And there is a central mystery that is woven throughout the film, and you wrack your brain trying to figure it out. You follow every twist and turn, scrutinize every detail, develop and evaluate theories on what the answer could be, and eagerly anticipate the revealing. And then, all of a sudden, its science fiction. They had a cloning machine. How completely cowardly a solution that was. If you are watching Star Trek or something, you know that you are in the world of science fiction, where anything goes. A cloning machine is a formal possibility, and if that ends up to be the explanation, you fully accept it because it makes sense in that reference frame. But it is entirely out of place when you are supposedly in a ""period piece."" Turns out, it was never a period piece, it was science fiction pretending to be a period piece. That's dumb. You can't develop some clever puzzle, and then wimp out and never solve it, but instead just invoke science fiction. Extremely lazy and irresponsible.This reminds me of another terrible move, The Forgotten. Same exact fatal flaw (except the rest of the movie wasn't that great either). There's a mystery, with clues and evidence that are seemingly impossible to reconcile, and you can't wait to find out how its being done. And then, they tell you its aliens from outer space. Gee, thanks. Stupid stupid stupid. Its more angering with The Prestige because it was so much the better movie, and they ruined it for no reason. A cloning machine over 100 years ago? How freaking stupid."
" Are you serious?
",spoiler,"Reading these drooling reviews, I have to wonder what has gone wrong with the movie-viewing community of late.This film is nothing more than a very expensive exercise in overstatement. How many times can we possibly hit our audience over the head with the same exact symbolism? How blatantly obvious can we make our ""elaborate plot twists"" by the end of the film? Hugh Jackman's closing speech is perfectly typical of this film. Shot and dying on the floor, he suddenly comes to this very drawn out and very boringly shot epiphany about how he was never REALLY obsessed with finding out his opponent's secrets. He actually traveled thousands of miles, spent countless amounts of money, (How did he have this, by the way?) shot, stalked, kidnapped, and did his very best to destroy his opponent's life, but he actually did it for ""the look on their (the audience) faces."" Please.And plot twists? No no no, my friends. There is precisely one plot twist, and it is given away by the ""tease"" at the beginning of the film. As soon as you see that the hat doesn't leave, you know the rest of the movie. Okay, it clones things. He makes new and kills one of himself every time. It's not a huge leap in logic, but the filmmakers see fit to treat the audience like a bunch of Neanderthal second graders.Finally, we are supposed to like the magician/twin that makes it back to his daughter in the end. Forgetting of course, the fact that he broke Hugh Jackman's legs, killed his wife, crushed that innocent woman's hand, and oh yes, shot and killed his rival. But he was justified, right? WRONG. Once again, Hollywood comes out with the kind of ambiguous, almost-moral movie that makes you just cringe with the pansy-butt quality of their statements.Please do both me and yourself a favor and skip this tripe."
" I love long, dark, well-acted and intelligent films but not this one
",,"I love a film that doesn't spoonfeed the plot and the story and the interest in it to the audience. This one takes you along if you are smart enough to go and if you are not so dumbed down by most entertainment that you can stay steadily involved.I wanted to love it to death...it has everything I think a film should have, including a wonderfully rich atmosphere, a great cast and excellent direction. Through most of it, it dares the audience to be intelligent and to have an attention span longer than a fruit fly. It had all the makings of a great film, but I kept looking for (and longing for) the greatness to impact me. It never did.It fell flat for me by the end. I really didn't care about any of them by then. I wasn't even sure I cared about the little girl. I certainly didn't care how anyone did any of the illusions; I was sick to death of their obsession with each other and just wanted them to move on already. Although there would be no film without it, it all seemed to be 'too much trouble to go through' and obsession is about getting caught up in it...for me, I couldn't get caught up in itnor could I quite get their obsession. Although Iam a big fan of the long, thinking person's film, I have to say I thought it dragged on and on by the end and I just wanted it over. It definitely did not leave me wanting more. I just wanted different.I had paid attention all along, I was impressed with the film and thought the acting, the cinematography and the direction were all superb. Even though some of the twists seem unnecessary, I thought many were brilliant and I kept trying to will myself to care about it, to care about them, but I didn't.It was a very good film in a detached sort of ""viewing art"" way but as far as feeling ""wow""'d by the end, not so much."
" Packed with more plot than you can imagine.
",,"If you think this film is mediocre or just a ""period piece"" then you have to think again because the true depth of this plot cannot be realized without watching repeatedly.I have watched it through several times and still can't tell if the Michael Caine character was the true mastermind.This screenplay could play in any time or place, even with unknown actors, and still generate eternal wonder.Too many directors rely on gratuitous violence, expensive action sequences, big name actors and grandiose sets/CGI to wow the viewers Christopher Nolan is an unmitigated genius and doesn't need any of those tricks."
" Top Notch cast and many plot twists will make this film a must see
",,"In a modern age where most films are either: remakes, sequels, or prequels it is nice to be able to view a modern day original film. Yes, it is an adaptation, from a book, but many viewers will probably not know that until they actually begin to watch the movie, like this reviewer. Rolling Stone magazine (as printed on the DVD cover) said it best, ""You want to see it again the second it is over."" Christopher Nolan, who last directed one of the best comic book movie adaptations, in ""Batman Begins,"" does it again with ""The Prestige."" ""The Prestige"" is based on a book, of the same title, that was written by Christopher Priest. The story is about two magicians who have been rivals to each other ever since the day they met and throughout the course of time, each of them tries to gain an advantage over the other. Eventually the friendly rivalry becomes an obsession. Their obsessions over trying to discover how the other does the trick, or how to upstage that trick, could turn into something that would kill one another.First things first, this reviewer will not make any comparisons to the other magic movie, ""The Illusionist."" What this reviewer will talk about is the plot. The story is fantastic. You cannot help but stay alert, and throughout the film you want to know what will happen next. There are many twists and turns to the plot, which will make you say, ""How did I not catch that?"" There is a quote in the movie that is used frequently, ""Are you watching closely?"" You need to be paying close attention in order to catch all of the various twists throughout the film.Besides all of the various twists, the acting was also fantastic. Hugh Jackman was a big surprise success as Rupert Angier. Christian Bale is always good and the trend continued as Alfred Borden. Michael Cane as always was great as Cutter. Scarlett Johansson was also very good as Olivia Wenscombe. Even David Bowie and Andy Serkis popped up as Nikola Tesla and Alley.Overall, there is not much to complain about. If you are looking for a movie about magic with a hint of science fiction, you should enjoy this. If you enjoy Christopher Nolan films, you should see this movie. If you enjoy movies in general, you should see this film. It is a shame this movie did not win any academy awards. ""The Prestige"" is recommended!"
" An insult to the intelligence (Possible Spoilers)
",spoiler,"This film really annoyed the hell out of me. It is definitely an entry into the oeuvre of movies that are so obsessed by how clever its twists are that it forgets to worry about things such as sympathetic characterisation, naturalistic expositional dialogue, and, most crucially, the effective execution of said oh-so-clever twists.First, a few points about the script. The script is dreadful in parts, with exposition that may as well be spoken directly to camera. The characters, Hugh Jackman's in particular, seem unrounded and without any kind of back story - seemingly plopped into the middle of an obsessive pursuit without any explanation as to where said obsessions may have originated. As happens in so many Hollywood movies, the female roles are perfunctory up to the point of pastiche - did anyone else groan with anticipation of how banal and run-of-the-mill Scarlett Johansson would be? I'd like to see a studio movie that, in the absence of an integral love story, crowbars in some half-assed romance entirely for the sake of some demograph of dubious existence who are believed to not want to see a movie without some histrionic sexual politics.Now, on to those twists, of which there are two major ones. The first, whose set up is established very early on, is glaringly obvious. I spent most of the film seething with frustration as lines that, in what i guess the makers hoped would be in hindsight, are massively irritating 'clues' to the audience. All this is abrogated by the fact that it was all clear to me from the off (and i wasn't aware there was a twist to the film so i wasn't looking out for one), all due to the fact that essential production values fail to adequately disguise the twist. The second twist, which acts not only as plot but supposedly as a thematic comparison to the first, is what left me wanting my money back. The filmmakers seemed to have forgotten that suspension of disbelief must be eared through establishing what can an cannot happen in the world they have created. For example, in The Matrix, when we shown that it is Trinity's love for Neo that brings him back from the dead, the audience is able to accept this because the reality that has been established is one of sci-fi machines-rule-the-world type. We have been prepared to be asked to go along with the possible. The Prestige, a film that throughout its running time shows and tells us that the magic in the film is one rooted in realistic trickery and that the rivalry between the two main characters is based on which can come up with the cleverest ruse, believes that it does not need to ask the audience to suspend its disbelief before laying down the biggest of deus ex machina macguffins seen in recent cinema. We are expected to believe that within this realistic turn of the century world that a machine is invented that (through science, not magic) can do what remains impossible in the present. This 'twist' represents lazy, lazy storytelling - it is like the writers could not come up with an actual clever ending so just used their get out of jail free card instead.On the side, there are some very pretty things to look at, with impressive period detail and some imaginative compositions from Nolan. Michael Caine and Andy Serkis are both excellent, and its always nice to see David Bowie on screen, but thats where the acting plaudits stop. Bale and Jackman give in uncharismatic and unlikeable performances and Johanssen floats along on a wave of arbitrariness.I would say to avoid this film, unless you enjoy the energy that truly hating a film can give you, as it has to me."
" Formulaic, contrived, predictable
",spoiler,"I don't know how any movie buff would not see the twists coming from a mile away. One can see when a twist is done in a tasteful and careful manner, and when the film makers are desperately trying to fit square pegs into round holes. Credit must be given to Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, and David Bowie for their superb acting. However Christian Bale(who I normally like) and Scarlett Johansson were terrible. A few of my specific gripes: 1. The ending is given away in the first minute. Christian Bale is accused of killing Hugh Jackman. EVERY MOVIE that starts with this presentation ends up with the supposedly accused being innocent.2. The cat was duplicated. Surely by this alone anyone can deduce that Jackman was also duplicated. Hence the pointless ""solving the puzzle"" scenes.3. Mystery/suspense turned into Steven Spielberg's Amazing Stories science fiction halfway through the movie.4. Jackman conveniently tears up the Transported Man secret(which was a driving plot) so he can be shot by Bale's twin brother.5. Jackman conveniently finds an exact look-alike in a bar.6. Bale's wife amazingly knows which days he loves her and which he doesn't, in a dire attempt to connect the twin brother twist.7. I was terribly disappointed with Perabo's death scene and subsequent funeral. These were two important moments in the film and should have been emphasized and given more attention. ""What knot did you tie?"". ""I don't know"". ""You don't know?"".8. A supposedly ""dead"" Jackman trots in public without any concern of being recognized to have a contrived face to face dramatic effect with his nemesis.9. Just get a gun and shoot each other in the back. The movie would be over in 10 minutes and there would be no need for tantalizing sabotages.To conclude, this movie was made with the intention of ""let's get in as many twists and turns possible"" rather than ""let's tell a good story with a twist""."
" No magic, just cheating
",spoiler,"In a film about magic and illusion, isn't it a shame that the makers cheat the audience who have waited patiently for the clever reveal. It's not so much a case of ""how did they do that, it's impossible"" as ""that IS impossible"". There's no magic trick at all, the whole conceit relies on a sci-fi teleporter/cloning machine which does not and never has existed. Well acted, well staged and filmed but the whole idea of the magic trick ending with a ""prestige"" is lost because, in this film, the trick has no prestige, just a sparkly device which, you feel, has been invented by the film-makers because they couldn't think up a clever ending. Twists and tricks are great in movies, provided they are believable and inventive. Doing the impossible is merely treating the audience as idiots."
" Remarkable. Nolan's best
",,"This movie was truly a game-changer for me. I initially saw it simply because I enjoyed some members of the cast so much (Bale, Caine, Bowie), but I left the theatre in awe. It is such a well-written, layered, intense, character driven story on par with Faustus or Jekyll and Hyde in terms of characters that are overly driven by their obsessions. It invites you to watch in the first lines of dialogue and from that point forward, you hardly have a choice. One of Nolan's strengths is that he doesn't shy away from difficult stories to tell. None of the characters are entirely likable. It's hard to pick someone to root for, but that is one of the things that makes them so human. Jackman and Bale are both fine actors that attack their roles with tremendous capability and Rebecca Hall is one of the best discoveries I've had in movies. Even Johansson, who is easily the weakest link, was used sparingly and didn't detract from the movie. The plot is fascinating and leads to an immensely satisfying ending. I can't watch this enough times."
" Great film
",,"I've been a fan of Nolan for a long time, ever since Memento. He has the ability to create mood and deep, well rounded characters better than almost anyone in the thriller genre, ever. For my money, only Hitchcock was better. And the Prestige was something worthy of the Master himself. Its is a dark, twisty, surreal film that truly goes unexpected places. Nothing is what it seems. And Nolan manages to pull of the twists, turns and surprises expertly, never once make a jump in logic that you don't take with him without question. The acting is phenomenal, Bale, Jackman and Caine are all excellent. But it is Jackman who owns this film. Between this and The Fountain (which I still don't know if I liked or not) he has really come into his own as an actor. Its a shame he was completely ignored at awards time this year. Towards the end of the year, there were some truly great films, but this is unquestionably the best. Its a well paced, thoughtful, intricate thriller that is better written than almost anything I have seen in years. Nolan is one of the most talented directors of his generation, something he continues to prove film after film. Howmany of todays ""franchise"" directors take a break in the middle of a superhero franchise to make a moody, dark period thriller about dueling magicians? The man is a master, only a notch below Hitchcock himself, and this film is his masterwork, so far."
" I have lost all respect for you people....
",spoiler,"How in the world is this in the top 250 movies of all-time? The performances are nothing to write home about- Bale's Cockney accent is laughable, as in it made me laugh the whole movie, the reason I first gave this movie a 3, Jackman might as well have been a statue, and apparently Nolan never told Caine that he wasn't still playing Alfred between Batman movies. The only way someone could enjoy this movie is if they were somehow ""fooled"" by the ""twists"". First of all, a twist is when you believe something and that something turns out not to be true. So there are no ""twists"" in this movie, because there is nothing to believe, the audience simply doesn't understand and the reason is eventually presented. Saying this movie has ""twists"" would be like saying someone performing card tricks has ""twisted"" your life. Second, I don't know how it's possible to be fooled by anything in this movie. It is obvious that Fallon is a double for Bale the entire movie, although I thought he was only a look-a-like, he was his twin brother. They say the entire movie you have to ""live"" your trick.They keep telling the wives and girlfriends ""a part of me"" and ""I loved you yesterday"" Then, how can anyone be fooled with anything in the ending? You know the machine clones things, why didn't you know Jackman was still alive.Which brings me to the point of what is this movie about exactly? It's about two loser magician twins, one of whom makes his wife commit suicide and the other denies his true love and gets hanged- all of this for what? Magic!! It's also about another loser magician who's wife drowns(the only real magic in the movie by the way)- and then receives a clone machine(now it's a sci-fi movie for some reason), which he uses to upstage the other two loser magicians (and mass murder), causing the remaining loser twin to shoot and kill him. And this is in the top 250? I take it back, I see the ""twist"" now.... that's magic!!"
" I wanted to love this film...
",spoiler,"...but it fell like a card-house. I really like the thought of the ""its all about the sacrifices you make"" plot but it just doesn't last. Up until Nikola Tesla did his cloning/teleport thingey I still had some hopes for the movie and I sat hoping that Tesla had faked the cloning just to get some more money when i saw the hats and cats on the ground. I genuinely hoped the filmmakers illustrated Tesla as a hoax, it sure seemed better than the movie getting all Star Trek! Unfortenately the writers didn't pick up that extra ace from their sleeves and the movie literally flat-lined and just died. Beam me up Scotty :("
" The best movie of the year! (minor spoilers)
",,"The Prestige is awesome! You have not seen a better movie in years! Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine are going to win some awards, let me tell you. And so is the screenplay. It's completely astonishing! The whole movie is! Robert Angier (Jackman) and his assistant, John Cutter (Caine), are into magic. Robert is the illusionist, and John is his assistant with building and testing illusions. When a man picks two volunteers to tie a woman (Robert's wife) to bind her in ropes so she cannot possibly escape the water cage (like one of Houdini's escape tricks), it all gets interesting. The two volunteers were Robert Angier and Alfred Borden (Bale), who didn't even know each other until that day where that woman -- who was Angier's wife -- drowned in the water cage all because Alfred Borden tied the knot in the assistant's hands wrong. She couldn't slip out of the knot. She died.Now Robert is angry. He shoots Alfred's hand later on in the movie, losing two of his fingers. Now, they are fighting at each other, not physically, just apart. THE TRANSPORTING MAN ILLUSION is a wonderful illusion that Alfred Borden made up, and now Robert is trying to steal his secret. He has become obsessed. So, he makes it better. BUT THERE'S TOO MUCH! JUST SEE THE MOVIE! Oh, and for those who pay attention to music in movies, you'll be disappointed. There's not much music to pay attention to. There's just some violins and other orchestral instruments here and there and occasionally there's a, ""BOOM"" of a timpani when you're supposed to be shocked or surprised at something.Sorry if I gave too much away, just PLEASE agree with my comment. I don't get any people who agree with my comments. I would greatly appreciate it.My MPAA rating: PG-13: Thematic Material, Some Very Startling Scenes of Violence, and Disturbing Images My Canadian rating: 14A: Frightening Scenes, Mature Theme, Violence"
" Demands to be seen over and over again
",spoiler,"A lot has been said about the film's beauty, but this is also an amazingly complex film and I think a lot of people didn't really get all that the first time. Some critics were upset about the twist ending while others were concerned with the sci-fi plot. To these people I say ""Are you watching closely?"" In retrospect, this film's cleverness comes from its plot that is structured similar to a magic trick. Both Angier and Borden's story, has a pledge, a turn and a prestige. In the film, they both share the same prestige; seemingly reappearing from the dead. The ultimate twist in the film is literally told to the audience several times, but as an audience we naturally doubt the obvious, and wish to be fooled. This is similar to a magic trick, we know the truth behind the magic; that it's not real, but only a great magician can, for a moment, make you doubt that truth. It's the magician's job, to quote the film, ""sell it all the way through"" and this film does just that. Even though you might have it figured out, the film gives you distractions that have you doubting it just long enough so when the pieces come together you realize what you just saw was something truly special. That's the beauty behind this film.The science fiction plot fits both visually and thematically. The film shows us that during this time period magicians had to change to keep up with the times, so they adopted more science fiction into their acts. This is why Borden and Angeir seek out Tesla. It brings closure to the other reoccurring theme in the film which is obsession, how far will one go? Their obsession to keep topping one another leads Angier to take it to the next level, but he goes too far, starts toying with real magic and ends up going to hell for it."
" Misdirection is one thing; this is another
",spoiler,"Sorry, but I guess I'm going against the grain on this one. I remember when Michael O'Donoghue was writing for National Lampoon; he had a ""how to write a short story"" article. The thrust of the piece was -- if you get bored or can't figure out an ending, have your character get hit by a bus. This movie seems to take that approach.The 'miracle' invention that Tesla apparently provided Hugh Jackman's character, which allowed him to duplicate himself, is nowhere referenced in the movie. The ending is a cinematic equivalent of ""then he got hit by a bus"". In short, I think the audience was cheated. Apparently most of the people who commented on this movie didn't mind that, but I thought it lacked integrity.Beautiful cinematography, tortured accents, and a conceit that's actual a deceit. Not recommended."
" Imaginative and intriguing crash of wits between two famous magicians
",,"This enjoyable and fresh story about intense rivalry among magicians is set in turn-of-the last century, London.Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) his wife Julie McCullough(Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden(admirable Christian Bale) are friends and magician's assistants. Then Julie accidentally deceases during a sideshow , Robert accuses Alfred for her killing . A new assistant named Olivia(Scarlett Johansson) helps Robert and he falls in love with her, though later she fell in love with another man. The magicians use their powers to combat among them. Both become prestigious magicians and get mutual envy. Magician Robert sees the Borden's transportation show and he becomes obsessed with his magic trick. They battle each other for their magic tricks and Robert attempts disclose the secret about disappearance from his contender with fateful results.This splendid movie is stunning in many aspects and blends appropriately various genres: the lush romantic period piece during nineteenth century Victorian Era, mystery thriller and fantasy.The picture gets it all : suspense, mystery drama, star crossed lovers,plot twists, murders,tragedy and supernatural illusions . Featuring an excellent casting, as main actors, Jackman, Bale, Johansson as eclectic secondaries, Caine,David Bowie,Andie Serkis and Rebecca Hall.Luxurious attention to period detail in brilliant costumes and spectacular production design . Beautifully and mesmerizing cinematography by Wally Pfister. Intriguing and evocative musical score by David Julyan. The motion picture is perfectly directed by innovator director Christopher Nolan, author of various masterpieces: ¨ Insomnia,Memento,Batman begins, Dark night¨. At the same time was made another film(2006)with similar theme titled 'The illusionist'by Neal Burger with Edward Norton, Paul Giamatti and Jessica Biel which also achieved much success. Rating : Above average, it was throughly amusing and exciting, and no as predictable as you would think. The film results to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work,it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final."
" Now you see it ... Now you wish you hadn't
",spoiler,"Sometimes I think movies are losing their magic. Over the years I have learned so much about the movie making process -- about how stunts and special effects are done -- that movies just don't amaze me quite as much any more. It takes a movie made with remarkable skill to make me forget the process that goes on behind the scenes to make the movie magic believable.To a great degree I suppose that is also true of magic as a performing art. The levitation trick or the sawing-a-woman-in-half bit may be eye-popping to one as a child, but eventually the magic of magic comes from learning the secret of the trick. The irony, of course, is that learning the secret usually destroys the magic. Knowledge is the natural enemy of illusion and magic (cinematic or sleight of hand) can only dazzle if it is so skillfully performed that the technique outweighs the mechanics. In short, achieving the ""Wow!"" before facing the question of ""How?"" THE PRESTIGE understands this, and yet it doesn't. It is, for most of the way, a flamboyant display of magician's showmanship, yet it builds up to a revelation of ""How?"" which comes off as something of a cheat. When the film gets around to revealing the secrets of its tricks, the reality seems far less credible than the illusion of supernatural power. The fake reality of illusion is explained with an even faker illusion of reality.The film deals with two turn-of-the-century London magicians whose rivalry as competing showmen is fueled by ever-escalating acts of revenge. They strive to not just top each other as performing artists, but to sabotage each other as hated enemies. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play the competing wizards (Robert ""The Great Danton"" Angier and Alfred ""The Professor"" Borden), who form an emotional juggling act, constantly tossing back and forth the roles of villain and victim. Like a magical coin, sympathy for either man disappears and reappears at unexpected intervals. Likewise, director Christopher Nolan keeps all of his balls in the air, telling the story with flashbacks within flashbacks in a way that is not nearly as confusing as it could have been. All in all, a very intriguing concept for a movie.Unfortunately, the filmmakers become would-be escape artists and place their film and the two protagonist into traps from which they can't seem to logically escape. Both magicians focus their attention on ""The Transported Man"" trick, which would appear to require the trickster to be in two places at once. But after promising not one, but two elaborate answers to how they did it, the film builds to a pair of shaggy dog endings, neither of which play fair with the audience. Alfred's secret seems so obvious in retrospect that viewers should have complete permission to slap themselves on their collective forehead for not seeing it coming a mile away. But the film cheats; revealing the secret early on by denying it as a possibility.On the other hand, Angier's secret takes a totally unconvincing sci-fi twist that not only doesn't play fair with the concept of magic as the art of illusion, but also defies the basic laws of physics. The story doesn't just cheat, it tries to change the trick in the middle of the performance. You don't leave the film feeling amazed; you leave feeling vaguely insulted, like the master illusionist has played you for a chump.Though lacking in humor (a vital distraction in creating illusion), THE PRESTIGE is a grandly played stunt, full of craftsmanship, showmanship and style. But it is like watching a magician who promises to produce a tiger out of thin air, but can only conjure up a kitten. The result isn't either ""Wow!"" or ""How?"" but ""Huh?"""
" Best movie I've seen in a long time
",,"Depicting the story of two magicians, who develop a rivalry that eventually turns out into a true war, ""The Prestige"" is a movie that keeps you connected all throughout its two hours. Some people said about it that sometimes the action tends to be boring, but I consider exactly the opposite: I didn't have the time to get bored, due to the very well-written story. The actors are amazing: Hugh Jackman - charming yet sometimes scary, as we know him, and Christan Bale, more lively but equally ""strong"" as in Batman Begins, are the two rival magicians. Their act is sustained by Michael Caine, as their mentor, and Scarlett Johansson. I didn't go to this movie expecting much, but after having seen it, I can say without any doubt that this is one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time, and I strongly recommend it. It's a film to savor and to feel (and eventually maybe to love)!"
" Dead Hats, Squashed Birds
",spoiler,"Let's face it, there aren't many good writers for cinema. Yet the bar has gotten higher while certain narrative structures have become more acceptable. Nolan has earned a place as one of the best without a Spanish surname. It seems he starts with a notion of multiple parallelisms in narrative, then fleshes them out using some of the techniques common in or best literature, but always envisioned first cinematically. The five parallelisms here are: Warring magicians (mirrored by the warring real life magicians Tesla and Edison). The realities of life and pretended or performed life, with the common fold of the play we see and the performance(s) they make. Multiple existence of beings Different slices of time as the narrative is unrolled backwards and forwards in bits. The way the stories are recounted in two overlapping diaries, each a lure. Pay particular attention to this, and the fairly literate references, starting with Van Helsing and covering at least a few Shakespearean phrases.Its therefore 5 times more clever, engaging and rewarding than ""The Illusionist,"" itself a competent oneway fold.Spend some time with this. That Batman thing went over well with some folks, I know. But it was a waste of talent. This is where the man belongs. Welcome home Chris. Stay away from comics.The acting is irrelevant. Good thing.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
" Sophisticated Movie
",,"The movie is astonishingly good. It kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time guessing what was behind this ""Transported Man"" trick. I had my own guess, but it turns out I was fooled along with others. The plot is very sophisticated, almost flawless and with the appropriately woven science-fiction scenes. 19th century London being on the edge of new ""electrified"" era was shown perfectly well, all the costumes matched the time, as well as the exteriors. The actors did a good job depicting their characters, especially I would like to point out the performance of Christian Bale. The movie is fully complete, doesn't require a sequel. Such movies are a very rare thing and are definitely must-watch!10 out of 10!"
" One of the most engaging and impressive character pieces I've seen all year
",,"""The Prestige"" got some bad reviews early on, and at one point it was listed on RottenTomatoes.com with less than 30% fresh rating. I went to see it, as a result, with mixed expectations. On one hand, I think Christian Bale is the next great method actor and I firmly believe Christopher Nolan is on the pathway to really carving out a name for himself in Hollywood (beyond the fanboy audiences). He's still being advertised as ""The Director of Memento and Batman Begins"" but soon it will just be ""From Director Christopher Nolan."" As for the film? Exceptional. Inventive, unique and twisted. Bale and Hugh Jackman deliver career-making performances. It's by far Jackman's best performance on film (in a serious role) and one of Bale's best, which is saying a lot. This guy can do anything. It's amazing to see him in ""The Machinist"" a few weeks ago and then turn around and see him here. Within the past year alone he's moved up many ranks in my book. (Of course, I don't have a book. But if I did...) The film is dark, and its blend of reality with sudden fantasy may throw some viewers off. But I don't think it's a cop-out, as some people have claimed. It's just Nolan's style. Batman incorporated many different genres and themes that one wouldn't necessarily expect from, of all things, a Batman film - and here The Prestige delivers some magical material that I didn't see coming. Even knowing the ending ahead of time (after it was ruined by an ignorant IMDb user who thought it would be funny to spam people with the ending), it still came as a shock in delivery.What I finally felt so satisfied with was the film's direction, acting and character development. With a lesser director it could have easily been a lame exercise in style over substance and a flashy, gimmicky ending. Nolan elevates it and the two lead performances are really engaging. It works as a morality tale as well as an intense character study that has you alternately rooting for both men to succeed. And the film changes perceptions of past events so often that by the end you're kind of sitting there, shocked that it's played out so vastly different than what was expected.Chilling, gripping movie. Had me consistently engaged from beginning to end, and I'd say in some ways it's the most well-made Nolan film yet."
" Too much sci-fi?
",spoiler,"As a fan of old Twilight Zone episodes, I love the surreal aspects of The Prestige, specifically Tesla's quest to create a transporting machine that can turn magic into reality. However, a friend of mine, who does not like this movie, sees this plot as an unfair cop-out. According to him, the film's writer breaks the rules of the film's reality when he allows Hugh Jackman's character to use Tesla's machine to duplicate himself in a science fiction-like manner.If the writer sees no problem including science fiction in this story, why not just give Hugh Jackman's character the ability to fly? Or better yet, why not have aliens transport Hugh Jackman's character across the stage? Neither option would be more absurd or unrealistic, and in my friend's opinion, both destroy the film's reality in the same manner."
" Great trick....how did they do that ?
",,"I totally enjoyed this film from beginning to end. The acting, costumes, and locations were superb. Funny, the only other movie I've enjoyed as much this year was ""The Illusionist"". (Pick a card, any card....) I've always been interested in the life and times of Nikola Tesla. This movie was a great tribute to this misunderstood, brilliant scientist. Yes, just like time-travel scenarios, this film makes you think but not enough to give you a brain cramp. It's twists and turns rival the most demanding road rally track and will keep you involved the whole time. Not too many films do that for me anymore. It's a terrific way to spend 130 minutes. Be sure to have plenty of popcorn on hand."
" A Great Tale of Rivalry, Obsession, Revenge and Sacrifice
",,"In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his beloved wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.""The Prestige"" is a great tale of rivalry, obsession, revenge and sacrifice. The unpredictable screenplay has many twists, disclosing unusual situations and hooking the attention of the viewer until the very last scene. Christopher Nolan, after the masterpiece ""Memento"", offers another excellent movie for the cinema lovers, better and better than the Oscar winner ""The Departed"". The amazing dispute between the outstanding Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is supported by the extraordinary Michael Caine and a wonderful cinematography. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""O Grande Truque"" (""The Great Trick"")"
" Atrocious acting, preposterous plot, sadly not a joke
",spoiler,"'Prestige' starts as Jules Verne and ends as Star Trek on a bad day.Atrocious acting: Ever heard of 'Mummerset? It's the word used to describe the ridiculous accent that actors use to indicate they're from the English countryside, the sort of 'ooh-arr' sound that Robert Newton makes in 'Captain Blood'. In 'The Prestige', the ridiculous accent used is 'Mockney', the one actors use to sledgehammer that they're from London. Luckily for Michael Caine, he was born an East Londoner, but the rest of the troupe in this pile of tripe look and sound like they're auditioning for 'Eastenders' (a dreadful UK soap), trying to out-gorblimey each other. Caine does his usual reliable turn as the worldly-wise buddy who's powerless to stop things going wrong, as seen in 'The Man Who Would Be King'. And go wrong they do. When David Bowie is the actor giving the best performance in your movie, you're in trouble. The interchangeable cardboard magician's girl assistants do not manage the transition from TV acting to big screen at all. Caine once did a TV 'masterclass' about screen acting, the upshot being that you shouldn't blink in closeup - note how all the other actors fail to observe this rule, and it shows Caine was right.Preposterous plot: The movie opens with the death of Jackman, where Bale is on Death Row for his murder, and is told partially in flashback to when Bale and Jackman are rival magicians. Bale, for some reason he can't remember, contrived to cause Jackman's wife to die in a trick, so that naturally Jackman is obsessed with revenge. He's also obsessed with discovering the secret of Bale's 'Transported Man' trick, where the magician instantaneously moves from one side of the stage to another. Now at this point, about an hour in, I thought I'd guessed the ending. Jackman has to hire a double in order to pull off Bale's transportation trick; the only problem is that he ends the show beneath the stage while the drunken, stroppy double gets all the applause. (Somewhere along the way, Jackman acquires a wooden leg, which appears overnight, but doesn't seem to inconvenience him beyond a slight limp). Of course, I thought - Jackman eventually gets the double to perform the 'Pledge and Turn' (the opening premise of the trick), so that the double is the one who gets drowned in the tank placed below stage by Bale. I was wrong. We are eventually asked to switch from a reasonably atmospheric period melodrama (think 'The First Great Train Robbery') to schoolboy science fiction. Jackman, at vast expense of which we get no explanation, buys a cloning machine - yes, a cloning machine - from real-life distinguished inventor Nikola Tesla (Bowie). Every time he performs the trick, Jackman dies and is cloned back to life, in the traditional 'Star Trek' transportation manner. What? WHAT? Just as well Tesla's machine didn't work, or he'd be back to give Christopher Nolan a piece of his mind. Sadly not a joke: if 'Prestige' were even just a little tongue-in-cheek or camp, you might be able to feel that your intelligence was not being not just insulted but placed in the stocks and pelted with rotten vegetables, ordure, and pseudo-science as seen in ads for hair conditioner. No, 'Prestige' is deadly serious about itself as a history lesson and as a drama. Starting as Edgar Allen Poe meets Jules Verne, it ends up as Doctor Who meets Star Trek, and it's a train wreck. A terrible film."
" Stop Rating Christopher Nolan Movies a 10!
",spoiler,"Christopher Nolan is an undeniably great filmmaker and every movie of his I've seen I'd give at least a 7......that doesn't mean everything he does should be on the IMDb top 250, let alone this high up! I feel like everybody rates Christopher Nolan's films a 10 simply because he directed them. It irritates me to see movies such as this and Interstellar so high up on this list when (although they're both fine movies) there are so many other (in my opinion) objectively better films that deserve those slots. I pretty much only wrote this to complain about the inflated scores on most of Nolan's films, but I'll talk briefly about the film. The acting was very good and the presentation was nice but nothing spectacular. There aren't many specifics for me to complain about besides the ending, which is why this review has a spoiler warning. The ending makes the film contradict itself. Basically it turns out Christian Bale was playing a pair of identical twin brothers the whole time. Hugh Jackman gets Christian Bale hanged, only to get shot by Bale's twin. His twin was the reason he was able to perform the teleporting man stunt so seamlessly. This goes against the whole philosophy Bale's character was preaching! Its stated multiple times that the reason Bale could perform the trick so seamlessly was because unlike Jackman, he supposedly wasn't using a doppelganger. But then at the end it turns out he WAS using a doppelganger the whole time! JUST BECAUSE YOU HAVE AN IDENTICAL TWIN DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE THE SAME PERSON! YOU'RE TWO DISCRETE ENTITIES! YOUR CLAIM IS A LIE!In essence, the rest of the film is great but the stupid ending tarnishes the experience as a whole."
" Ruining the Good Name of the Mystery...
",spoiler,"A true mystery cannot include supernatural action or agents unknown to science, nor any physical impossibilities (or even improbabilities).The enjoyment that one gets from watching a mystery unfold is in the collection of clues by a gifted amateur detective (either a character in the story, or the audience itself with some aid from the script), the clever mis-direction and art of the author, and a satisfying conclusion.The conclusion is the key -- it must be innovative, and coherent. (Agatha Christie, of course, was the master. Everyone on the Orient Express did it; that's original, and satisfying. The police officer set the Mousetrap; that's original, and satisfying. The hanging judge faked his own death in order to direct suspicion elsewhere; that's original, and satisfying.) What is the point of crafting a lenghty story, and then saying at the end: ""Yes, it all WAS possible, see? The existence of the *flibbertigibbet machine* means that it could have happened."" A 'twist' that amounts to ""I, the writer, can do whatever I damn well please"" is simply hackneyed.'Electrical cloning' is impossible. It cannot be done. Saying it can -- and was, by Nikola Tesla -- is idiotic.While we're throwing around impossibilities concerning historical figures, we might as well just make a film about Queen Elizabeth I conquering Mars, or Julius Caesar inventing time travel using silver coins and sunshine. What an absolute waste of my time.PS. If the machine was a diversion -- all of the flashbacks and double-crosses muddied the story sufficiently to allow the possibility -- I still want to know why there are human forms in all of the many water tanks in the warehouse at the end of the film.The question the author wants us to ask is: are these the dead canaries, so to speak, or are they yet another layer of mis-direction?I think I can say this: if this were just another layer, and I am supposed to believe that the human forms are manniquins or stolen corpses, I am even more angry with the author. A pathetically low level of storytelling would have been reached.Both choices come out to the same result: a horrific stain on the good name of the mystery."
" This movie is an insult to your IQ
",spoiler,"If you have some IQ and haven't watched this movie yet, don't.At the beginning everyone believes that this movie is going to be brilliant and all the tricks of those magic will be explained. But no, in the end the script writer and director just slap on your face: This is a sci-fi movie you idiot! That replicator machine ruined all the suspension the movie has built in the first 2 hours. All the tricks suddenly become so cheap.It could have been much better if Angier cooperates with that double man and drown him in the end to frame Borden up. But instead, the director got you some alien or terminator machine to replicate 100 Angiers.I registered an account on IMDb just to give this movie one star. You can see how disappointed and angry i am ."
" Fantastic for 120/130 minutes
",spoiler,"Undoubtedly beautiful and well acted, The Prestige feels like it is constantly challenging the viewer to find the secrets below its surface.The characters themselves are well written with understandable motives and actions that accompany them. In fact everything presented is understandable and can be explained by the rules of the world we live in, until the reveal. And it is at the point of the reveal the movie lost me, because the movie that had up until this moment presented itself as a period piece turns out to be sci-fi masquerading as a period piece.There is nothing wrong with sci-fi, but to (seemingly) present a puzzle to the viewer that it turns out was unsolvable all along feels cheap and unsatisfying."
" Simply best
",,"Screenplay , story telling and characterisation . nolan at his best . twist after twist . must watch movie for movie lovers"
" Disappointingly obvious
",,"There are many reviews on this site saying how after The Prestige they walked out of the theater in awe with jaws dropping. Personally, I didn't get it.The movie was a trick badly done. The ""turn"" is too transparent, revealing all the secrets to one that isn't simply waiting for the prestige. That is, by the middle of the movie, you can have a pretty good idea of how it will end. This would be fine if not for the fact that the ending is really all this movie is about. I suppose you might be able to enjoy it, if you're not that analytical and just take things as they are.Personally, I enjoyed The Illusionist much more, although that movie too had an all-too-obvious plot.Finally... as for those denouncing Tesla, rumors have circulated even until today about his experiments. The trick with the lightbulbs as seen in the preview? That was, and is, possible. Yes -- Tesla invented it. Tesla experimented with all kinds of things, including the technology seen in this movie. If anyone could have accomplished such a feat during that era, it would have been Tesla. This is a work of fiction so do take it with a grain of salt."
" Go see it and judge for yourselves
",,"This film seems to have polarised IMDb posters like no other for a while.I don't know if it is a trick (sic) of time but the posts at the top of this list seem to love it and the posts at the bottom hate it. Is this due to having had time to think about it before commenting? In my case no. I came out of the theatre thinking what a good film, but by the morning, what a great film.The mere fact that it plays on the mind, and requires a lot of thought to see some of the holes (yes there are some but not as clearly dismissed as in some other films)gives an indication of the impact it had on me.I had to laugh at the comments over the accents and ""mumbling"". It's called English. It is not ""American English"". I don't criticise American actors for talking in American accents, so please don't do the same to my native tongue.My only advice here is go and see it for yourself if you have not already. Oh and look up a certain Nikola Tesla on Wikipedia if this name is not familiar to you.And finally, don't forget, it's a film. And fiction. It's not real, or historic. Enjoy it. I did."
" Far to interesting for the average bum
",,"Now this was a movie that made you stop and think and then think again, and then go buy a ticket to watch again and think. Most of the people in the audience looked stupefied at the end of this flick. No greater tribute can be given for a movie based on magicians, magic, and science fiction. This is every magicians dream and to do it through the cinema is quite a trick in itself. The performances are excellent and Christian Bale as always is the character in life and breathe. Hugh Jackman is so turning out to be more than an eye catcher and can act in the most excellent and gentlemanly fashion. Michael Caine.......when don't you turn in an awesome performance. Scarlett Johanson does an excellent job and surrounded by such thundering performances, how can she not excel in the pouted way of hers and it is put most excellently to use in this movie. Take the rabbit out of the hat and take a bow, this was definitely a magic trick of a movie."
" Ludicrous
",spoiler,"Memento was much worse than this, but The Prestige is empty and nonsensical in equal measure. At what point did the two brothers decide, 'Crikey, we ought to give up this brothers lark and hide ourselves from the world so we can pull off the Transported Man trick'? When they were still kids? And who thought it was a good idea to cast David Bowie as the Serbian lord of alternating current? If you like movies with two preposterous twists -- it's not just the twin brothers who are so dedicated to their art that they'd chop off their fingers and sleep with each other's girlfriends, but A MACHINE THAT ACTUALLY TELEPORTS PEOPLE ACROSS VARYING BUT QUITE SHORT DISTANCES!! -- then this is definitely for you.One thing I've learned is that, if ever you chance upon the diary or journal of your nemesis, make sure you read from the back to the front. You have been warned!"
" The Prestige doesn't work due to acute predictability
",spoiler,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is a very good looking movie and is very well acted. That having been said Chris Nolan plants so many winks toward the audience and little hints everywhere so that the ""not so average"" movie goer could see where it is leading one hour into the film. I did and so I am greatly disappointed.If ""The Prestige"" carries such an elaborate plot, with many twists and turns and a touch of sci-fi to it (no spoiler warning needed, it is mentioned in the commercial) then why make it simple for audiences to follow it? Movies like this carry great weight with terrific work and craftsmanship but for the second hour I sat in the theater knowing the end.This is not really a review, seeing that I don't need to review this film after hundreds have already done, but it is simply that if you follow the film properly (by listening to what the characters say without taking everything literally and by seeing everything that you are indeed seeing) its payoff will be quite sub-par.I compare this to ""The Illusionist"" because both films attempt to pull off a con on the audience. ""The Illusionist"" carries more grace, in its almost 1920's film-making style, and the plot is harder to figure out but overall it carries realism, which ""The Prestige"" does not (by a long shot).5/10 due to a terribly predictable story that is purposely woven in that fashion by Chris Nolan. If you want to see film that is airtight and what ill awe you, watch his film ""Following"".D."
" It Had Its Moments
",,"I found the most interesting part of this movie to be the behind the scenes look at some of the tricks used by illusionists and magicians. The broader story has great potential. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival illusionists in late 19th century London, whose rivalry goes beyond just a fun competition and becomes dangerously obsessive with ultimately tragic results. All that sounds pretty good, and both Jackman and Bale were solid in their roles as Angier and Borden respectively, as was Michael Caine as Cutter, Angeirs' assistant. Spoiling the story somewhat for me was a sort of mini-subplot about the rivalry between Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla. Edison is never depicted in the movie, while Tesla is played by David Bowie of all people. That rivalry was very real of course but dissolves into a bit of a farce here, as Tesla has supposedly invented some sort of teleportation device that Angier wants to use in his show. A simple and obsessive rivalry would have been quite sufficient without that dive into sci-fi silliness. I also have to say that while the movie certainly had its strong points, for the most part the story just didn't take hold of me. I found it a little long and slow-paced at times, and in the last 15-20 minutes there just seemed to be too many twists and turns happening, which again took away from the story's credibility. In the end, my reaction was that this was OK, but nothing more. 5/10"
" A little confusing, but excellent performances make for an otherwise great all-around film
",,"I was stoked to see The Prestige from the moment it first began gaining buzz. Hugh Jackman. Christian Bale. Scarlett Johansson. Michael Caine. Christopher Nolan. It just had the marks for something great, and the trailers only continued to perpetuate this ideally amazing film. While the film does deliver in many instances, I cannot help but feel that it was anywhere near as good as I could have imagined. Whether I hyped it up far too much or not, is up to interpretation.It is the late 1800s, and magicians are the key theatrical acts in London. Rupert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are two up-and-comers who work together, and then instantly turn into rivals after a particularly devastating incident early in their careers. What follows is a tale of both men finding a means of one-upping each other at every turn, whether it be physically sabotaging the other person's act, using the sexy assistant Olivia (Johansson) to help get secret information, or gaining help from the even more secretive ""wizard"" Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, in a rare film appearance).The thing about the film is that you have to pay attention at all times. It has moments where the film feels speedy, and others where it feels downright slow. But no matter what, something integral is always happening. Despite it being told in a particularly bizarre narrative structure (the present flashbacking to the past flashbacking even further into the past, and then back again), the film follows the key three-part magic act sequence (which any trailer fan should probably already know about). The film suffers here because it does not really stay consistent with the direction it wants to go in, and becomes a bit confusing and inane as a result. It may be a bit of a struggle to grasp the structure at first, but slowly becomes more easily accessible. At times it works strongly, but in others, it just feels like it wants to toy with the audience and do nothing else. We know every little detail matters, but should the material not be a little more solidified than it is? A bit of extra padding and focus here could have helped greatly.Being a period piece, you can see the great care and devotion taken to ensure that the film looks like it is occurring at the turn of the twentieth century. It may be dark, but there is just enough light to shine through and make everything all the more colourful. The costumes are all lavishly gorgeous, as are the backdrops and set pieces. It feels distinctive and authentic, but not to the point of being overkill. The score is just about perfect, and the editing really helps to act as the drive of the film. The great British accents are all highly in tune with the rest of the feeling of the film as well, even from the American actors.Jackman and Bale are excellent in their respective roles. Right from the start, you can tell these two are steering towards destruction, and as their characters slowly move into becoming downright evil, it becomes even more of a pleasure for the audience to watch. They play off each other well in their scenes together, and their presences are downright smoldering. These young actors really show off their chops, and show off the deeper range that only a few select modern actors can even pray to be able to show. While I really enjoy Jackman as an actor, I cannot help but realize this is one of his deepest roles yet. He's very striking in the role, but at times you can see that this is one of his first real attempts at doing so. Bale on the other hand, can add this right next to his already brooding library of ranged works (his most astonishing being his turn in American Psycho), and looks like he is right at home with the material. I know they probably will not get recognition during the awards season, but I can only hope this is a taste of things to come from both of them.Caine is great as the wise manager character that he has perfected over the years, and Bowie's small performance is practically intoxicating. He does not play the character up too much, but he plays it with just the right amount of intensity demanded. He is complemented by Andy Serkis, who thankfully plays a real-life character and not one made totally out of CGI. It was something different to actually see him literally acting, and I was pleasantly surprised to see it be just as good, if not better, than his CGI-work. Although they only have so much they can do, the three main female characters, Johansson, Piper Perabo, and newcomer Rebecca Hall all perform excellently, and work well off their co-stars. I would have liked to have seen a bit more material being used by these three, but they really stand up well against their much more heavily used male co-stars.Inevitably, the comparison to this year's ""other magician"" film, Neil Burger's The Illusionist, must come up, and thankfully, it works at about the same level. They both have strong acting (although the female acting is far superior here), a good storyline, and beautiful sets. If anything, The Prestige feels like it wants to accomplish more than it can handle. Thankfully, it does not become too overbearing, but some of the confusion the film generates really does detract from it.Although not as good as Memento or Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan has added another strong film to his short resume, and continues to prove his worth in Hollywood. I can only hope that the audience does not get too overly distracted by the film's structure problems, and can truly appreciate this all-around great film.8/10."
" This movie is a masterpiece
",spoiler,"I remember seeing 'The Illusionist' a couple of years back and I was so impressed as it was my first film of the genre (give me a break, I am 20 and I wasn't seeing many films of this kind back when I was a kid). Well, this is my second film of the same genre and they were both released in the same year, with my favourite actors - Hugh Jackman & Edward Norton. They are both strokes of genius, but this is the better one of the two, as this is more complex (much much more) than The Illusionist. I am glad that I saw this last night on TV. I didn't know anything about the story and I really enjoyed it.Every magic trick consists of three acts - the first is 'The Pledge', the second is 'The Turn' and the final, hardest, most important act is 'The Prestige'. Thus begins the story of The Prestige. The climax is shown in this scene itself, that of Angier being drowned and Borden just standing there. So, Borden is convicted of Angier's murder and is sentenced to death. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) has stolen Borden's diary to unravel his 'Transported Man' trick and has went to Tesla to make his own machine, which is better than Borden's trick. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a tormented man who doesn't want to part with his secret near his end, but doesn't have a choice if he has to see his young daughter grow up perfectly. Cutter (Michael Caine) is Angier's producer or something, but he's more like a close confidante rather than an employer.Then, the true story begins to reveal itself which is set in the 1900's. Borden and Angier have a long history. They are two rookie illusionists who work for the same man, Cutter. Borden had inadverdently caused the death of Angier's wife who was also his assistant. Then Borden has the audacity to tell Angier that he doesn't know which knot he tied on her, but it is not his fault really, he truly doesn't remember. Angier is a born showman who has everything that a magician should have, knack for misleading the audience easily. Borden is a more talented magician who doesn't have the showmanship, but he is improving constantly. Angier and Borden now entangle themselves into a life of dual in which neither can win, as we are shown at the starting itself. While Borden falls in love with Sarah, a sweet and beautiful young lady, Angier is sinking into a life of revenge against Borden. Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) is the beautiful assistant of both Angier and Borden. She loves both of them, but she has a much more meatier part than I am telling. I won't elaborate more on the plot than this, as it will be more amazing to see it without knowing anything about it.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play off each other perfectly and the period setting of the movie is beautiful. Except for the Batman movies, this was the first time I saw Bale in any other character and I loved his portrayal of Borden. (I skipped Terminator 4 as my friends said it was bad). Every actor performs amazingly and this was a film which I loved as the plot takes so many beautiful turns and twists, all done in a believable way (except, Tesla's machine, which won't give a shock to humans). The film also has three acts, the ending which they show at the beginning is elaborated further in the real climax. This film flows forward like a calm river which has a fall coming. It was really beautiful and poetic in many ways. The cinematography is excellent, the background score is also beautiful and the sets look very authentic. I didn't root for any one character, as both of them are flawed and no one's an upstanding man. They have their own beliefs and different methods to achieve them, but I didn't root for one, I cared for both. The ending is quite shocking and pleasing as well. If you still haven't watched this, please don't let this gem of a film pass you by. If there is a choice to see three films before I die, this will definitely be one of them.10/10"
" deeper and deeper (it should have won many Oscars)
",,"At the beginning, this movie is like an anonymous box: you don't know what there's inside. So you open it, and what you find? Two boxes. Then you open those boxes, and find three more boxes. You go on opening and the only thing you find is more and more boxes. But, after all, aren't all the boxes part of the first one? When you wake up in the morning, you look at yourself in the mirror in front of you. This movie adds another mirror, behind your back. And then the pictures of you in the mirror become more and more; you don't have to turn back. But, after all, aren't all the pictures showing just one face? You've got a hundred-dollar bill in your wallet. This movie just turns it into five dollars'. Then into one's. And then into coins. But, after all, haven't you got one hundred dollars? At the beginning this movie is simple, ordinary, like an anonymous box, like your picture in the mirror, like an hundred-dollar bill. But then the best of all the living directors, Christopher Nolan, adds one, then two, then three more little things, and everything becomes faster, darker, deeper. And at the end you can just clap your hands: after all, isn't it just a movie?"
" Another Magical Work by Nolan.
",,"After watching 3 of Christopher Nolan's shows, I really have a high expectation of this movie. In addition to the great director, the cast selection is superb as well. Well, thankfully I'm not disappointed by this movie.""The Prestige"" is filled with twists and turns. I think how you see the twists and turns will affect what you think of the movie eventually. Some people will be fascinated by them (like me), while others won't. Well, the story can be basically summarized to two themes, Deceit and Obsession. I thought Nolan chooses a great way to present the story. Though the back and forth narration may confused some people, I thought it really works well for the movie, teasing audience to figure out how the story really goes. I feel that the type of flashbacks here is different from those used in Nolan's ""Insomnia"" and ""Memento"", though they are effective for their respective movies.I watched the show with some book spoilers in mind. To those who had read the book, well, the story is rather different from the book. The ending especially. The movie does not mention about the descendants of the Magicians at all.Hugh Jackman's and Christian Bale's acting are amazing. One supporting actor which I think stands out is David Bowie's Nikola Tesla. His charisma really makes his character interesting.Like other Nolan's movies, this movie is visually stunning. You won't be disappointed by its cinematography.Despite being a great movie, I don't think that this movie will be one of the major contenders for Oscar. The genre doesn't really suit well with Oscar type of movies.Nevertheless, in my opinion, this movie is one of the best movies this year, and is definitely a must watch."
" great direction... awful ending
",spoiler,"The movie had a great set-up and very good direction and story telling... however the ending was completely awful. The duplication machine was beyond ridiclous for a movie with a serious tone. Its as if the writers, during the screenplay, ran out with ideas on how to end the movie and explain how ""The teleportation man"" trick actually works... so instead just decided to make a fantasy ending/ explanation. However, as with all christopher Nolan movies, the movie is paced very well with a lot of realistic twists and turns. the story telling (up until the last 10 minutes) is very good. However, the main problem is the two big twists. The teleportation machine was previously discussed. The other was the ridoclous plot twist of the twin brother. It is obivous the writers reached too much to create a magic trick they couldn't logically explain themselves so they created the twin, and added a sprinkle of hints throughout the movie to attempt to give crediablity to the awful ending"
" Not worth the trouble
",spoiler,"This is a very good example of Hollywood spending a lot of money on stars and directors to try to make a great, deep movie, and failing. The ""art style"" editing, cutting scenes back and forth in time, trying to make the story, cut up, seem deeper than it is.Why is he in Denver, where is Tesla, why is Scarlet Johannsen even in this movie, who cares about the surprise ending (and who believes it?)?? These are all good questions that we scarcely care about. Just looking at my watch waiting for it to end.The actors are good, but you actually need an interesting story to tell. A similar period (Sherlock Holmes' London) is done much better with the Downey/Law flic just out. For this one, don't see it in a theater, don't pay to rent it, maybe watch it if someone lends you a copy or you are huge Hugh Jackman fan, otherwise, save your energy."
" Ab-ra-cadaver
",spoiler,"Fans of truly great bad acting, crushed birds, bogus history, boredom, bogus science, preening smugness and amateur amputation -- this idiotic flimflam is for you.And if you thought mining or bridge-building was a dangerous game around 1899, think again. Stage magic was apparently fatal or, at last, crippling for nearly everyone involved -- especially if you were an assistant or a canary. Might have been a sound move to avoid using blind (I am not making this up) stagehands. Playing tricks on the audience is as old as film -- perhaps the medium itself should be seen as one big trick -- but this is so clunkily done and so much is signalled in advance (just one example of many -- closeup of rope, medium shot of distraught woman, closeup of rope again, then, abracadabra, silhouette shot of human pendulum -- and watch out for anyone with a limp and of being hit over the head by repeated, blatant examples of duality).Except for Caine, Serkis (maybe) and the feline Bowie, the performers of these very unlikeable characters are cringingly inept with Hugh Jackman taking the marzipan for playing multiple roles so astoundingly badly that you wonder if he thinks great acting consists of SHOUTING while crying and, possibly, having your nose run (or was that yet another tear?). After all, I suppose, if you can't be childishly histrionic at your own wife's funeral, what's the point of turning up? And as the out-of-work actor (if only!) Jackman seems to be doing an outrageous send-up of Robert Newton (not known for his own under-playing, I think). If the idea of such cardboard cutout characters battling over who is the greater not-very-inspired magician seems a bit thin, well, you might be on to something -- at more than two hours this is wildly overlong as well as overwrought. It is also a bit hard to care who wins the ""duel"" (or how) if you think each is a boring, revolting, homicidal creep. Even the magic business is supposed to be entertaining from time to time but these guys aren't just magicians, they're psychics and so know all about tricks like Sawing a Woman in Half which, as Chris Priest knows, was invented by an illusionist called Selbit and not performed until 1921. (According to the author the dueling magicians' story ends in 1903.)And where does the sadomasochism come from? With all the gloating over gore, violent death and grime, you'd think Mel ""Mad Monk"" Gibson had had a bloody hand in this. Yet all this grimness is so very silly -- no sense of period; no sense of the theatre or of how magicians actually work; no point of view; no sense of time (which does, probably, have a kind of inexorable reality); above all, not a trace of irony or humour (though some in the audience I was in laughed when one of the ridiculous Hugh Jackman characters fell down). I suppose, though, it is rather comical if the great (offstage) villain is Thomas Edison -- in fact, he may be the Moriarty here, the Napoleon of Crime -- let's hear it for direct current.There may be an interesting movie to be made about the business of magic in the late 19th Century theatre -- but this is definitely not it. It's a typical Hollywood mess which says nothing new, makes not a whole lot of sense and assumes (perhaps correctly) that the audience is a pack of clods. The novel (as usual) makes more sense than the movie which is (as usual) the mucked-up, dumbed-down version of part of the story. While you can't set a whole novel on film (though there have been some interesting attempts) you don't need to turn it into some sort of crazy, inept pantomime set in a mortuary.Many of the changes/""improvements"" are inexplicable -- why, for example, is Rupert Angier now Robert? Murdoch-phobia?? Some are crudely for US consumption -- you try putting a pre-decimal English penny in a pistol and see how far you get!And it's full of unsubtle tricksiness such as ""AB"" (Alfred Borden) ""RA"" (Robert Angier) ""C"" (Cutter - no first name? Like Sabu or Paladin?) and for all I know there may be a ""DA"" ""BR"" ""A"" lurking somewhere - but by now who cares? This is the sort of thing that seems clever to people who don't get out too much. Perhaps someone could re-edit this dreary rubbish to transform it into a real movie; cutting out (or dubbing with a human voice) any character mugged by Mr Jackman might be an excellent starting point.But I would much rather have listened to Cutter talking the illusion business over with Tesla -- especially on precisely how you deal with the blood and the noise when you smash a live bird on a table top or how you can produce all that Tesla lightning without deafening performers and audience with Tesla thunder.Is The Illusionist any better?"
" Well.
",,"If you didn't enjoy this film, well. You, I am afraid to say, have no taste in films whatsoever. I see people moaning about how they didn't understand the plot and how it was boring for them, that would probably be because you didn't WATCH the movie properly. It tells you from the very beginning to watch closely because this is a film that requires your full attention to understand and you will be well rewarded if you do. If not, you become one of those commenting with ""I don't understand, omg it's such a bad film because I don't get it.""The acting is amazing and the twist at the end of the film is not something that I saw coming. At times it is a little predictable, but all films have their moments and it certainly doesn't take away from the magic that it brings to the audience member."
" 23 out of 10
",,"wow. how did this slip so far under the radar for so long with so many people? the Oscars ignored it, audiences ignored it, i don't get how!!! the story has more twist and turns than if the usual suspects had a three-way with the 6th sense and se7en. the way you're rooting for hugh jackman's character then you're neutral then you're rooting for Christian bale's character then back again... it never stops!!! fantastic performances by everyone as well... bale as the better magician with the lousy showmanship, jackman as the man out for revenge who will stop at nothing to learn the other's secrets, caine as the man constantly finding out the type of men he's been dealing with. it just doesn't get any better. chris nolan you are a god."
" Over-complicated mess of a Nolan
",,"Christopher Nolan, the co-writer/director, loves to over-complicate his films a lot, especially in his twists in the endings, and counts on the simplicity of the masses to get confused and be called a genius despite failing to deliver in his films' ultimate goals: the twists at the end, because most of his films rely on those heavily to be given any meaning or quality at all. In this fairly long-running drama, Bale (as usual) and Jackman produce high quality performances, and special credit given to Bale's wife in the film and David Bowie (who can really act !); in an otherwise strong cinematography flick. The main issue is that the film builds up a great momentum, with lots of twists and turns, but as we're held in suspense for the grande finale at the end, lots of if not everything that's been mounted before seems to crumble as we discover the truth unfolded in the dying, yes *dying*, moments of this disappointment. It's like the end discredits everything that's been building for long chunks of Nolan produce, like the film shoots itself in the foot (or in the head ?). Too bad. This feels like a great, but it surely isn't."
" The movie is about more than the trick
",,"If all you read are some of the other comments here, you might think  ""The Prestige"" is a cheat and a disappointment. And maybe if you are  watching it with a superficial mindset, it is. But if you really pay  attention, and delve into the many layers of story, you will see the  movie as so much better than that.  Two magicians rival to be the best, and this movie takes you through  many years of that rivalry, along with the resulting jealousy, anger,  betrayal, and ethic and moral dilemma. Oh, and did I mention death,  disfigurement, and deception? The performances are gripping, and the  production is stunning, creating a believable setting that draws you  into the story. I did experience some moments of confusion when the  time lines jumped into the past or present a bit abruptly. But in the  end, most questions will be answered. It's important to remember,  though, that the most compelling question is not what was real and what  was deception, but rather, how far do you allow yourself to go to prove  you're the best?"
" Uncompelling, so-so script, poor plot.
",,"Like memento, here we have a relative simple story which by telling it either backward or through bits and pieces is supposed to become interesting. On the whole of course that never works for those with an imagination larger than that of an amoeba or for those that have seen the formulaic twist in already way too many predecessors.In the case of Prestige, to my surprise, there wasn't even a twist to speak of which really didn't matter much because the movie became drying paint already so much earlier, albeit in a nice shade of the colour blue.The story of Prestige is practically non-existent. But by telling it by means of flashbacks, tiresomely revealing spoon-fed bits of it, the plot and intrigue unfolds. Fast paced editing to throw in some confusion for good measure and some fake beards and fancy dress-up to, i guess, try to confuse the viewer on who was who and more importantly; when. Yet, as more and more of the story unravels, the more obvious it becomes that there isn't a story but more a collection of dreary facts. In the ""Usual Suspects"" for example, there was actually a compelling story unraveling while the writers worked their way towards the twist. Prestige only had some repetitive drama and therefore relied soly on the twist itself. Alas, many spotted the twist some 10 minutes into the film and it was hardly an earth-shattering twist anyway. I found no chemistry between the key-players and Bale and Jackman just lack any charisma whatsoever in their role (the keyword is magical showmenship, something they both lacked) and are therefore miscasted. Think i'm being harsh? Imagine either one of them playing the role of Eisenheim or Leopold, both charismatic characters/actors in The Illusionist.. I rest my case...The performances in Prestige were on par but the script was just too monotonous on too many occasions. On an even more annoyed note: Bowie was unrecognizable, Johanssen reduced to the human equivalent of a tittybar and Sir Cain to be honest, failed to impress but may have done this on purpose as a lesson learned from his literally outstanding performance in Children of Men. Another highly overrated film from 2006 in which his performance painfully made the acting of practically anyone else a complete joke.The cinematography in Prestige, though suiting the story and time in which it was set, was relentlessly dark which really was eye-candy but on the other hand didn't help the many plodding and derivative scenes.The only thing that made the movie endurable was the fine female company I was with, which provided the necessary distraction which made me miss some key-scenes which offered a bit of challenge to work it all out.I guess Nolan just isn't my kind of storyteller and his rather one-tracked stories not my cup of tea.4/10"
" This movie was OK
",spoiler,"I think Maybe, because of all the positive reviews on this movie.I couldn't wait to see it.My wife didn't like it.To many twists for her to follow.I didn't like the heavy accents,at times hard to understand.I didn't think there was much magic either,not like the illusionist.I thought was so much better.We never knew why he would keep using someone that screwed him so much or the girl either? It didn't make a lot of sense and the ending was sorta dumb.The guy got hung for something he didn't do. Oh well goes to show you don't believe what you read.I think the emphases should have been more on the stealing of secrets which was OK,And a lot more magic.One minute they were dirt poor next minute rich?I didn't like the hurting aspect of the grudge.ruin each other OK,shooting one not so cool"
" The best film I have seen in ages
",,"Truly the most original and stylish film I have seen in many long months, The Prestige is simultaneously intriguing, shocking, dramatic and dark. It's so refreshing to see a film like this amidst the rest of the rubbish that Hollywood tends to churn out at this time of the year.Beautifully shot, the film is visually stunning. The actors performances are all fantastic as well, and it's great to see Jackman in an unusually dark role - watching his obsession take over him slowly until he turns into a very unpleasant character was an interesting departure from his usual roles. Bale delivers a great performance as well.I won't expand on the storyline as many here have already done that, suffice to say that although they deviated somewhat from the original books storyline, the films ending is nevertheless well-crafted and executed.Definitely one to purchase for the DVD collection! A must-see."
" If this doesn't sweep the boards at Oscars night...
",,"Quite simply, THE best movie of the year (closely followed by Rian Johnson's Brick). Intelligent, witty, excellently shot (a superb mix of breathtaking pans and establishing shots and very involving hand-held/steadi shots), with the finest actor of a generation (Caine) and very likely his successor (Bale).No spoilers here, as unlike Memento,The Prestige's tricks can be worked out before they are revealed, and audiences will have great fun doing so. This is a tale of rival Victorian magicians, whose obsessions lead each into darker and darker places as Jackman's Angier seeks revenge for the death of his wife, and Bale's Borden looks to prove himself the better of the two magicians. Even without the mystery, twists and turns, this story is an excellent character study, something that carries the picture and at times supersedes the mystery and science fiction elements of the plot.Like Memento, it has a non-linear narrative, though not such an extreme one...the narrative is played out in three stages, like the magic tricks within it - first the pledge, then the turn, finally the prestige. It can be followed easily enough by anybody with a decent attention span, and reaps great rewards for those who follow it closely enough to try and fathom its mysteries. As with magic, the trick is not what has been done, but HOW it has been accomplished.Nolan is fast proving himself (along with David Lynch) the master of non-linear narrative film-making. His movies put the non-linear pretenders in their place (you know who you are), and shows that, even in this age of mass-consumption and dumbing down, movie audiences can be allowed to think, and don't need everything spelled out for them.Can't wait for Oscars night, if this doesn't walk home with a few (Nolan particularly, Bale and Caine) then there is NO JUSTICE!!!"
" Dark, depressing, plodding, ponderous, and unbelievably dull
",,"I much preferred 'The Illusionist', as that film at least had likable characters a viewer could hope would prevail, in the end. I've seen 'The Prestige' twice, now, and I think even less of it after the 2nd viewing than I did after the first. But, people seem to really identify more, these days, with characters that have no redeeming moral values, and are driven by their dark obsessions to the point of whatever-it-takes. A totally sad, sick, unsatisfying ending.Others have said that one has to have intelligence, and a healthy attention span to enjoy this movie, and I would also add to that, a true interest in magic, and how it works. Though the real 'meat' of the film lay in the personalities, I felt they were suffocated by layers of intricate plot weavery of how the tricks were accomplished, and if you aren't interested in that? this can be a very long watch. I have endured, rather than enjoyed."
" A film that cheats the viewer - and I hated it for that
",spoiler,"I'd been excited about seeing THE PRESTIGE, especially as it re-teamed two of my favourite film people from BATMAN BEGINS: the usually excellent Christopher Nolan, who delivered the excellent INSOMNIA and MEMENTO, and Christian Bale, an actor who can do no wrong in my eyes. Then what a shame it is that THE PRESTIGE turns out to be nothing more than a silly, muddled science fiction film masquerading as a serious and engaging drama.It starts off on a strong footing, with interesting characters and situations, but quickly loses these in a stupid plot that jumps all over the place and never bothers making much sense. The biggest kick in the teeth, however, is the ending, which ties things up with two plot twists that are frankly awful. The first is a sci-fi staple – cloning. What place does it have in a supposedly realistic Victorian thriller? It just turns this film into a fantasy and loses audience interest. The second twist is the one that's apparent early on, and one of the classic 'tricks' much beloved by writers of murder mysteries and crime thrillers. It's also been done to death and was outdated about a century ago, but no, it's resurrected here and had me groaning, feeling cheated when it appeared.THE PRESTIGE isn't a totally bad film and there are quite a few things to recommend it. It looks fantastic, and all of the electric special effects are tremendous. It also boasts a pretty good cast, with Christian Bale delivering another outlandish performance – his Cockney accent here is quite amusing – and Michael Caine presiding over things in his usual manner. Hugh Jackman I don't particularly like as an actor, and he's at best passable here; but in comparison to the hopeless Scarlett Johansson, who struggles with her British accent, he's Laurence Olivier! There are some fun minor roles for Andy Serkis and David Bowie, the latter playing the inventor Nikola Tesla and doing a good job of it. While the magic acts and tricks are engaging when they're on screen, it's just a shame that the film becomes so implausible and cops out towards the end. THE PRESTIGE contains nothing I'll want to sit through again."
" ""If your hate could be turned into electricity, it would light up the whole world.""
",spoiler,"That quote is from Nikola Tesla himself, it's not from the dialog spoken by David Bowie as Tesla. But I think it summarizes what is wrong with The Prestige. The action of the movie centers around the nexus where science meets illusion, which is a fascinating avenue into metaphysics, but in this movie, the science is little more than elaborate window dressing to what boils down to a melodrama about the all-consuming hatred between two illusionists the 1890s, Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Borden (Christian Bale). I'm not a fan of reviews that say what filmmakers should have done. Better to judge artists on the choices that they did make in the writing, casting, production, etc., and how successful those choices were in the finished work. But The Prestige is particularly frustrating because the Nolan brothers are obviously talented men, and I'm convinced that they missed opportunities both large and small.First, the science: Besides including Nicola Tesla as character, there are two stagecraft engineers, Cutter (Michael Caine) and Fallon (Bale, disguised, in a dual role). Neither, unfortunately, add much to the story, which, again, boils down to a feud which is so vicious that both men end up handicapped.Second, a rather glaring flaw in the script: Angier is determined to duplicate Borden's most phenomenal trick, teleportation, which can be compared to Scotty beaming people from Point A to a nearby Point B. Angier's engineer, Cutter, deduces that Borden achieves the illusion by simply using a body double at Point B, but Angier stubbornly refuses to believe that, which drives the plot off the rails for two reasons: (1) Less believable than any magic trick, ever, Angier is promptly presented with his own exact lookalike--Gerald Root, an underemployed and drunken actor-- which is preposterous, and disappointing except that it gives us a double-dose of Hugh Jackman. (2) Cutter was right about Borden simply using a double (his twin, Fallon), but Angier has gone to Colorado to find Tesla, whom he employs, and the great Tesla actually invents a kind of teleportation that is more fantastic than Scotty's transporter: it not only transports, it clones. While the subject remains at Point A, a duplicate pops into existence at Point B.A stunning breakthrough, no? But it's used as just another magic trick.In the end, more disappointment for the viewer. Angier confesses that his motivation all along-- the driving passion of his life-- is nothing more than to bask in applause, so the whole feud boils down to Angier's rolling-in-it ego vs. Borden/Fallon's consummate duplicity. The women Borden and Fallon love don't even know there are two of them. Ultimately, both wives end up dead, and a shared mistress (Scarlett Johanssen) is so manipulated and betrayed that she scrams. The actual climax sinks to a horror-film tactic, with clones of Angier rotting in water tanks under the stage. That's followed by a pat Hollywood ending, where the covetous Angier dies, the resentful Fallon is hanged, and Borden walks off with one of the two surviving females, his daughter. Another quote, one spoken in the film by Bowie as Tesla, suggests how good this movie might have been, if it had been more about ideas than emotions. Speaking as a scientist to a magician, he says, ""Perhaps you'll find more luck in your field, where people are happy to be mystified."" That is where a potentially fascinating film could have been found, in a story about how illusionists ultimately rely on science and engineering, and when the science is revealed, the result is the end of confusion and the dawn of enlightenment. Getting it completely backwards, The Prestige exploits science in the service of illusion and insane rivalry.Their subject was magic. I only wish the Mssrs. Nolan weren't quite so guilty of misdirection."
" excellent movie,must watch
",,this has has to one the best movies ever if not the best..Christopher Nolan is a genius..there is no flaw in the movie..the direction is excellent..Christian bale and Hugh Jackman have put in Oscar winning performances..the plot is mind blowing.. the movie is centered around two magicians with a contrast idea of what magic is and the two are driven by intense rivalry towards each other..each tries to outdo the other and even try to sabotage each others performance..in the end one becomes obsessed to learn the secret of the other's trick and he is willing to risk everything to obtain it.. the movie is filled with twists and binds the viewer.. all i can say is its a must watch..
" My Favorite Nolan
",,"Yes, TDK was unbelievably awesome. Yes, Inception was original and awesome. No, neither of them is Nolan's masterpiece (to date). That title belongs to The Prestige, at least in my opinion. Featuring an amazing pairing of Jackman and Bale, and the hot off of critical failure Insomnia, Nolan's movie scorches from the beginning. Putting Tesla in as a historical anchor was pure brilliance, and with the aid of Tesla technology most of the illusions they pulled off could easily be done, even the shocking ending(s). Therefore, despite what some might say, this is all entirely realistic.In fact, I think Nolan would be smart to re-visit Tesla and do a biopic, because there are few people as insanely weird and full of pure genius, in history, as Tesla was.On the surface, this is a simple magician versus magician period piece, but it slowly evolves into a battle of wit between two incredibly driven men. The twists in this movie, the first time viewing, are nearly impossible to predict (unlike Inception/TDK), and everything comes together perfectly. One of the most under-rated movies, ever."
" Devastating. You will be completely immersed.
",,"A lot of words come to mind upon seeing this again, and amongst them are ""brilliant,"" ""devastating,"" ""masterful"" and ""diabolical."" The Prestige, for those so shamefully uninitiated, is a pretty much completely perfect film, taking the viewer down a dark, twisted road of revenge, lies and deceit as two former friends destroy each other.There isn't a whole lot wrong with this, and when I said back in March that The Illusionist was better than this, I must not have remember just how good this was. The acting is spot-on, with Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and co. becoming completely submerged in their roles, and the plot is wrapped in a thick, foggy sense of mysticism and intrigue, with parts of it mixed and matched accordingly to build up a level of dramatic tension that most movies couldn't dream of possessing. It grows higher and higher, like Jack's beanstalk, until the ending, which will floor you like no other film has since The Shawshank Redemption or Requiem for a Dream. The Prestige, when you look back, will take something out of you that can't be so easily replaced. My highest recommendation."
" Not in any way a ""Top 100"" movie
",spoiler,"Too full of the current fashion: flash-backs, flash-forwards, twists, and turns. The main point of them in this case seems to be to confuse people. Well, guess what, I was confused, but that didn't stop me from figuring out the BIG SURPRISE that Borden had a twin about halfway thru the movie. here's an example of those giving it a ""10"": ""Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman give out powerful performances. I can imagine no other actors to portray these characters."" Whenever someone says that about actors in a movie, you know they cannot think outside the cranium, never mind outside the box. And here is more ""The film also features a solid performance of David Bowie, playing an expert in electricity."" Whoa. This film expert never even heard of Nikola Tesla. Hey film school dropout, he is a real person. Whether he built the first transporter/cloner/whatever, well, we'll leave you to think about that. What? Don't they offer ""Physics for Dumbies"" in film school?"
" Good acting, poor production
",,"I'll keep this short and to the point: The Prestige is an interesting story with pretty decent acting, but could have been much better were a little more thought put into post-production. Both Bale and Jackman played their parts quite well, but the flip-flopping of scenes between past and present were ambiguous at best and nearly every twist was foreseeable (if not obvious) long before it was discovered by the characters. For a movie about two magicians I would've expected the ending to reveal a secret I wasn't anticipating the entire second half, which for obvious reasons made the last hour drag on waiting for the inevitable. In short, wait for the DVD. It certainly isn't worth paying $10 at the theater, for the acting is decent but not outstanding, the magic marginal, and the eventual revealing fairly obvious. It is less a matter of ""who and how"" and more a matter of ""when"" they'll finally tell you what you've suspected since the first 45 minutes."
" Could've Been Great
",spoiler,"This movie had the potential to be excellent. Great setting, great acting, great potential for a twist. However, though this might have been easier to hide in the book, the ""twist"" was too easily foreseen. The first glance at Fallon, and I said ""hey that looks like Christian Bale,"" but wrote it off as coincidence. However the second time we caught a glimpse of this mysterious character, I figured out the ""mystery"". An undeveloped character with a beard, lowered hat, and obviously disguised? Hmm. I could tell his eyes were Christian Bale's from the start. And as the movie dragged on, with this character speaking no lines, it only proved the obvious. Fallon is Borden's ""double"" (twin) with makeup and fake facial hair. He is too underdeveloped, mysterious, and quiet to be anything else. And he just plain looks like Christian Bale! (minus the fatter cheeks from the prosthetic.) The clues stacked up too high throughout. How certain lines to Fallon were worded. His role in the family. The altering personalities of Borden. There was no surprise when Fallon took of the mask and shot his rival. So much for the crazy twist.Though there were some smaller more interesting twists, and the movie was well-done, this ruined the big surprise for me. Also, after developing this great theme of clever outsmarting of your counterpart through illusion and skill, the ending is left to science fiction? Sigh. I wish it wasn't real this time, I wish it was some good magic."
" Underrated and Underseen
",,"Along with INSOMNIA, the 2006 film that Nolan directed, THE PRESTIGE is probably one of his least known and least viewed films and that is too bad for it is a wonderful motion picture that proves he is a strong director with a strong vision.Dubbed ""The Warring Magicians"" film, THE PRESTIGE stars Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as two 19th Century Magicians who are...well...at war with each other. Of course, they started out as partners, but soon became enemies, each trying to out do each other and to discover the other magician's secrets.Cleverly written by Nolan and his frequent collaborator, his brother Jonathan Nolan - and based on the novel by Christopher Priest, THE PRESTIGE will keep you guessing throughout, trying to figure out ""how they did it"" and are constantly being surprised by double turns, back stabbing and second guessing.Bale, by this time in his career, has established himself as a powerful actor - and he shines here. Joining Bale is Nolan regular Michael Caine as the mentor of the two magicians, a young-ish Scarlett Johannsen as a a woman who falls in love with both of them (of course) and Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo as Bale's and Jackman's wives, respectively. But...the surprise to me in this film when I first saw it - and again when I recently re-viewed it - is the performance of Hugh Jackman. This film shows that Jackman is more than just Wolverine - that dude can act. As a magician, he is showing glimpses of being ""THE GREATEST SHOWMAN"" (but that is another movie for another day) and more than holds his own against a fierce Bale. Finally...special notice needs to be made to the actor who portrays inventor Nikola Tesla - perfectly cast in this role is Ziggy Stardust himself, David Bowie. It's a shame that Bowie did not act in more films for he captures the screen in the brief appearances he makes in this film.As for Nolan - he is now coming into his own as a Director. The action is fast paced, the twists and turns are ""honestly"" played, the composition of the pictures on the screen are interesting and beautiful to look at and I walked away satisfied.If you haven't seen THE PRESTIGE (or if you haven't seen it in awhile) - check this one out. You'll be glad you did.Letter Grade: A (and...that's a surprise to me, I figured it would be a B+/A- film)9 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (ofMarquis)"
" Nolan doesn't disappoint
",spoiler,"The Prestige is directed by Christopher Nolan and stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as two magicians that worked side by side until a tragic accident lead them to separate and now, they develop a deadly feud between them. This is a fantastic movie. One of Nolan's best yet again. Nolan is such an inspiration, he hasn't made a bad film, and I hope he doesn't. This guy knows how to make a film. The story was written by his brother, and Chris turned it into a film, just like ""Memento"". Christian Bale gives a great performance as Alfred Borden, a magician known as the Professor. Same goes for Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier. Very well depicted characters, each with a sole purpose. The writing in this film is excellent. Nolan brought the script to life with these nailbiting scenes. The death of Angier's wife was the point in which Alfred and Robert separated their friendship and became rivals. They then go on their separate performances and make new tricks. Some of the tricks would be sabotaged by the either Robert or Alfred, for instance, one scene where Alfred is displaying a trick with a gun, he has a volunteer. That volunteer is Angier, who takes the gun and slips in a real bullet then shoots off Alfred's fingers. That was where the violence started in their rivalry. The friction between Angier and Borden is very great. Hugh and Bale have great chemistry on screen together and I love how they got back at each other. The death of Borden's wife, Sarah, was unexpected for me. That was a mighty surprise where I was like WHAT?! Then, at the end, the plot twist was revealed, where Alfred actually had a twin who was his double. His double was the one that was going to prison and he was actually the other man, I forgot his name, who then revealed himself to Angier at the end. It was a very good twist and I loved it. However, there is one thing I didn't like. During the time Angier went to see Tesla, played by David Bowie, there was always a shift in seasons, where it snowed and then it was green again, and it was confusing to get my head around it, but that is all. Overall: 9/10"
" The importance of secrecy. Never think that spies are the best!
",,"A historical story line which demands a lot of attention to detail and art. Selection of the best in the class cast. Fantasy with realistic touch with scientists as characters. Salute you .. director. you did it well. I have a different view point for a certain point. I believe to keep the essence of the story 'importance of keeping secrets', you could have taken another mystical point to conclude the story. Like the live characters do not able to find out the secrecy even at the climax. May be for a commercial success of the movie, after that point, you could have indicated some points to the audience. Anyway the villain character's reactions to his false beliefs could not be captured then. But I believe, a person who sacrificed friendship & love (and many others..I cannot be a spoiler here!) will not do this at certain point to prove something to person who is no longer important to him. once again.. I salute you sir... a brilliant topic and a good canvas."
" Nolan's more modest masterpiece.
",,"Christopher Nolan's The Prestige tells the story of two rival magicians, Borden (Bale) and Angier (Jackman). The two battle over deceiving and outsmarting each other as they try to be the better magician. Spanning several years and often jumping backwards and forwards in time, The Prestige is a beautiful, brooding tale about obsession and how far it can and shouldn't go.Being one of Christopher Nolan's more modest films (being made between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and on nowhere near a larger scale), The Prestige is one of those films that only those who pay attention understand it's true greatness. With a typical Nolan-esque cast (Christian Bale, Michael Caine), the film is setup for quality cinema and does not disappoint. From start to finish you are fixated and deprived of attachment to the world around you much like Borden and Angier as you too do not want to miss any of the films trickery.One of the best things I like about The Prestige is how it deceives the viewer just as a magician would to their own audience. 'Are you watching closely?' a line which is repeated throughout The Prestige hints at the films very own nature. 'You want to be fooled,"" the last lines of the film as uttered by the legendary Michael Caine, leave the viewer in a bewildered state as they reconsider what they have just seen.The cinematography is grand. DOP Wally Pfister who has worked on all of Nolan's films I believe, deserves just as much credit as the director himself. From the dark and electrifying theaters to the eerie Colorado Mountains, The Prestige looks fantastic. Having seen the film several times and enjoyed each viewing as much as the next, The Prestige continues to amaze me. It truly is a mesmerizing and brilliant film which just cannot go unseen by anyone."
" Nolan's best? I think so.
",,"One of my most favourite films ever; 'The Prestige' is Christopher Nolan's most fascinating and engrossing film to date, pipping 'Memento' and 'Dark Knight', for me. The story of two rival magicians with a tragic history linking them, trying to outshine one another and the mysteries surrounding makes the premise of a magical two hour narrative.There ARE holes in this movie and the story is not as compact as some other Nolan films; having a few weak moments. But this is where the genius of Nolan comes in - he makes it work completely, despite those problems - which is why I rate this movie as one of his best directed films.This film doesn't have the heavy-handedness of 'Inception' (which is overrated IMO), isn't too clever for its own good (again, like 'Inception' and 'Memento' to an extend though I think the latter is Nolan's strongest in terms of sheer narrative brilliance)or the slightly impersonal feel of 'Insomnia' (a great film nonetheless; an underrated Nolan film I think). It is, in my opinion, the right mix of entertainment and quality. You will just not get bored with this film - in fact, I was left wanting more!The acting in the film is flawless and is what makes the film such a compelling watch. The entire cast is brilliant, without exception, from Rebecca Hall to Scarlett Johansson to Michael Caine. As the two rival protagonist magicians, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman seem to go one better that the other with each passing scene. Ultimately, it is Jackman who shines more as Robert Angier though. As the mentally distraught, obsessive but consummate showman, he pretty much steals the show from perhaps an actor who may, in retrospect, be superior in sheer acting quality.In a nutshell, 'The Prestige' is unlike any other Nolan movie. The sheer ""watchability"" value of 'The Prestige' beats the other Nolan movies blue and black. I have watched it four times completely; I enjoy it more and more each time. Without doubt, my favourite Nolan movie.Watch it; it is truly magical."
" Twisted My Mnd Like a Magic Trick
",spoiler,"In this movie about rival magicians in the turn of the century, the real magic is not found in the character's shows, but in the plot twists that director Christopher Nolan comes up with. Throughout the whole movie, the audience is taken on a blind roller coaster ride of things no one saw coming, yet somehow Nolan makes it work to where everything makes sense in the end. Along with great mystery that always keeps everyone guessing how the puzzle pieces of the movie fit together, the detailed cinematography of the secret behind early magic and interesting historic fiction of Nikola Tesla versus Thomas Edison add to the traction the film has with the audience. You will be left blown away at the brilliance behind this masterpiece and be craving more when it is over and done.When the first scene opens, the ""ingeniuer"" John Cutter explains the three parts of a magic trick; ""the pledge,"" ""the turn,"" and ""the prestige."" These three components run how the movie plays out, unfolding as sort of a magic trick inside of a movie about magic. Robert Angier and Alfred Borden play two embittered magicians, sabotaging each other's magic performances ever since Borden inadvertently killed Angier's wife while she was performing a water escape routine. Angier realizes Borden has a better trick than he when he unveils ""The Transporting Man,"" a trick in which he teleports between two cabinets. So the struggle of trying to outdo him as a magician turns this once harmless art (or ""the pledge"") into an obsession for Angier. The dark turn Angier takes in trying to be better makes the audiences lose what sympathy they had for him after losing his wife. Nolan turns the once protagonist into the antagonist as Angier begins to try and ruin Borden's life, including his family.Angier spends countless dollars and travels around the world looking for a way to beat Borden's trick. His travels lead him to Nikola Tesla, a non fictional character who was an inventor in the U.S. Angier convinces Tesla to build him a machine which has an unknown affect on Angier. The film does well in keeping the purpose behind the machine secret, hinting at what it does, but never really telling you. This adds to the secrecy of what is truly going on in the movie, with what the audience seeing only scratching the surface of what is really going on. As Angier descends more into his mania, Borden is frustrated that Angier has come up with a much better transporting trick than his own, goes to investigate Angier's secret. What he finds is when Angier steps into the machine, he falls into a locked water box and drowns; Borden is convicted of Angier's death and is sentenced to death. But, in another turn of events, Angier is revealed to be alive, taking Borden's daughter into his own custody. This leaves no more feelings of kindness towards Angier as he lets an innocent man hang and takes his daughter. It is revealed that Tesla's machine makes exact copies of people, which Angier has killed every night after his show in the water box. Borden is hanged, becoming ""the turn"" as he seems to disappear from Angier's problems. At this point the movie should be over, Angier has won and taken his malicious revenge, but it doesn't end. No, Nolan decides to break out ""the prestige,"" filling the audience with gasps and having their jaws hit the floor as Borden returns and shoots Angier. Throughout the entire movie, Borden has had a twin brother who has switched places with him with the other turning into Borden's assistant. The entire motion picture has been two plots at once, an amazing showmanship of mystique of the behalf of the director.The Prestige is a wonderfully dark movie of deception, obsession, and revenge. All of these things mixed with the secrets of magic make the entire film a trick, a mind game that twists the watcher's imagination. In the end, the audience in both the movie and those watching the movie are fooled into thinking things could be so simple."
" incredible, should be watched more than once
",,"Watching a movie ten times is stupid. Unless, of course, that movie is The Prestige. When my girlfriend asked me if I wanted to watch it again, I was more than happy to acquiesce. You may be wondering how someone's attention could be held after watching a movie so many times. It can be summed up, quite simply, by the fact that Christopher Nolan is a brilliant director. He manages to take a movie that has one of the most simple themes and build an intricate plot around it. The movie focuses on the competition between two magicians as they each strive for supreme success. Along the way, they each face the hardships of death and the slow decline into obsession with their work. In one of the most influential scenes of the movie, one of the characters is begged to give up his quest for greatness because it will only bring him sorrow. He, of course, does not heed this warning, but I will not go deeper into that to avoid spoilers. Along with the way Christopher Nolan developed a brilliant plot, he did an incredible job of casting his roles. Hugh Jackman plays one of the magicians, Robert Angier, and Christian Bale was cast as his competitor, Alfred Borden. Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie each contribute vital side characters and stories. Ultimately, this movie was created to get your mind thinking in ways that are very far outside of the box. There are some supernatural events, yet it is easy to relate to certain characters in the film. One of my girlfriend's complaints was that she did not know who she was supposed to like in the movie, but I think that was Nolan's purpose. He wanted the viewer to look at the film from all perspectives and not be fixated on just one of them. I don't even like writing a review for this movie because it is one that almost needs to be entered with a completely open mind."
" WOW! Just Amazing!!
",spoiler,"This is seriously the best movie you will ever see. By far, both Hugh Jackmans and Christian Bales best ever performance.I was on the edge of by seat the whole time. It is a dark and mysterious movie that draws your attention and is very intriguing. It may appear hard to comprehend but the whole movie is tied together in the final chapter and it is at that moment when you truly realize what an amazing movie this is.Possibly the best Christopher Nolan movie yet!! He employs many disturbing and emotive scenes to highlight the instability of the human nature. This movie has gone way under the radar. This deserves to be up their with the very best and beyond.I am not a fan on the average movie that entails little action scenes or movies that appear to take time to unravel, but this blew me away. It gets into your head and messes around. I watched this and for 4 days it was all I can think about! an absolutely amazing art work.10 out of 10. Enjoy!"
" a gorgeous film
",,"What sets Nolan and this film apart is the content of this film, not the acting (the only weakness being the Scarlett Johannsons accent, which is easily overlooked) and not even so much the story (which is also quite good). The story is okay, but what really took my breath away was the atmosphere (much like in Memento). He creates the perfect atmosphere for his movies, his style is brilliant. The shots are just gorgeous. In my opinion he is leading the charge in giving movie-goers a different experience; watching a Christopher Nolan film is a hugely different and a much more absorbing experience than nearly any other director. Well, for me anyway, obviously the experience is a hugely subjective thing.This film is special. There are no real good guys, no real bad guys, just human struggles with that hedging of the supernatural that really gets you thinking. His films are not perfect in that they don't fit molds or answer all the questions. That is what makes this film special, it draws you in and really makes you question things; important things.However, the important thing is that it is a truly absorbing experience, what more can you ask of a film?"
" This is the movie ""The Illusionist"" tried to be...
",,"""The Prestige"" is the kind of movie you wish will come after sitting through 25 other bad movies. Simply put, this is the best drama I've seen all year. Set in the late 1800's in (mostly) London, the film is about two rival magicians who continually ""one up"" another on magic acts. The film stars Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine. Caine plays the mentor of both magicians. The movie is shot out of order and sort of begins with the end. But just when you think you know how the movie really ends, it throws you for a huge twist. I won't divulge into the plot because if I do I'll spoil a lot of it. Let me just say this: I've seen so many movies that very, very few of them are able to surprise me at the end. This is one of those few movies. I was caught completely off guard with the final twist.In the first hour of the film I quickly realized that this movie is NOT the movie you've seen advertised in theaters and on TV. The trailer makes Bale out to have real magical powers and Jackman out to be the copycat magician. As it turns out, neither is true. (That is NOT a spoiler). This is quickly realized within the first 30 minutes of the movie. The trailer's deception left a sour taste in my mouth, but by the end of the movie you soon figure out why the film's trailer was so deceptive; it's all part of the magic. I can only surmise the trailer was so deceptive because they simply didn't want to give away juicy plot details and spoilers. And I'm glad for it! Normally I despise a film when it's misrepresented in a trailer, but by the end of the movie I had forgotten all about the stupid trailer.The performances were all very, very strong. However, it's Christian Bale that shines in this film. This is probably his strongest performance yet. (The 2nd strongest being his manic role in ""The Machinist."") That's right folks, he was nothing in Batman Begins compared to this movie. Anyways, don't be surprised if he gets some sort of nod from the Academy or the Globes for his role in this.This is the movie that ""The Illusionist"" tried to be. If you were left disappointed with ""The Illusionist"" (as I was), you owe it to yourself to see this magic movie. You'll be happy you did."
" Good Movie but not for everyone
",spoiler,"I just saw this movie and did have a good time watching it. I never felt bored with it even though it was a bit long. My wife loved it and I can see how some people would. It was pretty well put together, good acting, & a few good special effects. It did keep you guessing...almost too much. By the end of the movie I was wondering what the next 'twist' would be. Some of them you saw coming, some were not so obvious but it was apparent that the author of this story was trying to keep you guessing about the nature of good and evil and made it difficult to pick out who was good and who was bad. My only true gripe with the movie was the second act. After reading a review of the book I found that I wasn't alone on this. Some people will let it pass and just enjoy the movie but I couldn't. The movie takes a drastic turn to the super-natural (even though they half heartedly try to explain it as inexplicable science). Normally I wouldn't be put off by science-fiction or magic or whatever but this movie started off like it was based in reality and then just changed. If they could have created a plot device that would serve the same purpose as Hugh Jackman's ultimate trick without the super-natural I probably would have enjoyed it more. I think most people will enjoy this and if you're interested you shouldn't avoid it because of my comments. It was still a well done movie, it just isn't for everyone."
" Predictable and Contrived
",,"There was very little to enjoy in this movie. The characters were so unsympathetic as to create apathy for what ever happens next. The plot was predictable; the twists were contrived and silly.The movie itself, while very stylish and pretty to look at, felt forced. It lacks the smooth illusionist's quality that allows us to suspend disbelief and be deceived or dive in and accept the illusion. Instead it bumps along and tries to bully us into believing that we were just fooled.The greatest success of the movie is the creation of the period. The costumes, sets and scenery do an excellent job of putting us in the setting. Visually, the movie is excellent.Dr. Tesla's scientific solution is a horrible plot contrivance that turns a mediocre movie into a something worse. The result of the experiment fails to surprise or shock. The ""trick"" can be seen coming at us. Personally, I wanted be wrong and hoped there would be some final plot twist that would surprise and redeem this movie. There wasn't.This movie fails to come together. As the film draws to a conclusion, it is very hard to care which character will win. Both are reprehensible enough that it is just too late to care what happens.The Prestige is just frustrating to sit through for all the wrong reasons."
" Not as dark, or as good as it should have been
",spoiler,"Maybe I'm still bitter, because I was hoping to see a dark tale about evil magicians and, possibly, some wizardry. Instead, what I got was an overdrawn, dragged out costume flick that gave away all of its suspense way too early. Anybody, who can't figure this film out within a half hour needs to get off the Xanax and stop daydreaming. I knew from the start that there was no way that Batman killed Wolverine, at least not the way he was being accused. Like the movie repeatedly asks ""are you watching?"", all the answers are given quite early. When Borden's wife makes the assertion that some days he loves her and others he doesn't, that alone tells you there is another. I know I'll probably be ripped to shreds for my opinion on this film, but it's mine and I'll stick to it. And for god's sake what was Scarlett Johansson even doing here. Don't get me wrong, I love Scarlett, she's a great talent, but every scene she was in dragged, she looked like she would rather be somewhere else the whole time. I assume she and Jessica Biel have both sworn off magicians for life. The one thing I really enjoyed in this film? David Bowie. The man still has a presence that musicians and actors of today would kill for. One last thing? Was Edison really such an evil bastard that he would destroy any competition that came? I'll have to look into it."
" Great packaging... but nothing good inside
",spoiler,"I am getting a bit annoyed with the IMDb ratings because they regularly trick me into watching bad movies which have inexplicably high scores.This movie is actually well packaged, technically competent, with good acting (except for the always wooden Jackman) and quite decent from a story-telling point of view. I was able to connect with the story and the characters despite their flaws and I was entertained for the first hour and a half.The process of getting behind the scenes and trying to understand/figure out all the subterfuges and tricks that these rival magicians use both in their acts and against each other was quite captivating and carried the movie well, the ultimate goal being to try to figure out ""the transported man"". Several of the twists caught me by surprise and I was waiting for a spectacular finale but then Nolan manages to drop the plot on the dung pile by unveiling... the Cloning Machine! The whole story becomes meaningless science fiction drivel. Why bring in a cloning machine when he could have borrowed a Transporter from the Star Trek set filming next door and wouldn't have needed to kill all those clones? And think of how all the other magic acts in the movie could have been enhanced with a Gravity Inverter, a Matter Replicator, Invisibility Cloak...Once the story credibility falls apart the nice packaging becomes an empty shell and it can't save the movie from demise. Too bad, it seemed to have great potential... Is Nolan becoming the next M Night Shyamalan?"
" The magic isn't there...
",,"I totally agree with Berardinelli on this one. He sums the movie up marvelously when he describes it as: ""The Prestige is cold, and Nolan crafts a storyline that is more complicated than necessary"". And that is exactly the point, the film is so complicated it is almost impossible to follow, it doesn't make much sense, and is therefore not interesting for the viewer. It is also cold, without feelings, thus leaving the spectator indifferent to the proceedings or the final outcome.Subsequently, it doesn't matter any more that the movie is well crafted, in some instances well acted (especially Michael Caine), none of these things can change the viewers' overall sensation of disappointment in watching this film. On a last note, I do not believe the picture deserved any of the two nominations it received; just think about it, this film received a Nomination for best Cinematography and 'Curse of the Golden Flower' didn't...? I really fail to understand what they are thinking over at the Academy sometimes..."
" Ughuk
",spoiler,"Smarmy from front to back. All the principals are despicable. Nothing is visually interesting. The score is bad. It's slow talking, slow paced, slow to get ended. They could cut 45 minutes and omit nothing. Miserable lighting in most of the movie--feels like cavemen putting on a show. And why on earth would anyone pay the entrance fee when the light is too dim to see the magic. Magic isn't believe-able when it can't be seen. There is all too much of ""it must be so because the movie says it is so"" no matter how utterly preposterous it is in today's cinema -- Ocean's Eleven is another example.It's all in English but the deliveries are so bad that it is often impossible to make out what they are saying. Instead of shooting a scene again to get it right, they just write a repeat into the script so you can get it the second or third time it happens. Yuk---I want my money back. A Royal Nonesuch through and through.I can see why it is soooooo important to check the spoiler box on the review when the only reason to see a movie is to get a few moments of disgust at the end of the film when at long last the Scooby Doo moment finally slouches onto the screen. Please leave Scooby Doo to Scooby Doo -- he is so much better at it."
" What can I say, wow!
",,"What can I say, wow! I almost missed this movie in theaters. I looked at number of reviews and got a sense that this movie is about obsessed magician revivals, and how important professional life to those who care. Yesterday, while rearranging my Netflix queue I noticed to my surprise that movie is one of 250 best rated movies. So after short research I found one theater where movie was still playing. Movie certainly was worth the effort. It is somewhat similar to ""Usual Suspects"", but better since, I can much easily associate myself with magician then with criminal. I tracked at least three nested stories, it has absolutely unexpected ending, and movie is very logical if you analyze it afterward. Scarlett Johansson acting was average but other actors just took me there. I believed every word. If you can still catch it in a theater, go, and if not happy DVD viewing."
" Only good if you don't figure out what is going on
",spoiler,"If you are Perry Mason when you watch this type of movie (like I am), then you will end up figuring out the first half in the first quarter, and the last half in the third quarter. Which means you sit around for half the movie twiddling your thumbs as the deception goes through its motions.The movie goes from almost-plausible drama in the first half (she came out of the water dead with the killer knot still tied), to homicidal science fiction in the second half (I liked the kill-clone-self paradox better the first time I saw it in The 6th Day). I also liked the oddball scene editing better when it was in Memento.Good movie if the wool gets pulled over your eyes, boring if not. Good if you don't mind totally implausible plot devices (two magicians, one with a twin brother and the other with a random man in town who looks exactly like him), bad if not. Good if you don't mind Back To The Future-style scifi, startlingly lame if not."
" One of the Worst movies I've ever seen!!!
",spoiler,"How so many people can like a film with such a low quality of writing is beyond me. I am about to tear the film apart. If you have not seen this film, please stop reading now. The film has very good sets and the acting is well done. I cannot complain about either of these two aspects of the film. All actors are top notch. My big beef is with the logic of the storyline. The film starts off with a murder. Hugh Jackman is found drowned in a water tank after falling into it through a trap door from the stage above. Hugh Jackman is copying a magic trick that is done by Christian Bale does with his twin brother who is always disguised and no one knows he has a twin. Later, you find out Hugh Jackman finds a scientist named Tesela who created a machine that can create doubles of anything, but it teleports it nearby. Hugh Jackman uses the machine to make a copy of himself, has a trapdoor that falls into a watertank and drowns the copy on the stage and comes out from wherever it teleports him. His arch nemesis Christian Bale is framed for murdering Hugh Jackman and one of the twin is hung. That's basically it. Now, the tear apart begins. Is the secret twin is just ridiculous. He's going to spend years and years and years, dressing up and hiding his twin, just for one lame magic trick that didn't even do too well? Next, His twin brother is about to be hung and he STILL doesn't come forward and say he's a twin to clear his name. Plus, they were both with the same woman and she didn't know? Next, Hugh Jackman finds out he can clone himself. Bale can pull off his trick with just his brother. Couldn't Jackman just make like two copies of himself and do the trick even better? No, the dumb ass drowns himself every time for some reason. With two copies of yourself, you don't NEED to drown yourself. Not to mention, Jackman could make copies of gold or money, and he never does. Instead, the guy drowns himself over and over again because ""He's not sure who the original is and who is the clone."" I'm pretty sure the dude that materialized out of thin air is the clone. It's totally unbelievable."
" Sci-fi as a deus ex machina?
",,"I was told by several people things like ""This movie is awesome!"" and ""you'll have to watch it like three times to figure out what happened!"" Well, I can pretty comfortably state that the movie is not ""awesome"" and it only took about 1/2 the movie to figure out what was going to happen. I'm not quite sure why such talent agreed to be in this film after reading the script, unless they figured that most Americans are dolts and wouldn't realize how inane this movie actually is (which apparently is true). If you do watch it, and I don't advise against it because it's a better alternative than a lot of other movies, don't be surprised if you come away shocked not at the ending but at the way it comes about. For in this movie, I'm not blown away by the twist but rather by the ludicrous yet horribly predictable road leading to it."
" Roma Film Festival - the Prestige: ultimately unconvincing
",,"""The Prestige"" has everything a film need to be great: two lead actors named Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, for the first time together, a supporting cast including Micheal Caine and Scarlett Johansonn - I felt Johansonn was kind of useless here, though - and the direction of acclaimed Christopher Nolan. Still, it's ultimately unconvincing. Probably it will do big bucks, but don't be fooled by the current 8.5/ 10 user rating: the film's no masterpiece. Sure, it has its high points: great production values, with wonderful costumes and a gorgeous art direction - which succeeded in creating the visionary, sci-fi Victorian age that ""The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen"" tried in vain to create with massive digital effects in 2003 - . Most of the performances are strong; the best, in my opinion, is Jackman's. Bale is just a step lower. What didn't convince me is the script. It use a series of cross flashbacks which didn't always work well. The plot, very convoluted, is sometimes repetitive. The ""surpise ending"" is not that big surprise if you have paid attention. Even if its atmosphere of is definitely dark, with some brutal scenes, the Prestige is nothing other than a magic trick played to the audience: it will entertain you for a while, but will leave you nothing much. Maybe's my fault, but I was expecting much more. My rating is 6/10"
" A forgettable, mundane movie
",spoiler,"This movie was a moderate disappointment to me. From the beginning, it jumped back and forth in time, making it unnecessarily difficult to follow, and largely spoiling any potential to maintain a sense of suspense. This became very annoying after a while.The thing that I found most annoying, was the movie revealed its one surprise, pretty early on, and then kept waving it in front of the viewers' eyes again and again. To the extent that it was at all difficult to predict the gist of the outcome well in advance, that was only because the jumping back and forth made it a little difficult to assemble the pieces in the proper sequence.At the end, they did the obligatory sequence to explain to the audience what had happened, but by then, I was so tired of the anticipation for that obligatory moment, and so annoyed by the number of times that they had already revealed the ""surprise"", that it was annoying. I am confident that almost everyone in the audience had similarly figured it out, although most of them probably weren't as annoyed by it as I was.The only real surprise in this movie was David Bowie's performance. Not that it was a great role, but it was surprising to see David Bowie in this role at all, and he played it for all it was worth.This movie is being grossly overrated by the IMDb membership. It's probably worth the cost of a DVD rental, but there are much better movies to spend your money on at the theater.SPOLER ALERT: For anyone who is unable to figure out what I am talking about: from the moment that Borden appeared magically in Sarah's apartment, the story gave away the fact that he had a twin. That happened early on in the movie. The movie is about tricks and illusions, not about magic, so there is no way that anyone watching the movie could not have realized right then and there that Borden had a twin.The pieces of information that were spoon fed to the audience, could potentially be explained by either of two alternative theories. One was that Tesla had previously made the same machine for Borden, in which case Borden's twin was the product of that machine. The other potential explanation is that Borden had a twin all along. For a brief period at about the middle of the movie, it isn't apparent which of these possible explanations is correct, but the only reason why you are uncertain for even that brief period, is because the effect of chopping up the story is that you don't have all the information. But as soon as you are allowed to see just a teeny bit more of the missing pieces, you realize that Borden did not have a similar machine, and that if he had, he certainly would not have sent his rival on a quest to procure a similar machine. Hence, you are left trying to figure out where Borden's twin had been hiding up until the point when Borden starts performing the transported man trick. Even worse, you are left trying to ignore the sheer absurdity with what remains: Borden had sent his rival on a wild goose chase across the Atlantic ocean to visit Tesla in the Rocky Mountains, and by coincidence, Tesla happens to know how to make a transporter machine! ""The Prestige"" is a silly, second-rate story told in a confusing, chopped up manner, in order to confuse the audience, and to make it seem as though there was more to the story than there actually was. Will audiences ever wise up to this sort of chicanery?"
" I didn't buy Tesla
",spoiler,"Acting and directing are subjective issues. Half the readers here are already rolling out the Academy Award red carpet for Nolan and Bale while the other half have set the phrase ""cardboard carachters"" as F buttons in their keyboards. The problem with this film is not the acting or the directing. Personally, I enjoyed both immensely. Alas, the movie is absolutely flawed by one and only one thing which I will call The Tesla fiasco. Only 6 or 7 reviewers out of 420 point out that this Deus ex machina is completely unacceptable for anyone who has not been in a coma for the last 100 years. Only two years ago, a verified teleportation of atoms took place, and mankind has a lot more to go before Dan Simmon's farcasters are built all over the universe. So, a teleporting/telecloning device (and a flexible one, cats, hats, magicians)existed in the 19th century? What a letdown. Now, magic has always trusted and followed science to produce better and more wonderful tricks. Real magic uses real science. So, the Tesla machine, since it is science should definitely be a magician's secret weapon. But it is not science of the 1890's. It may be science of the 2030's, who knows. If, by a cocmic coincidence I had met Nolan, let's say, 3 years ago, full of enthusiasm about adapting a not so successful book to the big screen, I would have given him only one advice : Don't go Victorian. Set the film in NOW. Shoot it in US. Seek locations where quantum teleportation experiments take place. It would be far more dramatic, far more believable, and it would give you the extra little something that attracts critics and audiences alike. You could have won the world with this one and all you had to lose would be the Victorian costumes."
" Boring
",,"Wow. A ""huge"" twist that you can see coming down Main Street about an hour and a half before this slow moving, snore fest ends. And not only is the story not entertaining or surprising in any way - it's also long. Way too long.There is a good time piece atmosphere set, but who cares. ""Watching Paint Dry part 6 - this time it's water based"" may have been a better title.It wasn't all bad. There was a hot chick beside me. And the popcorn had a lot of butter.I am truly surprised that anyone found any entertainment in this film. I'm not sure if the worse part was the slow moving story, or the supposed surprise that in no way should surprise anybody. Somehow, the writers managed to make the story totally unbelievable in every way as well. Now, one may think that getting rid of reality would give the liberty to make an entertaining story - but they managed to avoid this. I guess for film students, and aspiring writers it may be a confidence booster in their own abilities."
" Nice movie, but the ""twist"" effect is growing a beard
",spoiler,"I liked this movie in that it's a nice story with interesting characters, beautiful imagery and decent actors. But like many other movies in the last years, this movie has a surprising plot twist at the end. In this movie I didn't particularly like it, and probably for two reasons. The first and main one is, the whole ""plot twist"" thing is getting rather old if you ask me. We've seen so many of these movies lately (The Sixth Sense, The Others, The Village, The Usual Suspects, Memento, The Illusionist, The Score, Unbreakable, etc. etc.) that it doesn't really impress anymore. Oh sure, it's nice to catch the viewers by surprise and say ""Ha! You didn't see that coming, did you?"" But then again, is it really that hard? In a world where the viewer is *expected* to ""suspend his disbelief"" and the writer has all the power to either show or not show information, you can make your viewers believe anything. In the beginning, or at least what was the beginning of this ""genre"" for me (The Sixth Sense, The Usual Suspects), it was still funny and unexpected. You felt tricked and kinda stupid when you learned the truth. But the more of these films you see, the more you realize how easy it is to surprise someone if you have absolute control over what information is or isn't shown. And, the more far-fetched the plot twists seem to get, which is the 2nd reason I wasn't really impressed by the ending of this film. It seems to have become a silly game among film makers much like the game in this film: a match to see who is best able to trick their audience, and who can come up with an even more insane plot twist. In this case it is insane indeed, or rather an insult the viewers intelligence if you want my opinion. Sure, just pull a proverbial bunny out of a hat by the end of the film like ""Hey, what about THIS then eh?"". Yeah, unexpected indeed, but cheap, really cheap. As someone else commented on this film: the makers seem to have worried more about delivering the best plot twist to date, than about making a good film, and executing the twist properly and credibly. Half way through the film, I was no longer really bothered by the issue that, at the end of the film, the plot twist appeared to offer a solution for. Part of this is because my ""suspension of disbelief"" had pushed the whole issue to the background. And part of it is because the film just doesn't keep you focused. There's so much other stuff going on that you aren't really sure what to look for. At a certain point I was waiting for unexpected answers when I didn't know what the question was.Nevertheless, I still gave this film a 7 out of 10, because in itself I thought it was a good story and I enjoyed watching most of it. However I do hope that film makers will invent a new genre and stop doing the plot twist thing because frankly, I think we've all seen how that trick works by now so it isn't really going to work anymore."
" Brilliant!
",,"When Christopher Nolan decided not to make the follow up to Batman Begins in order to concentrate on this, my reaction could be gauged as somewhere between disappointment and pathetic, howling cries of grief and anguish as I wept fanboy tears of despair. However, upon seeing it, I am definitely glad he did because The Prestige is one of the most enjoyable films from 2006 I've seen: a twisty turny epic about two rival magicians in Victorian era London trying to out do each other with more twists than a contortionists convention.The story revolves around two men: Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), former friends turned bitter enemies after a tragic accident during one of their shows. Angier is the showman of the two, a good magician blessed with the fact he's got natural charisma practically gushing out of his ears. Borden on the other hand is a man brimming over with skill and invention, but has a rather dull personality compared to his rival. Constantly trying to outdo one another, Angier discovers that Borden has invented a new illusion called The Transported Man and becomes obsessed with discovering his secrets. Unable to do so, he creates his own version and sets in motion a spiralling chain of events that can only lead to the destruction of them both...From out of this premise, Nolan creates an engrossing and highly enjoyable film. Jackman and Bale quite rightly burn up the screen, with Bale in particular going a long way towards justifying his reputation as one of the finest actors of his generation. There's a very strong emphasis on the spectacle of the magic industry as well, so to watch the two men performing their tricks is a riveting experience, not least of all when Angier perfects his version of the Transported Man and winds up travelling to the other side of a vast theatre in the space of two seconds. As with all magic, half the fun is trying to figure out how they do it, the other half is not knowing.Unlike real life magic shows however, it's not all fun and games because for all it's showboating, The Prestige is still a very dark movie. Angry young men have always been strongly characterised in Nolan's movies and Angier and Borden are no exceptions. They are both sympathetic, realistic and detestable in equal measure, each man getting multi faceted characterisations to the extent that it's difficult to know which one to root for. The only downside of this is that the rest of the cast, with the exception of Michael Caine's venerable old master, don't get such loving time devoted to them. Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife Sarah in particular is a very sad character, worthy of a lot more screen time given Hall's fantastic performance.Thankfully though, this is the only real complaint about the entire movie and isn't quite so noticeable on the first viewing when you get swept up in the duo's battle of wits amidst the fantastically recreated Victorian London. This confirms Nolan's reputation as one of the most talented storytellers in Hollywood today and is another glowing addition to his already impressive resume. And if the attraction of two men locked in a complex and vicious cycle of revenge isn't enough to justify a viewing...well, it also has Scarlet Johansson waltzing around in a skimpy corset. Try and resist it now."
" Real Magic...
",,"The Prestige is one of the best films I've ever seen. It is totally unique, keeps you gripped throughout and the plot is so clever and original. You don't see many films about magicians, maybe thats why I found this to be so interesting, and I doubt we'll ever see a better one. The film is not really about magic though. It is about obsession. It is about deception. By the end, Robert Angier (Jackman) is a magician for totally different reasons than when he started, and I think this quote shows his obsession not just to be a better magician than Borden (Bale), but to make Borden crash and burn. ""I need to know his secret."" ""Why?"" ""So I can do it better.""By the end, it is difficult to tell who you are supposed to be rooting for, because both main characters aren't exactly good guys, and I think this makes the film very unique. It is not about good triumphing over evil, rather it is about how you can get so caught up in one thing that it rules the rest of your life, and the dangers of becoming obsessed.The acting in the film is superb. If you went to see a professional magician, you'd see the showmanship and antics that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman perform in The Prestige. The special effects are fantastic, as are the illusions that are performed. Michael Caine is, as always, brilliant. He is still proving to be one of the best supporting actors in the business. Scarlett Johansson is also excellent.Christopher Nolan's direction is, obviously, brilliant. This is a fantasy film, and he has still made it look completely real. I also think his screenplay for all of his films, especially this one, is the best by anybody. Never does he just put things in front of you to watch. The non-chronological order he uses means that as you go along, any questions you may have are answered along the way, and this makes for a wonderful cinematic experience. I think this sets his films apart from other directors'. In summary, I think it's safe to say that Christopher Nolan is the real magician here."
" Top Notch!
",,"When The Illusionist ended, it felt like there just wasn't enough of the theme. Just how perfect was this movie? Period piece, great cinematography, great editing, colors, contrasts, actors, script, plot, revelation and it was all about a turn of the century magician. Here's an era that hasn't been explored much in Cinema. It got a 5 outta 5 from this reviewer.The Prestige gathers Batman Begins' two stars, Christian Bale and Michael Caine and thankfully forgot to include the dreadful Katie Holmes. So with the perfect trifecta of players known to work well together, Nolan adds another player, Hugh Jackman, aka The Wolverine. But the superb actor roster does not end here. Andy Serkis of Gollum fame plays the eccentric assistant to the even more eccentric real-world historical figure, Tesla, played by the best actor to play such freaks, and a true Rock God, David Bowie, who is barely recognizable in the his first scenes. And of course the feminine presence is filled by current Thinking Man's Goddess, Scarlett Johansson as the lovely assistant to our dueling magicians. You see the story isn't plain, it's quite complicated.Two aspiring magicians, are hired as crowd plants for the star magician's tricks that involve the use of spectators. Here's the setup. We have an aging magician touring around Europe and his trustee engineer Cutter, or ingénieur, as he tells the court, played by Michael Caine, brilliantly of course. There's of course the lovely assistant who happens to be the wife of crowd plant, Robert Angier (Jackman). During the preparation for the water tank escape, it is Angier's job to tie her legs and Alfred Borden's (Bale) responsibility to tie her hands. On one fateful evening, even after being told not to use certain not, Borden does so. The assistant unable to escape drowns in the tank. This drives a rift between Angier and Borden and in sue turns them into rivals; a vindictive rivalry that goes beyond the ends of science, physics and ethics.At first we see the sides of both magicians trying to pick up the remains after the tragedy. But always watchful of each other they will endlessly pursue the crippling of the other's life and career as magicians. Whether it's ruining the act or even using real ammunition during a bullet catching trick. There's nothing one won't do to one-up his adversary. When Borden comes up with The Transported Man, a trick where he seemingly enters a placard and comes out another one on the stage, within the time it takes for a ball to bounce; Angier is haunted with this astonishing trick which he can't seem to reproduce without using an actor as a double. This very trick begins the downward spiral into madness both men will experience. Angier's interpretation of the act is exposed by a disguised Borden. The event leaves a humiliated Angier with a very broken leg and with an empty theater.This leads him to sequester Borden's assistant for ransom. The demanded ransom is the key word to decrypt Borden's stolen magic trick book. This key, which is of course trickery, leads Angier to Colorado Springs to meet the eccentric Tesla facing hostilities from his own personal rival, Thomas Edison. This is where we learn about obsession and how it drives men like Tesla and Angier. Tesla believes he has created a teleportation device. But it has a few bugs that need working out. But Angier' is too eager to spend his fortune acquiring this device to bring his career back to greatness and finally defeat his nemesis, Borden.For those who don't know about Tesla, he is considered to have invented the 20th century. He created wireless communication in 1893 and Alternative Current (AC) and was the object of utmost frustration and competition to the better known Edison. Tesla was considered mad by some for theories about science-fiction worthy concepts, like a global wireless telecommunications network. Yeah he sure was wacky huh? Now I won't say much more about The Prestige's story line simply because it would ruin the fun. But be assured that this movie is great and parallels the brilliance that was The Illusionist but with the slight difference, that The Transported Man isn't a trick. And there are many, many twists in the storyline that may or may not be expected but only add to the complexity and richness of the story.Every little detail in the environment is taken care of as much as possible to transport the viewer into this magical world. Nothing is spared to make the storytelling as real and believable as possible, even in its most fantastical moments. Every major actor in this movie gives Oscar worthy performances. Not just one of them, but all of them. Nolan cannot go unnoticed this year for the best movie statuette, best writing, and best direction.If someone can reinvent intelligent cinema, it's a man like Nolan. He's proved it time after time. Memento, Batman Begins and now The Prestige.I will end this review here, for fear of revealing too much of its secrets. It would be like taking off the icing and leaving you with the cake. This movie must be seen by anyone who loves cinema that isn't packed with Hollywoodisms, clichés, gratuitous fireballs and puerile sexiness. If you haven't figured it out yet, The Prestige gets 5 abracadabras outta 5."
" Foreshadow of the bird
",spoiler,"In the beginning, where Borden tries to charm Sara, Sara's nephew would not cease to protest that the yellow bird's brother is missing (later shown smashed in its cage and dumped in the garbage). Although Borden shows that the yellow bird is alive and fine in its cage, the nephew persists with ""where's it's brother?! you killed it! where's it's brother?!"" (not exact quote). Borden's only reply is ""sharp little fella"" (something of the sort). I believe this is foreshadowing to Borden's true secret, hence his lack of a better explanation for the bird. Or perhaps it's all my imagination?? I also have the question of what did Borden supposedly lose as something dear to him at dinner (when he's drunk), if Tesla is not a secret but a disillusionment, then what is he speaking of??"
" One of the best movies I've seen this year...
",,"I went to this movie not completely sure what to expect. I knew it was directed by Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) and starred Christian Bale (Batman Begins, American Psycho), Hugh Jackman (X-Men 1, 2, and 3), and Michael Caine (Batman Begins). I knew it was about magicians. I knew it looked cool as hell. This movie blew away all expectations. The acting was first rate and the direction, par for Christopher Nolan, was superb. This movie will definitely exercise your mind with more twists and turns than all of M. Night's combined. The quest for fame and one-upping a rival becomes an obsession that makes for a riveting piece of entertainment. Only Christopher Nolan could undertake such a complicated storyline and deliver it so perfectly. Definitely worth the seven bucks and two hours spent."
" Style Over Substance
",spoiler,"It must be so long since there actually was a really good movie that people think this is a masterpiece. Nice to look at, well-acted, prominent cast, the welcome return of David Bowie, but too gimmicky to be a complete ""masterpiece"". Using the last 10 minutes or so to provide a series of lame explanations to attempt to redeem the integrity of this ""epic"" is not good enough. And is Scarlett Johansson trying to put all other young actresses out of work by appearing in a string of unmemorable parts in unmemorable movies? Hey Hollywood, give someone else a chance and save her for the next big movie where Josh Hartnett again attempts to justify ""actor"" as his occupation."
" A classical style thriller, but it misses the mark
",spoiler,"I don't like horror films, but these days, most thrillers tend to be packaged as horror films, so I was pleasantly surprised to see the commercials for the Prestige when it first came out. I didn't get to see it then. Too much going on, and more important movies to see when I did go to the theatre.I have to say, after waiting so long, I'm glad I didn't. I'm very underwhelmed by it.Hugh Jackman was a bit stiff in this, and that makes me worry, because I know he can pull off good acting. The rest of the performances were generally lovely, though.The flow was a bit confusing at first, but not overly so, and as time went on, everything was set in its proper time frame. But I do think people who like linear films would have difficulty with the first hour or so of the film.The sequences with Tesla felt like they should have been in a different story. Something more action-oriented. They didn't fit with the flow of the rest, really, and were only there for the big shocker, and to give Bowie his cameo. I would much rather have seen a growing thread of mishaps and attacks from each of them as Angier worked out the secret.The ending left me cold, and to be honest, rather ill. I think the writer sold himself short. Or thought they were writing an episode of Twilight Zone.Borden's secret was obvious less than halfway through the movie or so, and while it did seem as though at times they might have been working towards another explanation, in the end, it turned out to be just what it seemed.All in all, a vaguely interesting story if you're into stage magicians, or are fond of the actors involved, but not at all what it could have been, given the right attention."
" ""The Prestige"" is lacking it
",,"I'm a Hugh Jackman fan. A few years ago on a business trip to New York City,the hosting firm presented me with a top notch mezzanine seat to see him in the ""Boy from Oz."" Never did I see any single actor command a stage as he did. Hugh deserved every accolade awarded him. The show itself was quite good but Jackman was BETTER than the show. The problem is that this stage genius makes lousy movies and ""The Prestige"" proves it.First of all, it cannot compare to this years excellent ""Illusionist."" Not even close. ""Prestige"" was filmed in the dark--by that I mean every scene was dank, dark,ominous,creepy, crawly and downright annoying. I felt like I was sitting in an unlit cellar. The plot was highly confusing. The English brogues were as thick as mud and difficult to understand. The acoustics was awful. They needed Tesla like a hole in the head. All those top hats lying around ranked stupider than stupid. Novocaine was better than the usually brilliant Michael Caine. With all these doubles, maybe triples running around, I felt as if I were at a World Series game. Scarlett Johansson was just a pretty face and figure--nothing more. As far as I was concerned, the movie was nothing more than a jumbled up confusing mess unworthy of my time and money."
" It's not all that...
",,"Well, I've been interested in cinematography for the past 10 years of my life, I've watched all kinds of movies and I always seek the best, and please remember this is just my opinion...I watched the movie expecting something HUGE after all that hype, and I have to say, I couldn't be more disappointed, the twists were so clear from the beginning, the whole story seemed so trivial to me, it really doesn't deserve the hype or the high rating it got, although I couldn't say anything but ""Brilliant"" about the acting, that was the highlight of the whole thing, the directing was just ""Decent"" at most, and the make up was ""Horrible"".I gave this movie 5/10 only for the acting, the clothing and the decoration."
" Absolutely Brilliant! The work of genius! Do not miss!
",spoiler,"I think this is one of the all time best movies. I just happened to see it recently after I saw the first two of the Batman trilogy to understand the third, after I saw what Christopher Nolan had done with the Batman Trilogy! To remember each detail, to connect it so exquisitely, to utilize each character so perfectly, to show vengeance and yet to show humanity through vengeance and to create the sitting-on- the-edge-of-the-seat experience, is an act of genius. Be it the main stars Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, the ever-brilliant Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall, Scarlet Johansson, and Piper Perabo or be it somebody like David Bowie or Andy Serkis, the utilization of the role and portrayal of emotions be it anger, love, joy, intimacy or humanity is brilliantly crafted. Each twist is beautifully crafted delving into the details but not over doing. Although the story constantly switches between present and the past, the viewer is never lost as Christopher Nolan puts it all together so exceptionally well. The entire movie is built around the cool, composed but wizard-type portrayal of Christian Bale vs a 'plagiaristic' Hugh Jackman with the pure obsession of being the best and to do it the villainous way. Too bad that nobody won Oscar for this movie. But 2006 had some really classic movies. The Prestige is a must-watch!"
" The Prestige An Entertaining Thriller
",,"The Prestige is an entertaining thriller from writer/director Christpher Nothan the man behind films like Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and The Dark Knight. The Prestige is about two magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden whose friendship turns into an intense rivalry that leads them on a life long battle for supremacy. Hugh Jackman stars as Angier and Christian Bale plays Borden who also worked with Nolan on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. Jackman and Bale are great in their roles portraying men who are driven to be the greatest magician in the world. Michael Caine is fantastic as always playing Cutter a man who builds and constructs illusion tricks. Scarlet Johannssan is strikingly beautiful as both Angier's and Borden's lover assistant Olivia. She brings a lot to the small role she does have in the film. David Bowie also does a solid job with his role as brilliant scientist Nikola Tesla. The rest of the cast including Piper Perabo as Angier's wife Julia, Rebecca Hall as Bordens wife Sarah, and Andy Serkis as Telsa's friend Allie are believable in their supporting roles. Director Christopher Nolan does a great job with the period setting and the mood of the film. Even with a running time of 130 minutes the film is never slow which helps draw the audience into the story. The plot for the most part is complex but never complicated but does require a couple of viewings to full understand what the movie was all about. From the twists and turns to the superb acting The Prestige is an entertaining thriller that is sure to please anyone looking for a good film to watch."
" Outstanding, Beautiful, wondrous ... I'm running out of words to describe this awesome movie!
",,"Its surprising how a movie about 2 magicians actually managed to reach a producers table, but I am glad it did.""The prestige"" comes like a breath of fresh air, considering the mediocre fare, us moviegoers are being served these days and as usual Christopher Nolan doesn't disappoint. Christopher is quite deftly carving a name for himself among the best directors of this generation and has followed phenomenal movies such as Memento and Batman Begins with another masterpiece. There are not many directors who can boast of having their last 3 movies in the IMDb top 250 list.The movie takes on an unusual tale of the story of 2 magicians and weaves a poignant drama around it. Full of suspense and mystery. Without revealing too much, I would implore all you viewers to give this movie a dekko, and you will not be disappointed. If the suspense of Memento intrigued you, if the dark and poignant drama of ""Batman begins"" thrilled you, then The Presitge, will take over and take you to a world of envy, jealousy, suspense, drama and yes .. prestige.Enjoy!"
" Work of art
",,"Despite the similarities and the release timing, this movie is very different from ""The Illusionist"" in that it is more of a character study into very obsessive individuals as well as an adventurous, exciting and intriguing example of what film-makers can achieve if they really try.The performances are outstanding, the storyline complex enough to keep you guessing till the end. There are some really quite clever plot twists and surprises.Im happy to say that I didn't ""work it out"" until the various revelations.Very well made and thoroughly enjoyable; a thinking persons film."
" Mystifying modern film-making at it's very best!
",,"The Prestige is quality modern film-making at its very best. Christopher Nolan has proved himself to be a director to watch after his successful reinvention of the Batman series, and now this film; different in theme and tone to Batman, and for my money, much better! The brilliance of this film comes from many different areas - the acting performances and the professionalism of the film shown throughout go a long way towards ensuring that The Prestige is an excellent film, but really it is the story that makes this one stand out. The film is based on a novel by Christopher Priest and focuses on magicians in nineteenth century London. Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are magicians and friends working as assistants to another successful magician. Their friendship turns sour, however, when Alfred makes a mistake that leads to the death of Robert's girlfriend on stage. This leads to a fierce rivalry between the two magicians, and after each one sabotages the others' magic show; the rivalry takes a new turn as they battle to see who can carry out the greatest magic trick...The plot doesn't develop linearly, rather Christopher Nolan chops and changes the exact point in the story where the film is running from, and this works really well as everything always feels fresh and inventive and Christopher Nolan is clearly a director capable of handling this sort of feat. The Prestige features an all star cast, and all perform excellently. The male leads are obviously the main standout. Christian Bale has really proved what a great actor he can be over the past couple of years, and his performance here still works despite the fact that he sounds a lot like Grant Mitchell from Eastenders. Hugh Jackman is good also and he gets to show more of himself than he did in the X-Men films, while the likes of Michael Caine and David Bowie fill out the supporting cast. The cinematography on display is absolutely fantastic, and the film does an extremely good job of recreating nineteenth century London. The special effects are good also, and the scenes involving Tesla's machine are all standouts. It all boils down to a terrific and suitably mystifying conclusion and overall, I really recommend that everyone takes the time to see this film. The Prestige really is one of the best modern films I've seen in years."
" Clever, labrynthian mystery-thriller - with David Bowie!
",spoiler,"There seems to be a strongly defined split in posters' opinions about this movie. On the one hand, there are those who didn't see the two big story twists coming and thought the film was the best of 2006. Then there are those who did see the twists coming and felt cheated, just like audience who booed Bale's Chinese ring magic early in the film. One poster went so far as to say that because THE SIXTH SENSE kept him guessing then all came together but he didn't like the way the ending of THE PRESTIGE had to be explained by the narration, then the latter film somehow failed.I fall into the ""Didn't see the twists coming"" category (whereas I knew Bruce Willis was a ghost pretty much straight away in SIXTH SENSE).I'm afraid I didn't figure out Christian Bale's secret until it was pointed out at the climax of the film, though I did have an inkling of how Hugh Jackman's Tesla machine worked (the clue was in the hats and cats)But none of this matters. The real value of a movie is not the same as the value of a magic trick. Even if the film is ABOUT magic tricks. A film doesn't fail only because you figure out the twist ending. The journey is every bit as important as the destination. (And then there's films that DON'T have twist endings at all - are they automatically bad?) I know how the special effects are done in STAR WARS - doesn't spoil my enjoyment of the film one jot!No - in my opinion THE PRESTIGE is an ingenious examination of the obsession magic generates in its adherents where the entire film is a metaphor for the nature of performance magic.And it has TWO great twist endings. Surely, that should satisfy anyone?"
" Magic Show
",,"Antici..................................pation! ( With apologies to the Rocky Horror etc,etc.)The Prestige is the third act in a magic show where the magic is presented. (The first two are called the pledge and the turn)The basic premise is of two magicians at the end of the 19th Century who become mortal enemies over a woman. And, as important, their rivalry in search of the greatest magic trick. And naturally the dilemma of what you can lose when you want to win, damn the consequences. The protagonists are superbly played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, ably supported by Michael Caine and assisted by Scarlet (why her, again?) Johannssen.Bale who was the boy in the exquisite EMPIRE OF THE SUN (9/10) and, of course, the not so personable anti-hero in American PSYCHO (8/10) as well as the latest Batman incarnation, is growing into his roles. He is on the cusp of A list status and thoroughly deserves it. This film is like an exotic buffet; exquisitely crafted, beautifully presented with oddities and interests available throughout. Moody and electric, it captures the time and era beautifully. It is another feather in the amazing Christopher (MEMENTO (9/10) Nolan's cap. He's become a name director that you can trust with your hard-earned moolah.Especially interesting in reality was the whole story of the Edison/Tesla feud which was only touched on here. Tesla was basically the person who invented AC current and then was shafted by Edison. Watch for an interesting cameo appearance here. And Andy (gollum) Serkis in a non-digitized role.THE PRESTIGE was really magic."
" Never was a puzzle so amazingly clever as this movie....
",,"I watched this movie and not only was I totally surprised with the ending it kept me thinking about it over and over. This movie is without a doubt something to remember, something to shock you and something to keep you wondering. Not only does this movie show you an amazing story it keeps you wondering what side to pick and it makes you change sides over and over. At the end who was wrong and who was right? You be the judge while watching this movie. Great actors, great story, beautiful and very detailed scenery, a bit of history, a bit of drama and everything else you'd desire from a movie. Enjoy this movie and be sure to recommend it."
" Like the Nolan brothers? This is a must see film.
",,"A wonderful movie with a twist to beat all twists . . . everything I'd expect from the Nolans. I swear, I audibly gasped in the theater when the final reveal happened.Christian Bale is amazing and believable, and although I'm not usually a Hugh Jackman fan, I was even impressed with his performance. Creepy and dark, this movie is one of those films you just can pay close enough attention to--I can't imagine anyone having it figured out before the movie lets you in on its secret. I think that ""The Illusionist"" stole some of this film's thunder, and it's a shame--that film was nowhere near the masterpiece that this film is. I am waiting for this film to come out on DVD, just so I can watch it a few more times, being able to (hopefully) listen to the Nolans' commentary track."
" Different
",,"A very different setting, a very different story of the art of magic and illusions makes the movie a classic. Bale and Jackman fight it out for the top spot in the theatrical worlds of magic and trickery. And they weave a spell of magic doing so. i was spellbound in the entire movie, drawn into making hypothesis of how each trick was being performed, and they managed to trick me every step of the way. Both actors are geniuses and deliver a powerful presence on-screen. The dialogs are good, performances great but what makes the flick stand apart from the rest is the imaginative storyline that made me sit the entire movie, moth agape. In the end, when the truth is revealed, one is left speechless. words don't do justice to the film. A must see for all. A slow movie, but that adds to the beauty of it. A definite 9/10."
" excellent movie - a perfect clockwork mechanism
",,"this movie is excellent... the story is outstanding and the plot full of twists, yet there are plenty of perfectly fitting clues during the movie... acting is good too and the late 19th century setting is detailed and intriguing...While undoubtedly entertaining ""the prestige"" gives you a chance to think about the endless conflict between lies and truth or fiction and reality, stage roles and real life managing at the same time not to judge the characters and leaving to the audience the freedom to decide where good and evil (if any) stand...a ""must see"" for everyone, thought it would be wise to note that during the movie appear a few scenes that while not truly violent might be quite upsetting for a young public..."
" Greatest Twisting Movie since Fight Club!!!
",spoiler,"It's been a long time since a movie has captured my interest the way that The Prestige does. The prestige is a movie that intelligently motivates the viewers to keep guessing a simple and yet complicated answer. Like ALL of the most ""INCREDIBLE"" magic tricks ever to be performed there is somewhat of a disappointing secret, but nonetheless if you can keep the audience from ever discovering this secret, they'll never be disappointed. A lot of reviewers will say, the tricks weren't that impressive as if the answer was so obvious but I can bet that until things were made REAL clear those review critics would have never guessed it either. There was no real spoiler in this comment, but if you go and watch the movie after reading what I said about there being a very simple answer to the ultimate trick, you should be able to figure it out even though you might doubt yourself at the beginning. Still, you WON'T be DISAPPOINTED!!"
" Outstandingly good film
",,"This film is about the unscrupulous rivalry between two magicians, who tried to do everything to be better than the other.I have already heard that it is a very good film before I saw the film. Indeed, the film has not disappointed me. This is the best film I have seen in a long time! First of all, the plot is excellent. A story about magic is in itself intriguing. Coupled with a lot of very unexpected and unimaginable and yet realistic twists, this film leaves you surprised until the very end. There are many chilling moments, and many moments where the viewers are made to fidget in their seat because of immense suspense. When everything was unveiled and demystified in the end, I was in astonishment of the outstanding quality of the film.The character development is excellent. The viewers can all understand the cause of the rivalry, and we can all relate and sympathise with he characters.Acting is great. The set designs are visually attractive and nostalgic, and it can easily be seen that a lot of effort has been put into this."
" Nolan is the real magician
",spoiler,"Robert Angier and Alfred Borden have worked together since stage hands. Both wish to be the grandest magician, creating tricks that the world has never seen. Their friendship goes sour after Angier's wife, Julia, dies during 'the drowning woman' trick. Angier continues to build his act with craftsman Cutter, a designer for the illusions. Borden tries to crown himself as the greatest magician, yet lacks the style to drawn an audience. Borden and Angier's rivalry thickens after Borden performs the greatest trick 'The Transported Man'. Obsessed to know his secret, Angier is consumed to discover Borden's method.Angier is a showman. Style, grace and charm are his weapons. A magician relies on miss direction to fool us all. Angier is his own miss direction. His showman ship out reaches his craft, knowing his limitations and playing to that strength. After his wife death, revenge is his only driving force. He doesn't want to be the greatest magician, Angier wants Borden to know he will always be better than him, with no restraint to his conquest. Borden is no showman. Lacks pizazz and style, unable to make the simplest of tricks seem unreal to the audience. His hubris strains his progression, over confident in himself; but with reason. 'The Transported Man' is the greatest illusion beheld by any magician, he finally makes the simplest trick into the grandest of all; no wonder Angier becomes consumed with figuring out the method. They are each others opposite and equal, their antithesis. Their rivalry isn't one of brawn nor of words; they don't talk much after Julia's death. Their fights are of the mind, psychologically and game of wits to sabotage the other.Obsession and identity crisis is deeply explored through out The Prestige. Stated by Cutter, you can't be afraid to get your hands dirty. Though this is not about the death of a little bird for the sake of a trick, lives are torn and destroyed over two mens bitterness. Obsessed with each other, Angier and Borden's original identities are unrecognisable, with those they hold dear holding the brunt of each ones torture. The real magician of this act is director Christopher Nolan. Like a magician, Nolan draws us in nice and close. Cinematography by Wally Pfister, our view of the periodic time is confined and constricted. Our surroundings are blinded by whats happening. Smoke and mirrors, miss direction utilising the non linear time sequence, confuse us from what we are meant too see. Nolan is gifted with his craft as a film maker, playing with the audience. Offering his pledge, creating the turn, then the prestige of the final act, where the revelation finally emerges.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as Angier and Borden respectively, are both amazing. Jackman greatly evolves with Angier from a man of craft, to a man torn of revenge and obsession. Bale perfectly shows Borden torn between his love and his love of magic. Michael Caine shows his talent and perfect as Cutter. David Bowie is a real stand out in his minor role as Tesla. Scarlett Johansson wraps beauty and talent nicely.The Prestige is one film that is simple magic. Another mile stone from Nolan."
" Well now, this is a rare case
",,"Typically, if there is a book and then a movie, the book is the better by far. Enter Christopher Nolan, and this is no longer the case.As two friends' different philosophies on magic set tensions in motion, it is a tragic death that forever puts a wedge between them. A rivalry ensues between the more penetrating Borden (Bale) and the showman Angiers (Jackman). With three different time lines moving all at once through most of the movie, there's really never a moment's boredom. This storytelling is efficient and compelling.There is enough foreshadowing throughout the movie to make one giddy. I loved how Nolan chose to focus much more on Borden's personal life than Priest did in the novel. All of the developing back story is gone, but what is gained is worth it in my opinion. Borden's wife, played by Rebecca Hall, was an unexpected treat. She certainly out-performed the other female lead. . .At times, the movie was a little too enunciated, my reason for giving it a 9 and not a 10. Just a little more faith in the audience, especially at the very end, would have been nice.As always, Bale was perfect. Cane was able to really shine as well, especially when reprimanding Angier at the end of the movie. A real surprise though was Hugh Jackman. Of X-Men and Kate and Leopald fame, I was more than worried for his quality of performance in this movie. Thankfully, there was never any reason to be, however. It wasn't till the very end when perhaps he was just a little too over the top (and he kind of earns it) that I thought, ""Wait, that's Hugh Jackman. Oh dear, good for him."" Never for a second was I ever tempted to think of Wolverine or elevators.Splendid entertainment."
" An interesting movie, but really not that surprising
",,"After seeing the movie, I was surprised by the number of 8, 9, and 10 stars that people gave it, saying things like it was ""the best movie of the year"". I must disagree. This is a movie worth watching for entertainment's sake, since individual aspects of the movie are top notch, but overall I would leave movie of the year to something like The Departed instead.Pro's:1) Very good acting 2) Unique plot 3) Nice effects, especially when you see how magic ""really"" gets done 4) Believable characters -you definitely empathize with both main characters, despite their treachery 5) Extremely tight plot. It brings to mind the Harry Potter books, actually - every little detail is important and plays a role. Things that you are think are periphery turn out to lead you to the conclusion. Good foreshadowingCon's:1) So, so so predictable. I was shocked that people were surprised by the ending 2) Inconsistent idea. This movie tried to be about two things. It wanted to be about the plot twist/rivalry, but it also had a theme in the age-old ""is there magic"" question. As stated in the previews and other reviews, there're some surreal sci-fi aspects to the movie. This was very disappointing. 3) There are a few irritating inconsistencies that just make it hard to suspend belief and get into the movie. I won't put any spoilers here - but suffice it to say the movie lost cohesiveness in anything involving sci fi or the final twist.4) The flash-forward flash-back nature of the story telling did not add anything to the mystery of the story - it just leaves you irritated and confused for the first 20 minutes (who is reading whose diary again? Is this before or after the last thing that happened? etc)All in all, the plot was very well constructed and the idea was great. In general the acting was good and it was well directed. It was just missing that extra ""oomph"" that turns and interesting movie into a fabulous one. There was something a little too predictable about all of the plot twists, and something a little inconsistent about the theme of the movie that prevented me from really praising it."
" One of the worst movies ever
",,"It's the longest movie I've ever sit through, it felt like 9 or 10  hours at least. Nothing interesting happens, it's a story so convoluted  and stupid written only to get to the last ""shocking reveal"" that  ANYONE with half a brain would expect coming since the introduction  Caine gives about a magic trick. I wonder just how can Hollywood  believe that people are still impressed or interested in this ""usual  suspect"" trickery: come up with something else already, we don't need  to be ""fooled"", we can take a good narrative that doesn't try to  outsmart us (specially when it doesn't like in the Prestige).  And then that reveal is even dumber than you could ever imagine, not  that you wouldn't see it coming at least 30 minutes ahead, it's just  that you would hope that it's not THAT stupid and that the  writer/director would respect the audience and give something credible  or at least smart. No luck with that.  Anybody that loves movies should stay away from this crap, I'm just  glad I didn't pay to see it, but I'm sad about wasting a couple of  hours of my time with it. Save yours, go see anything else, avoid at  all costs, it is worse than Al Quaeda."
" Oh what a tangled web...
",,"When I left the cinema after watching 'The Prestige', I tried to make head or tail of its storyline and eventually had to give up. This movie is a hotchpotch of unclear situations, flashbacks, mysterious allusions to the extent that in the end nothing makes much sense. Some of the comments on this website did help clarify a number of issues, but in the end the tortuous plot and the all-too-frequent twists and turns had me throw in the towel. It is to be regretted that, in order to ensure the success (?) of a movie, film directors have to resort to irritating 'postmodern' techniques requiring an above-average IQ and a PhD in cinema studies. Oh, for the simplicity and directness of 'Snowwhite and the seven dwarfs'! Among the many unresolved issues, one detail continues to exercise my mind: what is the significance of the small red ball which continues to be thrown at some of the characters and is then thrown back to the sender?"
" No-go
",,"Anyone with taste shouldn't attend a film with either Jackman, Johansson, or Bale, or directed by Nolan. Anyone with a brain would have seen the end coming an hour before the end comes. Chopped-up editing. Confused narration. Historically inaccurate. Very long. Boring cinematography. Studio movie 100 percent. Something has to blow up every 5 minutes to please the audience. The makers don't know if they're directing fiction or historical period piece. Maybe the only thing to save from the film is Bowie, walking through the screen like an alien-life form, with the same distinctive walk we have seen so many times in films (Twin Peaks, the Man Who Fell to earth, ...). David Lynch once wanted to make a film about Nikola Tesla, and Nolan asking Bowie to be him is maybe a nod to the project, but sadly it fails to portray anyone, or anything, in a convincing manner...And all this looks like it's been done and seen before a thousand times."
" Let's watch middle-aged men talk for 2 hours! That sounds SO fun!
",,"There is something Quentin Tarantino always says that I couldn't help apply to The Prestige. In a lot of interviews, he mentioned that most movies anymore aren't even stories, but rather a single circumstance that the director just lives up to for two hours. And that's exactly the problem The Prestige and every other Nolan film has. Nolan just takes one boring concept, then attempts to stretch it out into a long-winded, boring movie by use of his watered-down metafiction directing style. If The Prestige would have been the idea of any other director, they would have at least added SOMETHING to the one-track story or cut it down to half the time so it would have at least been slightly less tedious to sit though.The Prestige opens up with the single least interesting first hour I've ever witnessed in a film. Is there anything whatsoever that was even remotely meant to hold my attention? From the severely uninteresting opening, the movie tries hard to redeem itself with a middle ""twist"" that is too shallow to be called a true plot twist. Simply put, it's a weird sci-fi insert and nothing more. I have nothing against that, but one semi-interesting plot point can't save a pointless movie from being pointless. By the predictable ending, all the scenes that made no sense before make sense. I assume this is a style Nolan finds clever, but it got old after Memento. In The Prestige it's simply annoying, if not a bit childish. It's used here as a way to force an uninteresting plot into something that is watchable by indulging the viewer in cliché mystery. And I predictable and analyzed everything I just said above in the first ten minutes alone. Ironic, isn't it, that Nolan tries so hard to unpredictable but the very storytelling method he uses gives himself away. Christopher Nolan is a lot like an immature little kid trying to impress an old magician with a cheap coin trick. It's amusing and cute at most.The other main problem with The Prestige is it lacks anything whatsoever even slightly original. The one-line plottwo dueling magicianshas been used in everything from multiple CSI episodes to cartoons like Scooby Doo to old classic horror Hitchcock Presents episodes. The sci-fi insertI won't spoil what it ishas been done before in other movies time and time again. The dramatic scenes are all as cliché and predictable as possible. All the fanboys who are calling The Prestige even remotely original really make me laugh.The acting is decent on all fronts, and sometimes borders on cheesy when some of the actors forget their accents half-way through. The directing is somewhat stylish, but nothing that held my attention or is anywhere above average.But above all, the main flaw is by far the fact that 2/3rds of the entire movie is irrelevant to the plot or to anything whatsoever. It's just a bunch of old men repeating the same lines about magic tricks over and over to the point of nausea. I don't have the strongest attention span, but I can certainly sit through a slow-paced movie when the slow pacing actually has something to do with the story. For example, the original 1970s Alien had a complete hour of seemingly irrelevant screen time, but it used that to build atmosphere. Here, in The Prestige, you have an hour and a half of screen time devoted to nothing but hearing old men talk about things that make no difference. It doesn't build atmosphere; it bores. I was already screaming, ""Does it EVER end?"" at the screen before I was even halfway through, and that is simply ridicules.Overall, The Prestige is a completely pointless watch because you've seen it all beforein half the time. It's cliché, painfully boring, and ultimately pointless: all staples of Christopher Nolan's film making.0/10"
" Confusing, idiotic, and pointless.
",spoiler,"Before I forget: Somebody said this was the best twisting movie since Fight Club. Honestly, must you make such a pointless comparison? Not only was Fight Club a hundred times better than this movie, the only thing it shares is the fact that people look like other people. Deal with it.I thought it could be a good movie - but then, of course, I watched it. This was a chance to make something great. It had good acting, famous actors, pretty cinematography and and a pretty neat premise about Tesla and his magic electricity/ duplication machine stuff. It failed, though, rather miserably. Now, it would have been a good movie, had it been muted, all the death and violent scenes, cut out, and simply been a showcase of interesting shots and pretty colors. And, of course, Tesla' cloning machine. In fact, the premise of the movie was pretty stupid. Seriously, there was no reason to make them magicians at all. Anybody can kill people, it just provides more interesting deaths if they can drown people in tanks or have people shot with their own guns. Take a hint from Pan's Labyrinth. Just grab the other guy and stab them in the face outright. It was confusing throughout. I eventually got it, but I had to pause the movie a few times. I'm not stupid, it was just so unexpectedly confusing I had to pause and think. Okay, so some guy called Angier drowns in a tank. The other guy, Bordon, goes to jail, and reads the dead guy's journal. The bits from the past switched between the dead guy reading the diary of the guy in jail, and the events leading up to him getting the diary. Both the past and present have a lot of unneeded jumping around all over the place, and in between all of that, the magicians end up hurting and killing a bunch of random people. They steal each others tricks, most notably the ""Transporting Man trick"". Eventually, Angier finishes reading Bordon's diary which ends with something like ""I KNOW YOU HAVE THIS, I GAVE IT TO YOU ON PURPOSE. MWA!"" As Bordon finishes reading Angier's diary, he gets a similar message. Finally, the movie confesses outright (although it hinted throughout) that Angier had created doubles that died every time, and as actually alive, (he most likely framed Bordon) and he steals Bordon's daughter for revenge and Bordon prepares to be hanged. Cutter refuses to let Bordon be hanged, but then doesn't care that Bordon (who had a double; one always posed as his agent. this is also how he did the transporting man trick.) gets the happy ending because he shot Angier, who made a ridiculous speech about how he never wanted Bordon's trick and just wanted to 'see the audiences' faces'. ""OMG, they clap for me! Must kill more people!"" After Bordon shot Angier, Cutter should have shot Bordon. Then they would have both gotten what they deserved. Except poor little girl would be all sad with no father. Cutter wouldn't want that.Oh yes, and one of the Bordon's loved Emily, their wife, and the other loved Olivia. Emily got mad because of the ""affair"", if you could even call it that, and so she hung herself. Rather stupid if you ask me.Speaking of the deaths, I thought the whole ""Oh noes, Angier's wife is dead"" thing to be idiotic. It started the whole stupid story. Throughout the whole movie, Bordon repeats ""I don't know which knot I tied."" Wow, I think you would, considering you specifically changed your frigging mind about what you were tying halfway through. I mean, seriously.What's wrong with you people? Get over it! I mean, seriously, you can't be that crazy obsessed, since the movie didn't mention the origin of this insane obsession. Oops. Never mind. Bad move, Nolan.The only reason this deserves a three is because of the actors, the cinematography, and the fact that it made me mad enough to slap everyone involved. Except David Bowie, because, in all honesty, the Tesla parts were all pretty cool in premise. They should have made the movie all about him. Three Cheers for ""Tesla: The Movie"".Was I really the only one who thought Scarlett looked a bit like Keira Knightley?"
" Just BAD!
",spoiler,"(Contains no real spoiler, but could prompt a naive viewer to draw conclusions prematurely.) The intrigue of magic, what invites people to suspend disbelief for a moment, is the realization that the trick never IS supernatural; completing it doesn't require the violation of laws of physics, although all one's senses tells you it must.This movie, although beautifully composed and photographed, relies on sci-fi stunts to carry the story, which I think cheapen it and preclude it from being brilliant, even clever.Also, using the analytical tool of working backward from the ending to determine the likelihood of the events that preceded it, there are a number of problems with the story. Apparently, these magicians could not only conjure up illusions, but could also read minds and foretell the future.A big disappointment. . ."
" The real mystery is the praise this film received
",,"Christopher Priest's novel novel on which the film was based is to my mind by far the least interesting of his that I have read. It's reliance on impossible, rather than speculative, science making it ever so slightly ridiculous to this confirmed rationalist. The best feature of the book by far was the complicated narrative methods it used. Needless to say this is totally lost in Nolan's tricksy film. The narrative here is disjointed, not for any obvious effect, but seemingly because this is now Nolan's style, a style he will use regardless of how appropriate it is to the film. What we end up with though is an uninteresting tale badly told, devoid of humour or life. Christian Bale is as mannered as ever, after several films in which he got to use his unconvincing American accent he now sounds equally unconvincing as a cockney. Hugh Jackman is slightly more watchable but Scarlett Johannson is wasted and Bowie as embarrassing as ever. Watching this back to back with the less feted ""The Illusionist"" is instructive, that film was as predictable and old fashioned as could be, it was at least entertaining and Edward Norton runs rings round Bale."
" A very well told story despite the lack of shine in the final reveal (spoilers)
",spoiler,"Magician Alfred Borden is on trial for the murder of fellow magician Robert Angier, allegedly by positioning a lockable tank of water below a trap door that Angier fell as part of a trick. With the prosecution pushing for the death sentence, Cutter, experienced mentor to both men, relates the history between the two men. Starting as friends working as plants to support an established magician, their friendship turns into professional rivalry at first but a tragic accident sees the two enter a personal battle.Like everyone else, I want to be liked. I want people to think good of me and perhaps respect me; I don't think it is an unnatural thing and, no matter what they say, most people feel the same. However I have never pandered in my opinion to the majority voice and the IMDb's ridiculous ""was this comment useful"" voting system will not deter me from questioning why this film is so highly thought of. On one level I can see why because it is a masterful piece of story-telling that weaves flashbacks within flashbacks as easily as moving between concurrent scenes set in the present (whenever that is in regards the narrative). In doing this it doesn't produce confusion as to when we are but rather makes the story much stronger and deeper. Nor did I have a problem with the sci-fi ideas being put into Victoria times; no, although the ""cloning"" machine is a jump, it is only a jump because my head is stuck in the period and not accepting such an idea as I would in another film.No, the problem I had with it was the build up to an ending that I had to spend a lot of time thinking about. I didn't think so much because I didn't get it  I thought about it because I didn't think it would be so straightforward (in sci-fi terms of course) and predictable. The boards are full of debate over whether the machine works or not, but I think that the reason for this is that many are keen to find a twist and trick that isn't really there. This was a letdown for me and the delivery of the final scenes suggested that I should be taking it as a twist or surprise, but really it isn't. To me this stops it being as good as everyone else seems to think it is, but I still can see the strengths that kept it interesting for two hours.As said the story-telling is very strong, even if the conclusion isn't all I would have liked. Visual themes (clues?) are run throughout the film in a way that isn't clear until after the plot becomes clear. Ahead of this stuff though, is an engaging story in regards the characters, which was what drove the majority of the film for me. The flashback structure compliments the narrative well and produces characters sucked under by envy, hate, bitterness. With this to work with both Jackman and Bale give strong performances that really drew the script out and made this aspect so interesting to me. Caine is a class-act as he often can be but some of the other casting is questionable. Serkis I have no problem with in a minor role, but Bowie is always a risky prospect (see Fire Walk With Me for proof  or rather lack of proof since he was cut down to a minimum to the detriment of the film). Here he isn't terrible but he certainly isn't any good. Johansson I'm not sure about as an actress. She is pretty as a young woman but her acting isn't always up to scratch and here she is pretty average at best.Overall then, not as brilliant as everyone would have you believe because the conclusion is nowhere near as strong (or surprising) as the delivery and build-up within the film would suggest (far less the gushing praise and theorising herein). The manner of telling is masterful though and works so well that perhaps it accounts for my problems late in the game. The lead pair respond well to this, both turning in very strong performances. A very good film then, just not as wonderful and flawless as the praise on this site would have you believe."
" Not so much of a magic trick, just a flight of the imagination... maybe.
",spoiler,"Okay, well I'd been looking forward to this movie, the premise sounded great, Victorian magician's competing with each other for the 'trick they'll be remembered for'... I've got time for the entire cast, and in my opinion they pretty much all turned in great performances... but i'm still a little unsure of how worthwhile this movie really is.*spoilers*so, the movie seems to centre itself around a clever trick 'The Transported Man' - which, although at points is described as nothing more than an illusion created with a magicians double, it's also suggested that Nikola Tesla invented a machine that would not just duplicate objects.. but would perfectly duplicate PEOPLE?!okay, i'm of two opinions, either:A) the machine doesn't work = a clever, ingenious movie that i've yet to fully suss.or B) the machine does work = a naff work of fiction that pivots on an, as yet, impossible piece of technology.now aside from the mass of arguments going on in the forums, i'm lead to believe that Nolan has created a film with a *working* machine, this is nothing new, many a hopeless whodunit has cropped up an impossible-to-figure killer in the final real. or, like the prestige, has relied on some bit of gadgetry that turns the entire reality of the movie into a farce... Scream3 springs to mind with the 'voice changer' that'll change anyone's voice into anyone else's.it's about magicians... normal people, creating something mystical, with no more than skill and misdirection... whereas this movie has a normal man, creating a truly mystical effect, with a hugely preposterous work of fiction... if he can invent a 'duplicating' machine back in the Victorian times, then why not just have all the magicians as wizards as well, if you're gonna leap into fantasy, then leap with your whole being, not just plop it in at the end as a silly fix-it.here's hoping someone makes a movie of 'Carter Beats The Devil' instead, set around the same time, with a far more plausible storyline, and characters you really learn to care about.then again, if Nolan comes out in 5 years time and explains to us how the movie works with a *non-working* machine, then all is forgiven, and this is a damn good movie..... but until that day... 3/10"
" Crap Covered Pretzel with Sweet Glaze
",,"I'm going to go ahead and tell you right now that you wouldn't be missing all that much if you didn't see this movie. It tries to pass itself as historical fiction, pertaining to a time period in which magicians were willing to do anything to usurp their fellow illusionists, but at the end it dabbles much too far into the realm of impossibility-explained-with-science that it effectively ruins itself and drops down to the uninteresting ""sci-fi"" category.For about the first two hours, it was what I expected. A dark, mysterious, captivating, and twisted piece of storytelling. I've come to associate each of those elements with director Christopher Nolan and his oddly familiar castChristian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cane, and Scarlett Johansson. But at some point during the course of the above-average directing and acting, the writer messed up. I don't want to give away too much, but it effectively ruins the greatest magic trickthe Transported Manfrom the movie. It became convoluted. It tried so hard to be darker, more mysterious, more captivating, and more twisted, that it eventually turned itself into a pretzel. A crap covered one.The final scenes made an attempt to fix up the original mess by delivering a punch that was actually thought-provoking. Still, you could pass this one up until it comes out on PPV or Blockbuster. Don't pay full price, unless you're a big ""Batman Begins"" fan and need something to satisfy your taste buds until ""The Dark Knight"" is released in 2008."
" What A Dark, Dreary and Dopey Story!
",spoiler,"Is it a sin to want have an enjoyable time when shelling out my hard earned money? Is it too much to ask to have the story make a tiny bit of sense? Am I being unreasonable to want to at identify with, or even like, at least one of a story's characters? In my humble opinion - that's not really asking for too much! When driving home from the theater, it crossed my mind that the two magicians are like Karl Rove, (the Republican party strategist and America's #1 Faustian) - they will do absolutely anything to ""win!"" As far as the story's two main character's are concerned, that means even commit murder (repeatedly in one case), or drive one's wife to suicide! Perhaps the filmmakers were attempting to drive this point home - there are people like our two magician madmen in the real world! While the word ""obsession"" is mentioned about a hundred times in this godforsaken story - it's misleading, like a magician's trick. What this film is really about can be summed up in four words - ""the banality of evil."" How ordinary people can lose track of the simplest of concepts - ""right and wrong. ""The ends don't justify the means. Being famous, powerful, ""and the best"" is not more important than love, family, community, friendship, or even one's soul! What a terribly demoralizing story! The only very small bright spot in this entirely dreary film, was bringing Nikola Tesla, the great inventor and energy theorist into the story. His genius is absolutely fascinating. Too bad most viewers will think he's a fictional character like the rest of the story, instead of an important historical figure! It's a shame the story didn't evolve around him! It would have been a tad bit more entertaining! (Put his name through any reliable search engine, and see for yourself!)"
" so mediocre
",,"Pretty but pointless. Jackman and Caine are very good as always, not too much to say about the others.Like most Chris Nolan movies, seems good but emotionally empty. There should be more payoff for the tension, intensity and rough bits. And Christian Bale is such a tiresome blowhard, especially when he's not pretending to be America. God, what a stiff lipped high strung twit.Perhaps there is more payoff towards the end than I anticipate, I couldn't stand the runaround the movie gives the viewer, so I watched only a portion of this 130min movie. It's a 'movie' for sure, mostly for empty entertainment purposes."
" First time in my life when I wished for a power failure.
",spoiler,"Great movie!!! .. or so I thought. Christopher Nolan is a good director. Not a great one, but a good director. This, and other works of his, prove that.6/10 may be my fault since I raised my expectations quite high for this one. I heard about it, and decided to delight myself with a 'masterpiece'.To be objective, the film could've scored 7-8/10, but only if there were a permanent power failure in the world and I wouldn't have seen the finale.Tesla teleporting hats, cats and people for a living? Come on! That means that Friedrich Nietzsche was selling donuts to buy Jaguar wheels. That was disappointing.I understand that film is 90% fiction, but Nolan, next time stay away from putting real (historical) figures do some fictional facts. Nobody likes it.The other 99% of the movie, is filled with thrill, a great plot, some good situation turns and such.I really couldn't say that I wasted 130 minutes of my life. I wasted only 5 with this movie. Even the credits were more interesting than the finale.Tip: If you're reading this and planning to watch the movie, throw soda on your TV near the end, and don't buy a new one. That way you'll really like this movie! Over and out!"
" Disappointment

But of course , as a die hard film fan, I did and again I was left unsatisfied. Positive : actors : Hugh Jackman / Christian Bale, inside look in some (the ""gruesome"" birdcage)magic tricksNegative :long dreaded, not particularly amusing, not much character deepening, story.Overall : At a certain moment i just wanted the movie to end. And I don't have that often. Probably you have to be a Nolan fan. If you are not don't bother watching this film"
" Every great magic trick consists of three acts
",,"The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. In this particular case, the audience is shown nothing less than Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale displaying their magical acting and accompanied by a magic deck with cards so valuable as Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis and David Bowie. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. The magician goes by the name of Christopher Nolan, and his something extraordinary is the filming of this movie, which captivates from the very beginning: the settings, the pace, the staging, everything is managed in a way the audience will but get hooked. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before. True. But if what you never saw before comes to be some ""Deus ex machina"" sleight of hand, part of the audience shall feel cheated; and all the previous work, though highly remarkable, will end up being part of a trick that lacks ""the prestige""."
" A bit of betrayal at the end
",spoiler,"A very entertaining movie. And as it unfolded I was looking forward to the ""twist"" at the end, I realized that Borden had a twin. A good twist to be sure. Maybe Angier having a twin would have been a cool twist! But it disappointed me at the end. The movie betrayed it's own reality. There is no such thing as ""real"" magic! There is always a trick to it! The machine worked?!!! For the machine to actually transport and duplicate was very cool, but it was a cheap betrayal of the plot's own premise! Don't spend an entire movie grounding me in reality and then insert fantasy. I would have accepted a scam, y'know the hats and cats and all. The machine worked?!!! C'mon! Folks, they pulled the ending out of their ass. It was not a twist. It was ""magic"", and that's lazy movie making that insults the viewer's intelligence!"
" A major disappointment
",spoiler,"""The Prestige"" wasn't really a bad movie, but it did try too hard to be altogether too clever. The problem isn't the cast who are uniformly excellent. The problem is the plot and the script which simply have too many holes, compounded by confusing presentation which jumps back and forth through time and expects the audience to keep up. Not that it's really that hard to keep up, but in the end I got the feeling that it was all just fancy footwork to keep you from realizing just how weak the plot really was.WARNING: Spoiler ahead!Without trying to spoil too much, the ending was especially lame and ultimately unsatisfying. Specifically, it morphed without warning from a well-executed character-driven picture with involving the mechanics and psychology of illusion, into a sci-fi film - and not a very good one at that. Nicola Tesla's descendants should sue everyone involved!A great actor's showcase, but still not recommended..."
" Poor sound quality
",,"Watched this via DVD...and the sound was poor, sometimes low and hard to hear, then normal..near the end the music seemed to be drowning out the conversations... I thought Michael Caine was good. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale do a credible job, but not stellar. David Bowie in a small role is good. The sets are incredible, and the snow scene with the lights is a wow...it would be nice to see such a light show in real-life during the Christmas Holidays. Still the movie is slow at times, and yet, still isn't too bad--not great, but acceptable. This isn't a great movie (far from it, OK, way from from it), and at 130 minutes does seem long. I thought the story was good, the dialogue passable---when it could be heard. I don't know if others have noticed this, but it did distract from the movie. Quality of sound should be standard, but in this one, I felt it really go to be annoying at times, as I had to constantly adjust the volume up, down, up,down.Movie plot wasn't bad and acting was decent..just poor sound production."
" overrated
",spoiler,"A better title for this movie should have been ""Two Jerks as Magicians."" This movie contained two of the most unlikable characters maybe in movie history. Hugh Jackman and Christian play rival magicians who try to outdo each other. Both sacrifice personally for their actions. Scarlett Johansson play the woman caught between th two. She realizes that both of these guys are jerks. So why does the movie tack some kind of mega happy ending where one character lives happily ever after. This film cries out for a darker ending in which both Bale and Jackman get their comeuppance at the end. If you want a story about magic, watch The Illusionist instead. It is superior to this movie in every way shape and form."
" Very Disappointing
",,"Hugely disappointing effort here. I was expecting better from Nolan, after the great ""Batman Begins"", but this was a real letdown. The story is disjointed and confusing in that it keeps jumping back and forth in time so much that you lose the time line, and it all gets muddled. You're not sure what is taking place when. The dialogue is lacking and the direction is not nearly as inspired as I'd hoped. Christian Bale is more effective playing Americans than Brits somehow, and his Cockney accent is not very convincing. Jackman is underwhelming. The major secret of the film is so absurd and deflating that I felt cheated as the credits popped up. If you want to see a ""Turn of the Century Magic Movie"", rent ""The Illusionist"" a much more elegant film, and although it relies more on the supernatural and the suspension of disbelief, it is far less ridiculous and contrived than this dung heap."
" what a trashy movie
",,"This movie sucked big time , i mean that with batman and wolverine a little more action was needed OK. The twist at the end was very much predictable and it went from illusion to science. The illusionist was better but not by much. Don't see it, or rent something else instead.So we better expect better from Nolan with batman 2. And Hugh Jackman with wolverine the movie. I mean Johansen was good but not great, and Caine needed a little more soul and heart like in Batman begins. The cinematography was very good actually, so was the art direction, But the editing and the flashbacks, back and forward, was not very good, and a little confusing sometimes."
" expecting a lot more from Christopher Nolan
",spoiler,"Maybe my expectations for the new Christopher Nolan film were too high, but after I saw it I was extremely disappointed. Of course a good movie doesn't need a plot full of surprising twists, but from the introduction of Fallon early on until the last shot I kept hoping 'please let there be something I am missing'. I was wrong. The first time I saw Fallon, I knew he was a double for 'Borden'. You could easily see it was Bale with a hat, fake nose and hair...Also Sarah's 'today you (don't) love me's made it all too clear. By never showing Fallon's face, or sometimes just plain ignoring him, Nolan made me too curious about him. And it annoyed me. Does Nolan think his post-6th Sense-Fight Club-audience is stupid?And what about that last shot? Was that supposed to shock us? It was immediately obvious when Borden tried to help Angiers from drowning, Angiers was drowning all his 'copies'. Even before that he gave us a lot (too much) of clues (the birds, hats, cats, etc.). It was almost as if he was afraid we wouldn't get it, almost the opposite of Memento.A lot of reviews talk about how good the story was told. Yeah that's right, the story was pre-chewed, pre-microwave-over-cooked and spoon-fed to me. If you wanna see a well made film that doesn't insult it's audience intelligence watch Guy Ritchie's very underrated Revolver..."
" Enjoyable, beautifully made movie, but very predictable
",spoiler,"When I read a few comments on the film and checked the IMDb rating, just before watching the movie, expectancies were high.And I must say, it is a very well made movie. The cast is good, the acting is solid, really no problem there. Same goes for the decors, photography - the movie is a joy to watch, even if the part in the icy woods in Colorado Springs felt very artificial, plastic - like.Only one weak point then as far as I'm concerned: the plot. I felt it was very predictable, from, let's say, the second half of the movie on. The fact that ""real magic"" (a machine that duplicates objects or creatures) was used in the plot, was a major disappointment to me. A beautiful movie then. But not really an intelligent one. Overrated if you ask me. Good entertainment, but nothing more. I gave it a 6/10."
" A good idea ruined!
",spoiler,"""The Prestige, my favorite movie of all time. A perfect movie with probably the best script ever. You got to see it!"" This is what I heard from my brother about The Prestige before I watched it for the first time. I knew absolutely nothing about it, I only had promises of a good movie. So close to be true...Before I start to point out what I disliked about this movie, I shall provide a short summary. Two magicians basically compete about who is the best. That pretty much sums it up, and believe me when I say, the story is great and if you like movies that are 90% good you should consider watching it. However, to me that is not an option. I can't like a movie that was almost perfect. That would be like flying with a pilot that is extremely skilled except he does not know how to land. It simply ruins the entire thing.What I'm talking about is the ending. The story, as stated, is about two magicians competing for the best trick. They go from decent tricks into really advanced trick while the tension between them increases. The atmosphere of the movie becomes really exciting and almost a little frightening. Things happen you don't except and you eagerly wait for a good solution. I did not know there would be a ""twist"" but I expected it after watching most of the movie. When I realized there would be a twist I was so excited I could barely sit still. Boom! There it was... the twist. And what was it? A cloning machine! Pardon my french, but what... the... hell... This movie takes place at about 1899 and the movie is based on making doable, yet amazing tricks. The movie is about them being more clever the the other and cheating each other in the most clever ways. Suddenly, one of them ends up with something like this. A cloning machine! Not even today are you close to being able to clone a human. This makes absolutely no sense.They could have added something like a ""science trick"", like an outstanding, yet realistic achievement in modern science, something with water or electricity. Or make an even more outstanding, yet doable magic trick. But what do they do? They add something as lame as this.This ruined the entire movie. It made me angrier and angrier. How could they destroy such an epic movie with adding such a horrible ending? To summarize this, Chris Nolan should focus on making movies about men dressing as giant winged rats or people going through a million dream layers, he is good at that, but he can't make serious deep movies with great twists.1/10 - Like flying an airplane, a movie who is a nice ride for two hours and then crashes in the end, is not a ride I want to pay for nor participate in."
" Predictable and tedious
",spoiler,"SERIOUS SPOILERS and RANTS!!!! (For The Prestige AND The Illusionist) I just don't understand it--I've read the reviews of this movie here on Amazon and only one other person seems to also feel that the movie was ridiculously predictable early on. The clues were in your face, and then repeated/flaunted/displayed over and over, ad nauseum. Then, to add insult to injury on top of the old hackneyed ""twin theme,"" some pseudoscience is thrown in to boot (clones created ""Highlander"" style--absurd bolts of electricity and all--Star Trek did cloning better in the 60's with Kirk on the whirly machine thing for God's sake). So Jackman's character kills himself/his clones over and over during every show waiting for the one time when Bale's character goes backstage, consequently pinning Jackman's murder on him. At the end they ""divulge"" the big secret that Bale has a twin (DUH?), and then the last scene shows Jackman floating in a tank and we're all supposed to go--wha? I mean wasn't it obvious that Jackman was killing himself over and over? (Or were all those hats and cats just extraneous props to throw us off?) And the Lord is...who?...is it really Hugh Jackman? Geez I didn't see that one coming...only A MILE AWAY. People keep comparing this movie to The Illusionist, but I thought the ending of The Illusionist was equally insulting--I mean, Paul Giamatti had to recount all the steps leading to the ""secret"" of the movie, when it was really obvious early on what had happened. I can only see Ed Norton, who was fantastic in Down in the Valley (as a dubious/not b&w character that kept you thinking) in the edit room arguing, ""What? Why do we have to spoon feed the audience?"" (Wasn't this ""recap"" device used already in Usual Suspects anyway?--only in Usual Suspects it was effective and necessary--at the end of the movie you really do go ""ah ha! I didn't see that coming! Simply brilliant."") Christian Bale was incredible in The Machinist and American Psycho (even Batman was interesting). He has the charisma of a rock in The Prestige. Michael Caine is...basically Michael Caine. Hugh Jackman--he IS Wolverine. In this movie he falls flat. I don't feel his anger. I should want Bale's character incinerated for what he did, though maybe inadvertently, to Jackman's wife. But I don't feel anything. I've been a fan of Scarlett since Ghost World. No extraordinary acting here though. David Bowie, however, (whether he looks like the real Tesla or not) was very engaging. I wanted to see more of him. Oh well. I give it two stars just because I love the actors, though not in this particular movie."
" Below par movie from ""Memento"" creator
",spoiler,"I came to see this movie with very high hopes, but came away severely disappointed. In an age where it seems every movie has to have a 'surprise ending' this is no different from many other movies out there at the moment. I guess the bulk of my criticism comes from the fact that I guessed the plot of the film, together with its two theorethically surprise twists at the end about 20 minutes (Tesla exhibition + multiple top-hats in the first scenes of the movie) and 40-45 minutes into the movies (Borden gravediggin'). From then on it was just waiting and saying to myself 'That was so obvious'. At fault is the director and scriptwriter who seemed to throw to much apparent clues too soon in the movie.Chris Bale does I must say a spectacular job as Borden, with Hugh Jackman supplying a satisfying if indifferent performance. The biggest flop was the babe meaning Scarlett Johannson, who seems to think the only thing necessary to act is to show some skin and to pucker up her seductive lips.I especially find flaw with the whole premise of the story... if you do a magic film you take one of three routes to make it coherent and with some cohesive background.A) You include real magic making the story more mystical; B) You put into the movie unexplainable events and leave it to the audience to decide if the magic is real or false; C) You show that everything is a trick, although the tricks are so ingenious that they add a certain punch to the movie.YOU DON'T DO SOMETHING WHICH IS A BIT OF THIS OR A BIT OF THAT making it in a muddled incoherent mess. Unfortunately all solutions to the movie were basically the easiest solutions, meaning that the scriptwriters (novelist?) really didn't try to hard to think of more surprising alternatives to the story.The end solutions were apparent from a mile away, the Scarlett role was dismal and all in all the story very much unimpressive. Giving these factors even though I absolutely love ""Memento"" and congratulate Nolan on ""Batman Begins"" I have to give my thumbs down and a 3/10 (with one point added for Christian Bale's portrayal)."
" What a surprise ending!! I was SO CERTAIN that it wouldn't be stupid!
",,"I don't care about the people in this movie, nor about any romance or struggles they were involved in.And if I say to hell with the characters--the message is the point; that's even worse. The message is neither inspiring, nor enough of an opposite of inspiring to give the stimulating, titillating gift of darkness.I really went in wanting to like it, and wanting to care about what was going on (and I really like almost all of these actors). And I'm normally not too good at guessing endings and so on... Wow. Not one single surprise that you weren't at least suspecting far in advance. Sometimes, it just boggled the mind; when something was introduced as a surprise, I was sitting there thinking, ""Um, didn't they explicitly reveal this an hour ago?"" Maybe I'm just missing the point that it's really for twelve-year-old girls or something.Yes, that must be it.I really feel robbed. Sometimes after a movie, there's that afterglow that just fills you up. Sometimes, it's so sad and moving that you can think about it five days later and still work up a tear. Sometimes, it's that it's so fun to think about it, over and over the details... In this case, what I'm left with is wanting to kick someone. It's the feeling of sorta wanting to kick myself, but the 8.5-star rating that's currently the average on IMDb excuses my mistake.The movie makes you feel like a sucker, and gives you almost nothing in return.It was mildly pretty, but... I'm still waiting for the prestige, here."
" Highly overrated...
",,"As a fan of Christopher Nolan's work on Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, I thought I would enjoy The Prestige as well. I was wrong. The good news is I just caught the film on Encore, so the only thing I wasted was my time.I do not fault Mr. Nolan or any of the actors (save a lacking performance by Scarlett Johansson). The real problem here is the story. Without going into detail let me just say that the movie started with an interesting premise and devolved into a ""I'm better than you"" farce between the two main characters. I sat there in disbelief as Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman (both of whom I admire) were forced to lower themselves into a story like this. One of them wrongs the other somehow, and the other then returns the favor. This is Bale's most unfortunate film role choice since Reign of Fire.Now don't get me wrong...as I said I do not fault the actors. Bale and Jackman performed as well as they could under the circumstances. However, since the story itself lost my interest, even the greatest actors in the world could not save it."
" A confusing mess
",spoiler,"A great disappointment. Save your money and skip this movie. Two rival magicians appear to be one trick ponies. An audience will easily guess the secret behind their apparent magic. The romantic entanglements are entirely unconvincing. Interweaving of characters, the movie viewer never knowing for sure who is who, leaves the film-goer in a muddle. In the end, it is not worth working out the details. A waste of my time, and yours if you see it.Actors are all fine. A bitter rivalry between Nikola Tesla and Edison over direct current or alternating current as the best means of transmitting electricity has just a bit of a mention without all the drama it took in real life. Tesla surprisingly well portrayed by David Bowie. Edison does not appear but sends thugs to burn down Tesla's laboratory. (Highly unlikely.) Too bad the writers did not see fit (or did NOT know) to show the first use of AC in the electric chair to execute condemned criminals was touted by the Edison camp as showing how dangerous AC current was. I would certainly have written this into the script as it would fit nicely with the plot as it developed.I liked ""The Illusionist"" better as a film about magicians performing on stage, a better portrayal of the Victorian era, and a much better love story. This film never revealed the secret of the magician's tricks, a far better decision thins in ""The Prestige""."
" life-ruining bad
",,"I hated this movie. I saw it in the theater and after it was over I just felt horrible. I was hungry but I didn't want to eat anything, I was tired but didn't want to sleep, I didn't want to talk to any of my friends, even my cigarette tasted bad. I ended up going home and washing dishes. Three or four hours later I snapped out of it but it was real downer.It's not even like the movie was depressing, I like depressing movies, I like dark movies and sad movies and horror movies. But this was something different, it was life-ruining bad. And it wasn't even that any one aspect of the film was flawed specifically, (although I particularly hated the editing) just the entire movie turned me off. I don't know what I am supposed to leave this movie with, a lot of people keep saying that the entire film is a magic trick, which would make the film's director the magician. so in the end when he outsmarts me with his twist ending, I guess I am supposed to be amazed and astounded at how clever he is, and how not clever I am. I don't know why anybody would want to see a film where the director is just flaunting his intellectual superiority over his audience.The movie is like some awful prank, like director Chris Nolan took my car keys and through them in a river."
" A sorry excuse for a movie
",,"There is nothing profound or interesting about this movie. It is choppy and confusing, and seems like it drags on forever. It has long series of plot holes instead of a plot. The two main characters are neither interesting nor likable. The main premise (which leads to the great ""denouement"" at the end) is not only obvious, it's ridiculous. The movie says nothing about ambition or the quest for perfection or any of the other deep stuff people pretend to see in it. It's about a couple of guys so consumed by mutual hatred and envy that they can't seem to get a life of their own. This movie makes The Illusionist seem plausible and coherent by comparison. A waste of talent, especially Michael Caine's."
" Two magician pals become rivals after one of their performances turns tragic
",spoiler,"Some movies, while lingering in your thoughts after leaving the theater, mellow like a fine wine. This turned to vinegar very quickly. The story began sensibly enough, but then quickly degenerates into an incoherent mess, as if the script was half-written when given the studio's green light, financed, and cast, then sloppily given a dopey, intelligence-insulting last written half. Having seen ""The Illusionist"", I almost thought they had attempted a poor satire of the much, much better movie. As if taking a cue from this nit-witty script, the acting, from such a star-studded cast, was amazingly half-rate. Scarlet Johanssen should not attempt a British accent ever, ever again; even Michael Caine's and Christian Bale's cockney accents were cringe-inducing and they're both British! Even with the large budget they were probably given for set design (it takes place around 1899), they still screwed this up and made it look incredibly amateurish - the scenes of Colorado Springs from a hillside made the town look like a wintertime snow-globe village. The special effects were wasted on the idiotic idea that Nicola Tesla built an energy globe that could replicate objects and, oh my God, people. All in all, a forgettable movie."
" If You want pain in your back & neck then this is the movie for you
",spoiler,"thats right i enjoy Hugh Jackman & Christian bale movies but this just caused me pain its been a month & i am still recovering from this boring explosion,my whole body is in pain.all the actors looks bored & Christopher Nolan what is wrong with this guy his batman films are good but when he picks up a camera he loves to film in the night or even in the daylights cant shoot a scene with proper light.& please the length of the film is 2 hours please stop trolling the audiencenow lets get to the plot OK all the critics & people who praise this movie i hate them no seriously i get the plot tow guys want to be the best in the business of magic & be ultimate bale & Hugh Jackman were on coke that day when they signed this film.all that twists in the movie until the end i knew one of them was gonna lose it would have been nice if they both were cool & walked away.& that big machine & crazy science stuff is a joke what these guy are drinking i want that.i am saying is please don't hate me for my review a lot of people are gonna thumb me down specially Nolan fans guys i like Nolan but i don't droll over him.so please forgive me if i don't like this OK.my rating is 2/10 for some nice magic show but stay away from this movie i say because the prestige is for sleepy people only"
" The Kayzer Soze syndrome (SPOILER ALERT)
",,"All I want to tell you about The Prestige is that it definitely suffers from the Kayzer Soze syndrome. For those who do not know who Kayzer Soze is -- go watch The Usual Suspects. Since the release of that film there have been quite a lot of Hollywood releases that have tried to copy the formula from Usual Suspects. The problem is, however, 1) the formula is sucked dry by now, and 2) in order to amuse the audience, they need to feel respected and not be messed with. It's not the amount of plot twists that matters, it's the quality. The Usual Suspects had a single plot twist and it was a brilliant one. The Prestige has a whole bunch of twists, none of which are credible or intelligent. And, one must not forget (SPOILER ALERT), the only one dumb enough to use the twin brother concept as a cover-up for plot holes, is Jean-Claude van Damme. Oh, and I must admit, apart from the plot, the acting, cinematography and directing itself is pretty good. Especially Jackman has shown to be more than a mere Muscles from Brussels or whatever town he's from."
" This is an excellent film, despite some flaws that can't be ignored.
",spoiler,"As a guest at the world premier of this film, held at the El Capitan in Hollywood on October 17, 2006, I can say that not only did I enjoy it very much, but that the enthusiasm with which the audience received it seemed genuine and unaffected by the presence of those principals who attended.Among the many virtues of this film are the exquisite cinematography, the solid writing and story line, the respect with which magic is treated, and the fabulous acting. Michael Caine, to those paying attention, really steals the show with his characteristic understated mien.The presentation of magic is very well done; and the art of magic is obviously revered. As this reviewer understands it, the film was largely shot on a closed set, and only those who needed to be privy to how the actual magic effects were accomplished had access when those scenes were shot.The characters, for the most part, were three dimensional and their motives adequately justified their actions. If one could wish for more in this regard, it would be to have some more back-story on the leading characters.Which, as it happens, runs counter to my main criticism of this film: It is too long. It is too long by 15 or 20 minutes. Still, whence to cut those 15 or 20 minutes is very difficult to say. There is no one scene that, in retrospect, seems expendable. The paring might best be done one frame at a time; but however it is done, the film needs to be shorter.My only other criticisms of the film (and herein resides my spoiler) are that there is no explanation of how the Tesla device reproduces the object in its field, and neither is there an explanation of how the point at which the reproduction appears can be set. A minor criticism, because it could have been handled in one or two lines of dialog, is that Angier's (Hugh Jackman) dual consciousness is not explained. In fact, Cutter (Michael Caine) recounts a drowning story in such a way as to indicate that the transported Angier wouldn't know the agony of drowning. Yet the film briefly shows two Angiers simultaneously conscious, implying that both of them could have continued Angier's life with full access to his life's continuum.The film, although it tests the audience's ability to suspend disbelief, is rich enough overall to warrant a hearty recommendation. It will be an Oscar contender."
" I was wondering when it would end!
",,"The prestige was god awful. The characters mumbled their lines, almost the entire movie was presented in flashback form and it makes you wanna fall asleep.As the movie started I could vaguely tell what was going on, or whether it was flashback or present, the characters mumbled their lines as if they were scared to perform As the movies plot thickens so many times and it adds so many dramatic twists that you begin to lose count and lose interest in what's going on and stop caring. The movie dredged on and on and on, I was falling asleep. As I was falling asleep I was wondering ""Why am I sitting here, I can get out and get my money back"" and so I did, but I think I should sue for lost time and embarrassment. Short summary, this movie sucked. Interesting Idea, horrible execution. I would have given it a two, but it was so long I couldn't stand it anymore, so 1."
" Mostly disappointing......
",spoiler,"This had a lot of potential and the same tricks as batman begins. The dreary landscapes and overt use of dull colors to make to movie more sombre than it actually is. If I didn't know better I would guess that Nolan had a gay affair with Christian bale. Bale needs to overcome his lisp( speech impediment) and his 1 dimensional acting. The plot is predictable and sometimes you are tricked to think that there could be more than the obvious, but that feeling is ephemeral. British accents are laughable and the premise of Tesla inventing duplicating machines is an challenging ones intelligence. The Nolans need to ease up on the toke and think of something less inane. I'm afraid that the people who were awed by this insipid movie need to increase their cognitive capabilities."
" Do We Like These People?
",spoiler,"The answer to that question is ""no."" Although I found the story quite fascinating and overall, the film well done--another great performance by Michael Caine--in order for it to really work, the audience has to be rooting for someone. As the movie progresses, we find each of the 2 magicians and the women less and less likeable. A look at illusions and magic ""backstage"" was educational, and I certainly was not bored. However, the conclusion that one magician used cloning was a disappointment as it is impossible, at least in the way it was done in the film. But the worst pill to swallow: although I haven't read ALL the reviews here, I haven't found anyone who addressed the callousness of a twin sacrificing his brother's life as one of them did in the story. And do we REALLY know which one survived?"
" Great Big Hole
",spoiler,"There is a great big hole in the plot. Angier is obsessed with knowing what knot Borden used to tie his wife up just prior to her death. And Borden was haunted because he couldn't remember.The problem is her hands were STILL tied together when she was rescued from the tank. All Angier had to do was look! Either of them would have looked. Wouldn't you check that first if you suspected it was the wrong knot that caused her death?! Even if both of them were too distraught at the time (really??) you'd think Cutter would have taken note. Here, let me rewind the movie just a bit for you, guys....."
" Loses impact on a second viewing
",,"The first time I saw The Prestige I was absolutely blown away by it. I was staring at the screen, slack jawed, halfway through the credits. The twist ending in this is phenomenal and mind-bending... the first time. Once you know the twist, however, it seems like the film has no point. Watch it once, have your mind blown and then just let that be the film experience you associate with this film, because the second time is just disappointing."
" Bad
",,"I did not enjoy this movie nearly as much as I was expecting based on the hype. I gave it such a bad rating to balance the good ones.It moved incredibly slowly, was overly predictable and repetitive, was *barely* redeemable by an exciting yet still BAD ending. It portrays magician performers as kind of lame and immature, not realistic and not relatable. There are some *really bad* actors that play minor roles in this movie. Overall the movie was cheesy and the dialogue is just plain bad. If there was no twist, this movie would have absolutely nothing entertaining about it. Not recommended."
" Unsatisfying, overrated
",,"A film about magicians, and of course magicians make a business tricking people. Usually, though, the audience doesn't figure out the trick, and that's why it works. Unfortunately here the trick is laid bare and it makes the whole thoroughly disappointing. There is much more promised than delivered, and I find it hard to recommend to anyone. Part of the disappointment is that it could have been so much more. The premise is interesting, the characters start out interesting... as is, though, it needs a major rewrite. Sorry."
" ""My liege, I did deny no prisoners...""
",spoiler,"I generally like Nolan's movies, but there isn't much good to say about The Prestige. It could be worse, of course, but...The plot is hardly interesting enough to go into details. Suffice it to say that ""do the ends justify the means?"" is really a no-brainer here because the means are tremendously out of proportion. The conflict between the two magicians has trivial origins and is finally resolved by a trivial gunshot and a trivial hanging. So what was that laws-of-physics-bending-McGuffin for? (I mean the cloning machine.) Not to mention ciphers and lies, intrigues and counter-intrigues, kidnappings and (self-)mutilations. They could simply have a duel - next morning at sunrise would do just fine.Most characters have no past at all and the movie gives no clue as to how and why have they become what they are. I'm really trying to find epithets to describe them other than ""dull"" and ""one-dimensional"" but nothing comes to mind. And Tesla... well, this is just plain embarrassing. He's perhaps the most likable character and I like how David Bowie portrayed him but unfortunately he's not the inventor and scientist Tesla, he's the urban myth wizard Tesla. *sigh* I bet if this movie were set in the XVII century and featured Sir Isaac Newton, we'd see the proverbial apple...And when a drunk actor hired by Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) suddenly cites a line from ""Henry V"" there's a distinct feeling that, indeed, with $40m budget Christopher Nolan could pick a better story. Yeah, one of Shakespeare's plays for example.5/10: Like I said, it could be worse. The problem is that it could most certainly be better."
" Well acted and shot but the plot sucks
",spoiler,"It's not very often I feel the urge to write a (small) review of a movie I've seen on IMDb. This one however, ranked #73 on the IMDb by the time I watched it, makes me feel I have to state my opinion.With a great cast and a wonderful director this movie seems to have everything to make it awesome. At first it does not disappoint. With it's non chronological narrative it sets out to be an intelligent story that like it's subject (magic) will provide many surprises.The eventual plot however could easily suck a golf ball through a garden hose. Imagine Shawshank Redemption or American Beauty ending with a UFO landing explaining all the unanswered questions. We can praise the element of surprise but it still would not fit the story. I feel the same way about The Prestige. Too bad they could not come up with an ending or plot that would have suited the high quality of the rest of the movie!"
" Tesla would have laughed - an overrated movie
",spoiler,"I approve of the way ""The Prestige"" engages viewers and makes them concentrate (there are too few such films lately), but it is too belabored for me. Cheats abound; for one, Fallon is never properly introduced as a character, and none of the characters displays any knowledge of the other except what is in the moment. Tesla himself would have laughed as he was aware of the law of conservation of matter and energy. The outcome is just wrong - both magicians should have ended up as the figurative ""Man in the Box"". It has some excellent moments and I like that it engaged the audience, but with its needlessly time-warped narrative, lack of characterization, and empty flash, it's something of a con."
" Seems like some of the film is missing..because not everything adds up...
",,"In a magic trick it usually consists of a hook, line, and sinker. The magician presents the scenario, proves its impossibility, and then defies the odds. How the trick is pulled off, magicians usually don't reveal. In movie-making however, it doesn't quite work in the same fashion. If you present a film that raises questions and the end of the final act does not answer them, then you have yourself a panned and wildly criticized film. The only kinds of questions that can remain unanswered are that which bare little importance to the main plot itself. Tarantino mastered this, by giving unanswered questions to almost all his films (Best example: Briefcase in Pulp Fiction). The Prestige however, suffers awfully from being unable to answer important questions. While the movie itself is entertaining, albeit a bit long, it fails to wrap up the story the way really good films do, like its rival 2006 magician hit The Illusionist. The hook and line are bearable to watch, but the sinker fails to satisfy. While it did give its nice twists and turns, The Prestige does not leave a satisfying finish.Rivalries can be very ugly. Take the Yankees-Red Sox, Bears-Packers, Canada-United States, Tupac-B.I.G., and Coke-Pepsi as pure examples. Some can be friendly, some can result in tension, and others result in worse. In the case of The Prestige, we have two magicians ready to kill each other if the opportunity was given. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rival magicians that are so hell-bent on figuring out the other's latest tricks and amazing acts that they will put their families, even their lives on the line. Meanwhile, Cutter (Michael Caine) is in the middle of it all, trying to end the foolish rivalry before it escalates into something more. Throughout the film you see each person gain the upper hand in terms of skills, success, and happiness more than once, but like a seesaw it goes back and forth until the final moments.Handling this grim and dark tale of competition is an all-star cast, an accomplished director, and David Bowie? Anyways, Christopher Nolan, who has been acclaimed as one of the better current directors out there, directs this film with a technique that mixes the choppy Memento and the dark Batman Begins. Using darker colors, longer shots to portray emotion, and hints and clues throughout, Nolan is certainly the right man to tackle this story because of its non-linear course. He does a much better job here than in Batman Begins in terms of serving a gloomy atmosphere and dim tone. Also involved in the writing, the Nolan brothers did a good job hiding the secrets from the audience, but also stretched the plot a bit too long, when it could have easily been a much shorter film. Perhaps it was because they wanted to foreshadow the ending on multiple instances? Perhaps because providing more content would give the ending a bit more closure? Nonetheless, not everything seen in the first two acts was actually necessary.At least we have some fine acting to help move the story along. Hugh Jackman removes the claws and does a superb job as a broken, bitter magician whose better days left him after circumstances beyond his control. Michael Caine tops Jackman with his portrayal as the magician not taking sides in the entire case, even when loves are on the line. David Bowie and Scarlett Johansson were good, but a bit underused. Christian Bale on the other hand, didn't provide as much effort here as in previous performances like in Batman Begins, The Machinist, among others.Pacing of the movie is its ultimate strength and its ultimate weakness. In a non-linear film, moving too fast would be confusing and make the viewer more lost than a blind drunk man in a mirror maze. Once again, citing Pulp Fiction as an example, the modern masterpiece clocks in at over 140 minutes, is slow-paced, and yet remains astoundingly entertaining and fun because it is so rich in content and detail. The Prestige on the other hand doesn't quite dazzle and entertain the way Pulp Fiction, Memento, Fight Club, and other non-linear movies do. With a phenomenal amount of dialogue and little action, the true fun of the film comes within its mysteries, its questions raised.Yet exactly like what would happen if the television show Lost abruptly ended, The Prestige does not answer all the questions, even when the credits roll. As the film progresses and the plot becomes thicker and the tensions and stakes raises, a lot of details raise questions about the who, the where, the why, and especially the how. Nolan was good at teasing the audience and leaving the bait, but failed to go for the kill when he really should've. He did not wrap up the story in a nice bow, or in a fashion that would leave the average viewer fulfilled. The Illusionist followed a similar pattern of leaving clues to the grand finale, except the ending answered all that needed to be answer. With questions that could result in several different answers, each of them potentially changing major themes in the movie itself, answers were more than necessary here and it was not delivered.Bottom Line: The Prestige is a dark, twisting movie that doesn't seem to find its course, and while it keeps the audience in check, it leads to an abrupt dead end with many questions hanging around. The direction was great, the casting was wonderful, and the cinematography was outstanding, but something in the writing was lacking--seemed to be missing. Then, to make things a bit more disappointing comes the final act, which may leave some viewers pleased, but may leave others scratching their heads. If you want all answers revealed, you are in for a major disillusionment."
" Don't Expect Too Much or it may be Disappointing
",spoiler,"This is one of those movies where the story is the main attraction. It is a very sad and disturbing movie about intense and violent rivalry, this time in the field of magic, at the turn of the century.The set and art direction, as well as the costumes are also very good. Interesting thing also to inject a real character, Nikola Tesla (played by David Bowie!), in there. Did not know that Tesla had a bad conflict with Thomas Edison and it was that severe! (Should read up on that....)I felt that the acting styles of the two leads were one of the disappointing points of the movie. Hugh Jackman tends to be too over the top, as if he were in a stage production. Christian Bale is severely underplaying his part, his face seemed to be in a perpetual scowl. Of course, the fact that they were playing two dislikable characters probably contributed to this.The direction of the movie by Christopher Nolan is typical of him. Jumping back and forth in time, it was OK but I felt it made the movie a bit hard to follow at the beginning. But once you get the drift, it was very interesting.****Spolier Alert****Maybe it was just me, but one major thing that confused me was Julia, the wife of Angier (Hugh Jackman). She looked like Scarlett Johanssen. Then later after the wife dies in a tragic stage accident, Angier's assistant, Olivia, was again Scarlett Johanssen. Admittedly, I had to stop the DVD right at that point and run to the computer to check IMDb because it was affecting my appreciation of the movie. Turns out that the wife Julia was played by a different actress, Piper Perabo. Olivia is really Scarlett. OK then, these two girls were just fixed up in too much the same way. Once that was settled, I was able to follow the flow of the story much better.The ending is another problem for me. After all the revenge and the deaths, I felt the happy ending for one of them was completely undeserved."
" Clever, but not highly compelling or memorable
",,"A very clever film (not surprising for a film about a couple of magicians) that is so concerned with being clever, that it becomes a little confusing. I was left thinking I needed to watch it again, not because of the pleasure I had watching it, but because I wasn't sure I ""got it,"" completely. The problem was that I had absolutely no sympathy for the two magicians who were so self absorbed, and mean spirited in their relentless ambition to out-do each other, that I couldn't bring myself to watch it again. Also, I think it was a little too long for what it was, to the point of getting a little tedious. All this is not to say that there aren't some positives. Firstly, the cinematography in this film is outstanding. I saw this on DVD, but I can imagine it would be great on the big screen. The wardrobe and set design where excellent, which really helped bring an aura of authenticity to this period piece. The acting was pretty darn good as well, which is no surprise, considering the veteran talent in the cast. I enjoyed seeing David Bowie as Nicolai Tesla; he so transformed into this character that I didn't realize at first who the actor was. Also, it added an element of interest to call attention to Tesla the man, whose visionary theories are considered revolutionary, even in modern times. Although duplicating people...this may be a little much even for Tesla. But I'm no expert on Tesla. The Presence of Scarlett Johansson in the cast was also one of the reasons I wanted to see this film. Her role here, though, was a little on the insubstantial side. Not surprisingly, she is cast typically (it seems, lately) as the smokin' hot eye candy of the film. She certainly is capable of playing character roles of much more depth, as I have seen in films such as ""Lost in Translation"" and ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" for example. Nonetheless, I think she did do a good job here, for what it was. So all in all, I would have to say that for me this was a mildly interesting and entertaining film, though certainly not highly compelling or memorable."
" a huge let-down
",,"Coming from the director of 2 gripping movies in Memento and Batman begins,""The Prestige"" is a complete let-down.The story line is very thin and plot revealed at the end makes it look like a joke.It might precisely been his intention-to explain ow ludicrously simple magic tricks are-but then I wouldn't want to spending 2.5 hours of completely non-sensical attempts of sabotage(some of them had me in guffaws at the ridiculous stupidity of it all)only to find I was being taken for a ride all along. I can't help feeling he has tried to make a simple narrative needlessly complex trying to give psychological connotations to the entire story, and ""going back and forth in time"" stuff-which was completely unnecessary. Clearly he's suffering from ""Memento"" hangovers. At least,a genuine attempt at character development would have ensured that the magicians mind connected with the audience but sadly that was not to be.At times, I wondered if I was watching a comedy movie gone wrong or genuinely made to go wrong.Performances too are ordinary.Only thing that saves the movie are the few moments of good direction,good visuals and not to forget,the magic tricks that are demystified!"
" Darn...I really wanted to like this movie.
",spoiler,"I have not read the book and so I suppose I should so I can give the story a fair shake. But the whole ""Tesla and His Miraculous Achievements"" aspect of the story, which is absolutely crucial to the plot, just turned me off like one of Tesla's bulbs.With all due respect to a great man, Tesla was largely a showman...just like Edison and many other inventors and scientists of his day. Self promotion was the rule and, given the opportunity, they would gladly explain (or imply) that they could power vehicles at great distances, create earthquakes, and perform similar miracles. The idea that Tesla either discovered some natural force or designed an elaborate machine (remember, while there were some primitive vacuum tubes in development prior to 1900, it was only after the turn of the century that they became practical for use in electronic circuits) to accomplish ""The Prestige"" is so bizarre that it basically doesn't even rise to the level of deus ex machina.So, as we say here in NC, the movie was ""fairly well ruin't"" for me at that point.I was also disappointed in the basic absence of any period magic or sleight of hand. There were a few examples here and there, just the minimum to try to establish credibility, but it was pretty tame and not at all of any interest.As far as the production and acting, that's the only reason it got as high a score from me as it did. Jackman was a so-so, Bale did OK (unfortunately, you really need to watch through to the end to appreciate his acting), and Bowie was a surprising, but good, choice as Tesla.Definitely not a DVD to purchase and I'm not sure that I would even rent it if I had known a bit more about it."
" The Prestige
",,"The Prestige Prestige is about rivalry between two young magicians, who turn from friend to foe due to a mistake in which the lover of one magician is killed. This results in both the magician trying to out-play each other in each and every magic trick they perform, leading in the end to one magician being killed by the other. The story is about the twist and turns, flash-backs and magic-tricks. The plot is set up in early 20th century London. The direction is good. By the time the movie is little bit more than half  way over, you will realize the possibility of the mystery that the director is trying to evade your eyes. Than the remaining movie you will watch just to see whether the director brings a new turn to the story, and does it not match your sense of analysis. To mine it matched  but the movie is a bit beyond our knowing director's mystery. There are many twists and turns to confuse the viewers, may be the director expected the viewer to have a second go at the movie to properly understand and put the zig-saw puzzle in order. Would I venture for another viewing to better understand what happened in the movie? No, I would not.Both the lead actors  Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale  play their role with conviction. Michael Caine as an adviser to Hugh Jackman also fits well in that character's role. There are two heroines  Piper Perabo - playing wife of Christian, and Scarlett Johansson  playing assistant and mistress for both magician from time to time.Is there a thrill in the movie? A Bit. Is there a mystery in the movie? A forced mystery  the director after taking so many twists and turn in the script could had the freedom to end the movie any which way he was happy with. Every or any ending in this movie would be a mystery.(5 Stars out of 10)"
" The Prestige- Don't Need this Type of Honor 1/2*
",,"Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman have a field day torturing each other and ultimately all who see this nonsense.As two magicians, one's mistake led to the tragic death of Jackman's wife and the two spend the rest of the picture trying to outsmart the other.Interesting to see Daniel Davis show up in this film as a British judge. He received well deserved praise as Niles, the butler, in the television show ""The Nanny."" Apparently, the American Davis had such a good strong British accent on the show, he was thought of when this film was made.The film is hopelessly confusing as we go on. It is never properly explained who these Edison people were and what they were actually trying to do.The end is a joke and a mystifying one at that.Veteran pro Michael Caine is in this for the ride I guess. Don't run to see magic shows when you see this eerie film. Strange things are happening."
" Waste of Time and Energy
",spoiler,"!!CONTAINS SPOLERS!!! One of the worst films I have seen in a while. Multiple mean-spirited characters doing nasty things to one another for over two hours does not constitute a good story. The only message I could possibly see here was that mean poor people should triumph over mean rich people. There was not one character that I felt any sympathy or empathy for by the end of the film. They all double crossed each other and sold each other out repeatedly. On top of that, the film makers double crossed the audience, by strategically leaving things out only to reveal the true facts of various interactions later on just to fool the viewer. How could anyone walk away from this feeling even okay, much less good, about the film? The high rating it is getting is an absolute amazement to me. The trend in films now seems to be if you can have enough screwy twists to keep the audience thinking about the twists, character development, moral lessons, decent plots and story lines don't need to exist. This really took off with ""The Sixth Sense"" (which was actually a pretty decent movie)and continues to be the trend. There have been a few good films with interesting plot twists but the popularity of misdirection just for its own sake has gotten completely out of hand.I wish the movie going public would stop rewarding these kind of lame efforts and pay more attention to the important elements of story telling. Like having at least one or more characters that you can empathize with at least a little bit. Or things like a story that doesn't have to have some bizarre deus ex machina to make it work.I may be living in a fantasy world, but one can at least hope.UPDATE 05-29-2008 - I like the actors in this film so much I gave it a second chance. Going in with lowered expectations after my first viewing helped, and I actually found myself enjoying the journey of the characters. The story itself is actually not bad just ambigous. I have to admit, even though I don't exaclty love this movie, it was not as bad as I initlially thought. Still not one I would highly recommend, but alright for late night cable TV fare."
" Very bad and boring...
",,"This movie was bad, really bad. It is longer than it should have been. It has no twists and no interesting story.At first I thought it would have been a cool movie where I enjoy the battle of wits between two magician. But this movie has none of that. It is just so predictable.The other problem I had with this movie is that it has no lovable character. Everyone is just an asshole and I don't feel like supporting any of these guys.And when you sit down and think about it, what the hell is the point of wasting your life for a stupid magic show. These character motivations make no sense, in fact the characters themselves make no sense at all. They are like robots.Bottomline, the movie is bad."
" Make my money reappear please!
",spoiler,"When compared to the vastly better THE ILLUSIONIST, this film pales. I found myself actually being bored and kept waiting for something, anything to capture my imagination....to wow me. As an audience, the narrator within the film urges us to pay attention, and I did, for the duration - wondering why I didn't go to see another movie. The only real acting in the film was done by the character of Bale's wife in the film. Her scenes were touching...the rest...well lets just the ticket seller was the only one in the theater working slight of hand. Count me completely unimpressed.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were just OK, Michael Caine passable, and Scarlett forgettable. The only thing I can say about this movie is that its about obsession and the damage it can cause. Sorry, nothing magical about that!"
" Modernist blackness doesn't cut it.
",,"So. This movie has a cumulative rating of 8.5. It is about magicians/illusionists. One of the great things about watching magicians/illusionists is trying to figure out how they do their tricks/illusions. The movie and reviewers say watch carefully, and, watch the movie again, to see what the tricks/illusions are and try to figure out how they are done. There is just one big fat problem with all that. You can't see anything. The director, cinematographer, and lighting guy are of the silly conceit that period movies should be heard but not seen. The lighting guy analogized to Hitchcock, but there is just one problem with that. With Hitchcock, you might not be able to understand exactly what was going on, you might not be able to figure out what was going on, but you could always see what was going on. I don't understand. The budget for this thing was $40 mill. and they decided to keep people from seeing what they spent their money on. It might have been a decent movie, but it is so dark, you can't see anything, so, what was the point in making the movie. There certainly isn't much point in trying to watch it. Let's face it, a dark black screen isn't that exciting and doesn't hold viewer interest. The big Prestige at the end? You can't see what leads up to it so it doesn't shock, surprise, or matter. 8.5? Can't see it. 1."
" No, I don't understand the plot, and I don't care
",,"Probably a well crafted plot, but awfully confusing visually because of the ""twins"" that appear intermittently.The cinematography is top notch, and actors are decent, so it's a quality piece no doubt, but I didn't like the story (at all). There were more sadistic meanness in each of the characters that escalated from around the middle of the movie, and then continued to no end until its (trashy) ending. I don't care if one was smarter than the other or outwitted the other. The ugliness of the confrontation got appalling to a point where intrigue didn't matter anymore. I also didn't like the audio, how sudden blast of sound got injected to make you jump up from your seats. I know it's digital, and I know that theaters have mega watt systems, but is it really necessary to crank up the volume so loud suddenly ?Nice to watch visually, but the characters and the story that goes with it were unpalatable."
" The Prestige wasn't worth the Pricetag
",spoiler,"This movie was a disappointment. Both Jackman and Bales looked uncomfortable portraying magicians. Nolan did a nice job of limiting their acts of prestidigitation, but frankly, it wasn't enough. There was no flamboyance; nothing to make the characters stand out as leading illusionists.Major flaws: There was no explanation as to how the great Danton became so wealthy, wealthy enough to buy his transference machine from Tesla, another boring and disappointing performance.It was obvious from the start that Bales had a twin brother in disguise, and one could easily guess that they switched off doing roles on stage and performing in the boudoir. The unveiling of this secret was... nothing.The whole idea of a machine that created a carbon copy of Danton every performance was just plain dumb. Nikola Tesla was not a mystical character, historically, and to portray him as someone who could transcend the laws of physics was insulting to those of us with more than animal intelligence.I have not yet seen The Illusionist, but I'm sure the performances by Norton and Giamatti will be much better. It can hardly be possible that they could be worse.Mike"
" How many times can you double-cross your audience?
",,"In 1890s London, two magicians--once protégés of the same aging illusionist--consistently undercut each other on and off the stage, reveling in the revenge and one-upsmanship; Hugh Jackman is the one with the show business flair, while rough-hewn toughie Christian Bale is more intent on conquering the intricacies of unexplainable magic. Using rather obvious ploys (like phony beards and wigs, not to mention Scarlett Johansson as an assistant/secret agent), they each work as much on sabotaging the other's latest success as developing their own skills. This fantastic tale might have bowled us over with a few cunning twists; unfortunately, the baffling screenplay reminds one more of H.G. Wells than ""Sleuth"", coming up with a bag of tricks so far-fetched it removes the film's core of inherent reality. It is remarkably well-dressed and crafted, although the jumpy editing at the start, darting around in time before settling into a more conventional mode of storytelling, is rather a nuisance. The acting is solid throughout, even as the plot-gimmicks become more and more ridiculous, leading to a depressing and flat conclusion. **1/2 from ****"
" A beautiful period piece, nearly ruined by sloppy plotting
",spoiler,"If I were to judge this movie just on the quality of the acting and the beauty of the photography, costumes, set design, and even 90% of the dialog, this would get 9 stars. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend it to people who go to the movies to see a spectacular looking period piece. Jackman and Bale do superb jobs as the centerpieces of the film's story, the supporting case is dead on (including Michael Caine - which didn't surprise me - and David Bowie - which did).But the ambitious screenplay is so riddled with sloppy plotting and unfair plot devices that it almost sinks the film.I can appreciate the difficulty of what Nolan and Nolan are trying to pull off here, and I am familiar with the work of Christopher Priest (who wrote the novel the screenplay is based on). But, simply put, the screenplay cheats like a bastard. It promises us an amazingly clever game of cat-and-mouse between two gifted and obsessive geniuses. It promises us a dazzling resolution which will astound us with its deviousness and cause us to slap our foreheads in delight, because we ""should have seen it coming"". (Kind of like some of the old ""Columbo"" episodes). ***GENERAL SPOILERS FOLLOW*** Instead it presents an out-of-left-field plot development that is completely unjustified by what went before, lies to us about the premises of another plot device that it then uses to drive the entire latter portion of the movie, and presents us with a couple of protagonists who are morally repellent and seemingly dumber than rocks.***DETAILED SPOILERS FOLLOW****I don't want to waste your time (and mine) detailing all the ways the screenplay fouls up, but I will mention a couple.1) If Angier is so devastated by his wife's death in the stage accident early in the movie (as a result of Bordon's ""carelessness"" in tying the knots), and has such a need for vengeance, it seems to be that he ought to save at least SOME of his wrath for his friend Cutter, who designed the water tank in the first place. How hard would it have been to make one of the glass sides in the water tank thin enough (say, the one in the back that the audience couldn't see directly) so that it could be broken with one swing of a sledge in an emergency? How hard would it have been to TEST the tank when it was full to see how long it actually took to break it? For that matter, how hard would it have been to train Angier's wife to hold her breath for 3 minutes - a feat any stage magician and illusionist learns very early in his career? Any of these precautions would have saved the women's life when things went wrong, yet Angier blames Borden alone.2) Early on, trying to solve the puzzle of Borden's great trick ""The Transported Man"", Angier and Cutter discard the possibility that Borden is using a look-a-like because Angier's new assistant claims that the ""double"" also has mutilated fingers, and no double could duplicate Borden's mutilated fingers. That's not valid reasoning. Times back then were tough enough that people routinely mutilated themselves so they could pass as cripples to beg for money, and women prostituted themselves for small change. Plenty of people back then (and even now) would jump at the chance to trade two fingers for a steady income and financial security. OK, I'll buy it if the film insists...these are supposed to be the smartest guys in their field, after all...BUT: What do you know! It turns out that Borden not only uses a look-a-like after all, he has a TWIN who submitted to having his fingers mutilated! I got so angry when I saw this that I nearly walked out of the theater.That's cheating - it's not clever and magician-like at all....it's just the act of an obsessive creep who doesn't have the skill or the wit to live up to the art of deception and misdirection that is supposed to be the stage magician's reason for being. Most of all, it doesn't live up to the premise that drove the latter half of the screenplay - that he's not using a double because a double wouldn't have mutilated fingers.Similarly, Angier spends years and a fortune (where'd the money come from? The movie mostly shows us performances that end in disaster!) trying to solve Borden's ""Transported Man"" trick...instead of actually simply trying to come up with a BETTER trick. The guy is supposed to be this ""brilliant"" stage magician, and yet all he can do is copy another guy's act?? Does ANYone buy this? I've just scratched the surface here: Problems and psychological inconsistencies and morally repulsive actions riddle the movie from beginning to end...not the least of which ***BIG SPOILER FOLLOWS!**** is when the Nolan brothers choose to pull a freak science fiction plot device out of nowhere in what was an interesting period mystery piece and character study. Wait a minute - the whole premise of the film is the secrecy and mystery of illusion and stagecraft. To pull a trick off with HARD SCIENCE (no matter how impressive) is to basically say, ""Nope, these characters suck, and we aren't smart enough to make our premise work. Sorry, hope you like the new direction!!"" If the acting weren't so good, if most of the dialog wasn't so spot on, if the movie didn't look so brilliant, I'd slam ""The Prestige"" non stop to everyone I know. And yet I STILL like it enough to rank it as a ""7"" when the plot barely merits a ""4"". As it is, I have to advise the first time viewer to suspend his critical thinking facilities and just drink in the mood."
" Sinister sleight of hand
",,"Cinema and stage magicians share a common secret about us, the viewers: we don't want to believe the reality - we enjoy the sensation of being transported to a world where we can gasp at the magic. ""The secret impresses no-one: the trick you use it for is everything."" Exploiting this parallel in a darkly sinister period piece, The Prestige weaves a tense and gripping tale of a fatal feud between two rival magicians.In the skilfully recreated Victorian London, Director Christopher Nolan performs another sinister and chilling sleight of hand that forces us to look closely at every frame, just as we did in his backwards-moving masterpiece Memento (about a desperate man trying to avenge his wife's murder while suffering from the loss of all short-term memory). The two magicians (played by Bale and Jackman) are poised somewhere between being scientists and conmen and risk all for the secret of the greatest stage trick - and the two women in their lives weave in and out trying to discover the inner secrets of these men with whom they are involved. Seeing the story from several angles, the viewer shifts perspectives to work out what is real.Almost like another conjuring trick, David Bowie, and to an extent all the actors except Michael Caine, are subsumed in their characters and barely recognisable at first glance. Caine, as the magician's ingeneur (the person who designs illusions behind the scenes) is a lynchpin, giving a powerful and convincing performance he can believe in. Scarlett Johansson, as the inexperienced but devoted magician's assistant, creeps up on us subtly and, thrown between the two main characters, is another one who might not be all she seems.Cutter, (Michael Caine) explains the format: ""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge: the magician shows you something ordinary, but of course, it probably isn't. The second act is called The Turn. The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now, if you're looking for the secretyou won't find it. That's why there's a third act, called The Prestige. This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" Gone is the image of the jolly magician. This is no Paul Daniels era of hocus pocus. If it goes wrong, things might get nasty. If it goes right, you are left with that gasp of amazement on your face that every magician craves and every filmmaker seeks. Perhaps the feeling is more important than deciding whether you actually want to find out or be fooled. Whodunnit or thriller, The Prestige is a rather clever piece of entertainment."
" The Most Original Movie In Recent Years
",,"Christopher Nolan's THE PRESTIGE is one of the most shockingly-original films I've ever seen; rather, the book of the same name by Christopher Priest is really the most original. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman seem ingeniously cast, with Bale as the inwardly-focused, pensive, quiet magician, and Jackman as his rival, a boastful, flashy showman. These characters also mirror the two actors' styles; Bale is more of a deeper character actor, and Jackman is, and always has been, very entertaining to watch, but his acting has always been like a bucket of buttery popcorn; it tastes good when you eat it, but you feel slightly sick after you eat it, and it has no nutritive value. Having said this, the two actors have never been better. The story is ultimately clever, albeit quite confusing at times. Much like the TV show ""Lost"", the pertinent, plot-heavy duologue is intentionally vague, leaving the audience on the edge of their seats. Just like a good magic trick - or a good Prestige, rather - the audience willingly immerses themselves in this twisting, creepy world; you WANT to be confused. (This is also the last line of the movie.) AWESOME."
" Not so much the story itself, as the way it is told - another triumph for Nolan
",spoiler,"Many stories strive on love. Occasionally, you'll find some that feed on hate, such as Wuthering Heights. The Prestige is a story that feeds on gnawing hate. Set at the turn of the century, two young assistants to a magician called Cutter (Michael Caine) start out as pals, but turn into bitter enemies and rivals when a mistake (we never know if that's intentional) committed by one causes the death of the other's wife during a performance. Borden (Christian Bale) goes off by himself, gets married and has a lovely daughter while Angier (Hugh Jackman) stays with Cutter while nursing a bitter hatred for Borden for causing the death of his wife.With Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") at the helm, you can be assured that the story is not told in a simple linear fashion. Indeed, the deft narration, in no less than three time spans, is one of the joys from watching the movie. While a little confusing at the beginning, the full picture gradually unfolds before our eyes  how Borden, accused of the murder of Angier, is waiting in jail for the gallows (the present), how Angier goes to Colorado to seek out Borden's secret (the less distant past) and how the rivalry of the two developed in the first place (the more distant past). In the process, we are also shown how they both fall in love with a beautiful stage assistant Olivier, played by the underused Scarlett Johansson.Although the twist in this movie is not really its highlight, it deserves mentioning. While enough twists and sledge-of-hand have been provided to keep the movie interesting throughout, the key theme is always there, depending on how much attention you pay. The clue is the Chinese magician's trick, which requires not only a moment's deception on stage, but an entire lifetime's charade on and off stage. That is the key. Added to that is something I, as a faithful follower of Sherlock Holmes, always have at the back of my mind - ""If you eliminate all the possibilities, whatever remains, however improbable, is the solution"".But the beauty of this movie, as I said, is not the story and plot twist, but the way it is presented. Again, this is an idea that has been explored in the movie. While Borden is a better magician, he does not have the packaging skills and stage presence of Angier. Nolan, on the other hand, certainly have what it takes to make magic out of an otherwise somewhat uninspired story and less than brilliant plot twists. He is helped by excellent art direction (particularly the Gothic set) and crisp editing that sustains a compelling pace without losing the necessary details.Performance of the two male leads shine, in different ways. Jackman has the advantage of a dashingly handsome face, which seems to bring out his best whether it's a 17th century nobleman, a vampire exterminator, or a werewolf. And he does have the stage presence required of Angier. Christian Bale is the sort of actor that does not impress at first glance, but grows on you. Once he gets into the dark side of Borden and unleashes the ominous latent energy, you'll appreciate how difficult a role it is and how well he has tackled it. While Johansson is underused, Caine demonstrates each and every time that he is the most reliable actor around today when an anchor is required for the entire movie. Quite a few people comment on David Bowie playing the eccentric inventor, but I think equally deserving is Andy Serkis who plays his assistant. While most would not recognize he face, I cannot fail to, having watched repeatedly the extended DVD of Lord of the Rings  Andy Serkis, the man who is Gollum."
" Brilliant
",,"""The Prestige"" is by far one of the best films I have seen in recent months. The actors pulled together a finely written script, and the directing was seamless. Many movies throw in ""plot fillers"" just to make up time or fill in some blank space due to lack of...something - but Christopher Nolan not only tied all the loose ends together, he threw in far more than normal and still managed to clean it up by the time the credits rolled. Yes, it makes you think, but it also makes you 'feel' the movie itself. Jackman and Bale played their roles to a ""T"" and I can't speak highly enough of them. And of course Michael Caine was brilliant. I've never been a big fan of Johansson, but I feel she really did pull this character from the pages of the script and make her real. Piper Parabo was also a fully dimensional character...a big step up from Violet Sanford. Two days later and this movie is still running through my mind in vivid images. Excellent."
" The best movie of the year
",spoiler,"Great plot! Great acting! And I guessed the secrets of the two main characters, but it was still entertaining to see the ending. The movie kept me guessing until the end.At first I thought that the male characters only used the female characters for their own advantaged-the two magicians pursue the other's secret tricks even after their wives die. But then I realized that they both loved their wives very much. The obsession still destroyed their lives, like the old man warned it would. Both are at the brink of death and we the audience are also left waiting to see what happens to them! I like not knowing more than the characters, it makes the plot so much more interesting and enticing!So worth watching. Now I want to read the book!"
" ""The Prestige""
",spoiler,"Another fall, another turn of the century tale of magicians. Seriously, why did we get ""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" in the same season? Don't confuse the two films, though. ""The Illusionist"" was a fun romp compared to director Christopher Nolan's (""Batman Begins,"" ""Memento"") take on showmanship, revenge, and evil. I would recommend not reading any more of my review if you want to be surprised by this impressive, haunting film.While ""The Illusionist"" was a movie about sleight of hand and good triumphing over evil via craftiness, ""The Prestige"" is a study of craftiness destroying. Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are magician's apprentices who both desire to someday be the greatest magician on the London stage. A tragedy early in the first act divides the men and leads to an escalating series of increasingly nasty and complicated revenge schemes.The two performers spend the film trying to one up and destroy the other. When Borden devises a trick that seemingly allows him to transport himself from one closed compartment to another, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to figure out the secret of ""The Transporting Man."" This leads him on a journey to Colorado Springs where he seeks the help of electricity wizard Nikola Tesla (David Bowie in a fantastic, subdued performance) and begins delving into actual magic/science. As Angier becomes more focused on destroying Borden, his friend and production engineer (Michael Caine) tries to temper his destructive impulses.The film uses a fascinating storytelling device that hops all over the place chronologically. Both men discover each other's diaries and this leads to a series of flashbacks upon flashbacks. Are the diaries reliable? Can we believe the stories they are telling us? As the film nears its conclusion, we keep waiting for the sleight of hand moment where we discover that the impending tragedy is just a device, a trick meant to enthrall and fool the audience. But Nolan is not Shymalan and he is crafting a genuine tragedy. No one gets out of this tale unscathed. It's a haunting film with fantastic performances and impeccable storytelling. It's a tragic epic that will alienate many audiences. They're gonna feel that they were owed a happy ending.For the more adventurous, though, this movie is worth the price of admission. For storytelling acumen alone, ""The Prestige"" is a must-see."
" The game for the young
",,"Before Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) travels to Colorado to find scientist Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), Cutter (Michael Caine), magician mentor, tells Angier, ""Obsession is the game of young men"" In Director and Writer Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" obsession spirals into deadly rivalry. The Prestige refers to the Third Act of a magic trick. In Act One: The Pledge shows the ordinary. In Act Two: The Turn, the ordinary becomes extraordinary. In Act Three: The Prestige, the twist occurs and we see something shocking. Writers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan's ""The Prestige"", based on Christopher Priest's novel, embodies these three acts. The third act of ""The Prestige"" is a shocking surprise. While watching ""The Prestige"" I guessed half of the twist, but not everything, and was completely mesmerized by the end. ""The Prestige"" starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is an engrossing dark tale of revenge that is one of the year's best.I had read that Priest's novel had an innovative narrative style where the story is retold by the rival magicians Angier and Borden, wherein the truth is revealed. Christopher Nolan and Jonathan Nolan unveil a captivating yarn through exchanged diariessee the movie. We are clued in from the on set, when Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) instructs us, ""Watch closely"" In the beginning Angier (Jackman) and Borden (Bale) are young magicians under the tutelage of Cutter (Caine). Angier's beautiful wife Julia (Piper Perabo) is a magician's assistant. However, in a magic trick turned fatal, Angier and Borden transform into enemies obsessed with revenge. Their obsession escalates into apparent murder. ""The Prestige"" perfectly casts with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Jackman and Bale are among the screen's most powerful actors. It is interesting and not coincidence that Jackman and Bale have achieved acclaims playing superheroes: Jackman as Wolverine in the ""X-Men"" movies; Bale as Batman in ""Batman Begins"". However, there are no heroes in ""The Prestige"". Director Nolan brilliantly leverages their contrasting styles and intensity. Tony Winner Jackman plays the brilliant showman Angier, who is talented, but smart enough to sense that Borden may be the more gifted magician. His hatred for Borden is boundless, even dismissing his assistant and lover Olivia (very good Scarlett Johansson) to discover Borden's secrets. Borden (Bale) is the brooding pure student of magiche has the eye. Borden marries Sarah (Rebecca Hall), and they eventually have a daughter Jess (cute Sammantha Mahurin). However, good woman Sarah suffers in the relationship of secrets. Borden becomes a star with his ""Transported Man"" trick. The jealous Angier believes that Borden is performing true magic. After several twists and turns, Angier is convinced that his own quest for 'true magic' lies with Nikola Tesla (Bowie), the Father of Magnetism. The true magic he seeks is apparently, science.Christopher Nolan (""Memento"", ""Batman Begins"") infuses a sense of wonder and tragedy in his dark tale. Ultimately, his ""The Prestige"" is about the cost of losing one's soul on the path of vengeance and fame. Hugh Jackman is simply powerful. As Angier he is a man whose life takes a dark turn, and becomes obsessed discarding almost all of his humanity. Jackman's intensity and vulnerability make Angier's quest sympathetic, but never enrolling. Jackman is masterful and charismatic in this balancing act. He has a commanding presence and voice. His performance is Oscar worthy. Equally powerful is Christian Bale as the conversely internalized Borden. His Borden is the consummate magician, always creating. Bale's intense understated performance hints at the anger and drive just below the surface. Jackman and Bale have an amazing screen partnership that is a paradox of styles. The scenes where both discover that they have been betrayed are stunning. Michael Caine is awesome as usual. Here he wonderfully floats between the two leads. His final alliance is a complete surprise. David Bowie is absolutely great as Nikola Tesla, a completely original character.Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is an unsettling tale of revenge and deadly rivalry. Nolan navigates many twists and turns arriving upon an electrifying surprise in this story of all consuming obsession. Jackman and Bale each give their best performance in Nolan's parable of forfeited souls. ""The Prestige"" is one of the year's best movies."
" Candy for the mind
",,"I did something tonight that I have never done before. I saw a first run movie, twice in the same weekend. I can't remember the last time I've seen two first run movies in the same weekend (I suspect it was in high school), I do remember the last time I saw the same movie twice in theaters (Memento).As everyone who knows me know, I'm a serious Christopher Nolan fan. Ever since I saw Memento I've been hailing him as the second coming of Alfred Hitchcock, and have the full expectation that when his career is said and done he will be universally recognized certainly as the greatest director of his time, possibly of all time. Greatness is often achieved by making a single innovation in your craft and repeating it with increasingly mastering execution. No one has ever used non-sequential time lines as effectively as Nolan did with Memento, and my one reservation about his place in Hollywood history has been that that style could never be as masterfully used in another film again... that his second work could never be equaled, let alone surpassed.The Prestige has reinforced my confidence in my initial assessment. The flash backs he used in Begins showed that he has an understanding of the technique that is unrivaled, however the use of it was not nearly as complex as it was in his early works. Prestige more follows his first work, The Following's, use of non-sequential time than Memento's in that the ordering of the scenes is very complex, by far his most complex yet. Not only are the scenes ostensibly randomly arranged, but also in parallel following the thoughts of two men at the same time. But of course the arrangement is not random, the order is there specifically to misdirect the audience... much like the magicians in the film do when performing their tricks.But it goes beyond misdirection, the scenes themselves are very powerful imagery investigating guilt, sacrifice and obsession... but the time line adds to that as well. Following seemed to use this style to add to the suspense and give the audience a little puzzle to figure out, Memento used them to do all that and force the audience to feel like the protagonist, The Prestige uses it to do everything that Memento did only the protagonist is not on screen, it is audience. With ever twist and turn you feel the mystique of a magic show, scratching your head not at how anything particular on screen happened, but how the story could come together like it does.The most amazing thing is I still can't figure out how Nolan does it, the emotions Memento and Prestige invoke when seeing them for the first time is pure ecstasy, I know of nothing that can do the same. When its over you wish you could forget everything you just saw and watch it again just to feel that way again and again. But then you watch it again anyhow, because it was so phenomenal with the expectation of not being nearly as good as the first time, and you see all the little things you missed the first time around and just marvel at the mastery of it all and get a chance to look back into the crowd and watch their jaws drop as pieces of the puzzle fall into place.9/10: Not quite Memento but close. My only misgiving is was I was I had the puzzle together enough to see the big picture about half way through the film, although I know only one person thus far who has had the same experience. Expect to see lots of 10's on this one, they're well deserved."
" Incredibly complex plot that will keep you guessing until the last seconds of film.
",,"The Prestige was an incredibly deep and twisted film. The plot is fairly hard to follow and for I while I would think things like ""is this the past or the present"" but soon I realized that it didn't really matter what it was, because in the end everything comes together. The movie keeps you on the edge of your seat guessing, right up until the last seconds of the film. These last few seconds will make you say ""Wow, I get it now"" and you will realize that Innocent scenes earlier in the film have significant importance. The special effects are great and the acting is very well done. The movie draws many parallels with another recently released ""magician"" film - The Illusionist, but the action and intensity of The Prestige makes for a more exciting and enjoyable experience. A backstage view of how some magic tricks are done also adds to the enjoyment. Highly recommended, definitely worth the price of admission."
" Are you watching closely?
",,"2006 has certainly been the year for very similar movies being released in pairs. First both Hollywoodland and The Black Dahlia slunk onto mainstream screens, both having almost identical plots set in the same time frame. Then came Infamous, another take on the Truman Capote story, which won Philip Seymour Hoffman the best actor academy award last year. And now, the theme of deception and magic seems to have infiltrated the screens, with the emergence of The Illusionist, starring Edward Norton, and... Christopher Nolan's The Prestige, detailing the story of two rival magicians constantly competing to upstage the other, their deadly game reaching increasingly higher stakes. Although comparisons between The Illusionist and Prestige may seem inevitable, safe to say that both are very strong films with admittably incredibly similar plot lines, but in terms of a superior, in areas where Illusionist stumbles, The Prestige seems only to soar, seeming to surpass all audience expectations. Just when the audience feels like they have figured out every last trick The Prestige has to offer, Nolan pitches them a new handful to wrack their brains over. Rather than getting caught up and getting lost in this convoluted structure, the film seems to revel in it, each twist seeming to only improve the quality and intrigue of the film. It's a testament to Christopher Nolan's incredible skill as a director and writer that he has shown such a run of success in film-making, having had arguably nothing less than a hit thus far, starting with his barely financed but incredibly successful thriller Momento, all the way to last year's incredibly well made Batman Begins, one of the strongest superhero films to date. Nolan seems to really thrive on unusual plot structures, showing a tendency to start the film right before the end of the story, then flashback throughout the course of the film, with occasional jumps back and forth in the storyline to keep the viewers watching closely. (Batman Begins also used this exact structure) It also goes without saying that Nolan retains his usual eye for costumes and set design, and the Victorian age has never looked so sumptuous as under the eyes of Nolan. He is without a doubt one of the most innovating and interesting directors around these days, and we can only hope a Batman sequel is indeed in the cards for him.Another major aspect in which The Prestige surpasses all potential peers is in the phenomenal cast. If such a cast has been assembled anytime of late, it is unlikely it was to such powerful effect, as each cast member contributes a simply wonderful performance to an already astonishing film. The casting of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale alongside each other is already enough to provoke mouth watering in about 98% of the population, whether admiring them for talent, looks, or the prospect of Wolverine and Batman sparring off. Either way, they are easily the acting standouts, and both deliver Oscar nomination worthy performances endowed with incredible charisma and skill. (Jackman comes across as the stronger, seeming a bit more emotionally genuine, but it's debatable as to which is the more acclaim worthy as they both deliver such sublime performances) Michael Caine is a classy and brilliant touch as the engineer Cutter, and a rare appearance from David Bowie as electrical inventor Nikola Tesla is a perfect piece of casting, as Bowie's appearance in the film seems to rival that of his character: elusive, exciting and and mysterious. Scarlett Johansson delivers a fine performance as Jackman's character's stage hand, despite several cringe-worthy slips of her Cockney accent, and Rebecca Hall has a somewhat repetitive role to deal with as Bale's character's wife, but still gives a great performance in the end. And of course, it's always great to see the vastly underrated Andy Serkis give yet another top notch performance as Tesla's assistant. All in all, The Prestige is an incredibly classy and powerful film event - packed with more twists and turns than any viewer, no matter how clever would be able to predict, and fueled with an astonishing cast giving wonderful performances, headed all the while by careful yet powerful writing and directing, on the part of Nolan, who can seem to do no wrong. We can only hope that more movies of this caliber come to theaters soon, as The Prestige is one of the most interesting, genuinely gripping and entertaining thrillers in recent film history. -9.5/10"
" This Movie is Excellent
",,"This movie is truly excellent. For some reason this website is full of negative comments on films. The people behind the writing and directing of this film are the same people that made Memento. The acting is superb. The twists are very well done. The trailers don't give away what the movie is about and you are kept on the edge of your seat until the final scene. If you have read any reviews from people that said that they couldn't follow the plot or are unsure as to what the true ending meant or anything to do with confusion in the plot they are people that need to go back and watch the movie again. This plot is very intelligent, but when you pay attention - the pay off is grand. Brilliant film making, I look forward to seeing this movie again. This is the best film I have seen this year and the fact that I feel so strong about it is why I came to this website to write about it."
" Most confusing movie!
",,"I HATED this film. From the mumbling bumbling dialog to the so-called ""twisted"" ending.... Did not know who was who... so you all say that what was great about it.... I didn't think so. I found it very hard to follow. Worst movie I've seen in a long time. Did not know what was going on, past, present or future....who knows. I had a very difficult time understanding what Christian Bale was saying, they all spoke so softly, plus the accents! The movie ended and all I could say was what a waste of time. It was way too long too! Save yourself a lot of thinking and see The Illusionist! Much, much better movie, better acting and very entertaining!"
" ""It is inhuman to be so cold""...
",,"""It is inhuman to be so cold"", says one of the film's characters, and that's what ""The Prestige"" (2006) directed by Christopher Nolan is above all. It is technically well done, it is dark, it is twisted (too many twists to my taste) and it could be described as ""Memento"" meets ""Rashômon"" judging by the way the story of obsession, rivalry, hatred, and losing all human feelings has been told. Yes, it is well done by in the end I don't care about any of its main characters because more than anything, their story reminds of Atreus and Thyestes, two brothers from the Greek Mythology where each would go very far to hurt and to humiliate the sibling. The tricks are magic but when there is nothing but hatred (and some science fiction thrown in for more effect) behind the magic, I don't want to be tricked. I prefer ""The Illusionist"" that was released the same year -there is love and light behind the secrets and tricks, and I want to stay there."
" The Prestige is one of those movies you just can't help but admire.
",spoiler,"The Prestige is a movie that makes you feel awed when you walk out of the cinema after seeing it. Not only does it entertain (and that is something it does exceptionally well) but it makes you think for a long time after. The final twist leaves you amazed and exhilarated. It includes magic, love, women, money, travel, self-sacrifice and all these factors put together by an excellent cast make the whole thing spectacular. Christian Bale is unforgettable as the charming Cockney who is charged for the murder of his rival, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Caine is wonderful in the traditional role of 'wise mentor' and gives the movie that extra sparkle.However, a dishonorable mention has to be made about the 'Alfred Borden twin scenario'. Its just a little bit predictable. However, some might say, that the twin scenario (being the most predictable) would be the one least expected, as every viewer will expect something absolutely jaw-dropping (like everything else in the film). The Prestige is an excellent example of film, and might even be the best movie of the year."
" Implausible story
",,"The ""ultimate magic trick"" mentioned in the plot outline on IMDb involves such an unbelievable and unlikely happening that it conflicts with other thematic elements, and leaves one wondering whether this is a science fiction movie or a period movie about magicians. The whole plot is contrived. The movie is not compelling as a whole, only in parts. The acting is fine, but the dialog is often hard to follow--lines spoken too quickly and not distinctly. Don't expect a bright and sunny movie either--most scenes are filmed in dark and dingy sets. The movie starts out alright--two magicians competing for the best trick, but soon the plot devolves into a series of events where each main character seeks the ""ultimate magic trick."" Don't be fooled: this so-called ""ultimate magic trick"" is completely implausible, so the movie looses credibility and believability. If the movie had developed this part of the plot with more emphasis and detail it might have made for a more interesting movie, but as it is, the movie doesn't know if it wants to be a serious drama or a science fiction thriller."
" Waste of Talent
",,"Bale, Jackman, and Caine, now that sounded like it should've been the best movie one could've wanted to see at theatre. I give you at first I kept thinking it was sort of like Batman versus Wolverine. This movie had the potential to be a great film but at best it was a mediocre attempt at a mysterious period piece. The two main characters were unsympathetic and the others were merely window dressings for their obsessions. I am not really all that much of a Caine fan but I can easily say that he did the best performance of these actors. Even though most of the acting was barely on par, the script and editing were far worse. The timing and movement of this piece took it from a passable film to dreadfully long one. The problem with its length is that it gives you so much time that you figured out all the twists and after that what's the point? I felt mislead with this film as well, it was far more of a revenge flick than a historical fiction. If you are interested in magicians and period pieces try the Illusionist. It was a much better constructed film."
" terrible
",spoiler,"It's a movie with a twist that puts it into the realm of unbelievable fantasy crap. And, had me so angry that I wish I had asked for my money back.Why not have space aliens land and be in control of the apparent show? That's how ridiculous, absurd and stupid the film is.The first twist, one magician is actually twins sacrificing their happiness for the magic is great, unpredictable and realistic. I thought the film was going to be brilliant.But, the second, that a man had discovered a replicator, and kept it hidden for his own magic trick while killing himself every night... left me so empty and angry I wish I had never seen the film. What sort of twist is that? Its not even a twist, its a departure from a good film to a very very very bad one."
" Simply Christopher Nolan!
",,"The best director to ever do it. So well rounded, when a man knows what he is doing the results are obviousl. The scrips is 10/10 the acting is 10/10 the directing is 10/10. WATC IT YOU WANT REGRET IT."
" An Absolute Delight...A Must-Watch..!
",,My Rating : 8/10Does Christopher Nolan ever put a foot wrong? This is miraculous! The Prestige easily is a solid 8/10 for me. Great film for repeated viewings with a brilliantly paced narrative and brilliant acting from all the leads.It's a Chris Nolan movie. Go watch it!
" Very average
",,After reading the reviews had high hopes but to be honest very disappointed. Good cast and well acted but the twists and turns never really happened.... I had already guessed the outcome and you don't have to be a genius!
" Suspend Disbelief...Then Enjoy
",spoiler,"Magic requires suspension of disbelief.Disbelief that Telsa invents a transportation machine, but the transported items are really clones of the original. So what happens to the original? ""A little bit more work and I'll have that solved"" says Telsa. We must belief that Angier (Hugh Jackman) drowns himself every perfprmance so his clone can instantly appear on the balcony?Disbelief that Borden (Christian Bale) is hanged for a murder he did not commit. The final scene shows all the Angier clones drowned in their watertanks. The cops never checked backstage, to figure out Angier killed himself? Not even the Judge, who asked for a private disclosure of the magic trick during the trial?So where is the magic? The magic is that the movie is really interesting and entertaining, as long as the viewer suspends all possible disbelief.The price of the ticket is worth just seeing Scarlett Johansson in the low-bosom-cut period dress. Her figure is magic all by herself."
" Very Well Made Magic Tale
",spoiler,"Christopher Priest's novel is given a class A film treatment here. With Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan's top notch screenplay, and Christopher's Directing talents, this film comes off very well.Michael Caines Cutter character is good and his being the narrator is even better. Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, and Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, the feuding magic men, and Scarlett Johanssons role as Olivia, the woman assistant between them are well acted roles.Magic and deception are the keys to the plot. There is a little romance but the key elements here are the feud between the men, who will stop at nothing to outwit each other.In the beginning, one lovely lady assistant dies as the result of a mistake by one of these guys when they are doing a joint act. After that, they split up because the dead woman was a wife of one of them. Then the rivalry begins.They claw each other until the death trying to find out each others secrets. This all takes place in the late 19th century, and the settings for this are magnificent. There are 3 elements to each magic act, and the final curtain is the Prestige, where the audience gets something they do not expect.In the case of this film, you have to watch the end of it to get what the movie viewer does not expect. It is very much worth watching. Very good film making here and the Nolans would go on to do Inception later on. This is a solid effort that shows how they got to the later film."
" Pretty people in pretty costumes
",,"As sometimes happens in Hollywood, two films with extremely similar plots are released the same year—Capote and In Cold Blood, Florence Foster Jenkins and The Florence Foster Jenkins Story, The Darkest Hour and Churchill—Christopher Nolan's The Prestige came out the same year as Neil Burger's The Illusionist. If you watch the previews to both, you'll find it nearly impossible to tell apart, since they're both about magicians in 1890s England, both starring dark haired men, women with full lips, and an older mentor gentleman. Both plots seem to dance around someone who will stop at nothing in his quest to find out the truth behind the magic tricks. I've seen both films all the way through, and I still have trouble telling them apart.If you're looking for eye candy to go along with your magician story, The Prestige is the one to rent. Hugh Jackman, in his clean-cut handsomeness, is the star. If you liked him in Kate and Leopold, you'll be very happy to hear he looks almost identical in The Prestige. He and Christian Bale spar off one another, since they both seem to be master illusionists—oh, wait, that's the word from the other film. Anyway, Scarlett Johansson is Hugh's girlfriend and assistant, and Rebecca Hall, David Bowie, Andy Serkis, and Roger Rees join the supporting cast.Christopher Nolan, creator of the slew of Batman remakes, cast two of his favorite actors in this film after working with them in Batman Begins: Christian Bale and Michael Caine. It's really nice to see the actors and actresses working well off each other, which isn't particularly surprising since most of them worked together in various films before. While some of the twists and turns of the plot are entertaining, as is usual with a Christopher Nolan script, as the end credits roll, audiences are able to find some flaws if they choose to think about it. However, if you like Nolan's films, or magic movies, or like to watch pretty people in pretty costumes, rent this one for an entertaining evening."
" What to write?
",spoiler,"*****Warning!!! Definite Spoilers!!!*****The Pledge? Appears to start out in an interesting way.The Turn? Well there's some intrigue and a few clues as to where things may be leading.The Prestige? Unfortunately for me, this is where the film splits into 2 halves. One of which is close to brilliant, the other descends into farce. Luckily the farcical element does disappear somewhat for the film to reach a rather thrilling climax. The Borden/Fallon half is quite superb. After the ""discovery"" of Tesla inventing cloning though, the Angiers half underwhelms me. I was half expecting the DVD to have a bonus feature of how Sir Isaac Newton invented the levitation of apples but my copy must be missing that chapter. Maybe I just have an issue with the retro-fitting of science fiction into a plot set in the past.It's beautifully filmed with gorgeous cinematography and the acting is mostly first class but I do wish Mr Nolan would use a steadi-cam device a bit more often. Close-ups, especially at indoor locations, where the background is waving around is something I find particularly distracting.Since on any given day I could probably rate this anywhere between a 3 and a 7 based on my personal boundaries of disbelief. (As Cutter says, ""you want to be fooled"". But I say, yeah sure but not conned). So I shall be relatively generous and stick with a 6Now I'm no writer but instead of stockpiling 99 other dead bodies for the cops to miraculously NOT find whilst investigating a murder.... What if...... the story had hinged on the Tesla machine not actually working, and Angiers engineering some foolproof plan to get Borden or Fallon backstage on a particular night when Root falls into the tank...........Well, wouldn't that have been amazing. Talking of which, what did happen to Root????I guess we're not meant to care about the guy in the box."
" The Best Movie Ever Made
",,"I'm going to be specific. For God's shake, this movie captivated my attention since the very first image, the very first line. Every scene, every second of this wonderful movie is a stoned masterpiece that no one ever will top. The prove that this is the most stunning mind- blowing epic movie ever made is that after watching it for first, or second or third time (whatever), you try to understand the puzzle for a week. I seriously want to cry, because of this film, I will never watch something better. Thank you, Nolan. Long live the king."
" Nolan's sloppiest flick!
",spoiler,"Now, this might probably be the most unpopular opinion. So if you are a Nolan fan who gets easily offended, just scroll away. If you are still here, let's start.Nolan is a magician. He truly is. His work has a pledge, a turn and an applaud-worthy prestige. He captures everyone's imagination really well. Except for the critics, who are actually not there to be fooled. Yes critics still desire to be fooled but something as sloppy as this just can't.Now I am not saying this movie is a mess. It is well crafted. It's narration (running in three timelines) is a piece of art. Some people may have found it annoying but lets be honest that is what his distraction was in this magic show. If you look carefully, however, you might not get distracted. Now, I had already received the spoiler about Alfred Bordon. It didn't take me long to know who Fallon was and why some day Alfred meant his ""I love you"" to his wife. However other turns are well placed. Christopher talks about presentation in this movie and why a great magic piece will not receive as many claps as a sloppier one presented in a classy suspenseful way. That is what Nolan is great at. Now, to find out that Cutter was right about the Transported Man trick all along would have been painfully disappointing for the viewers who were at the edge of their seat to find out about the 'greatest trick ever!' But how well did Mr Nolan knit his story around the whole thing? He included personal conflicts, professional conflicts, self-conflicts, career politics, romantic drama all in the turn and presented a 'lame trick' in a classy way and I am not disappointed. So what did disappoint me? How Nolan let go of some untied pieces. Now, Cutter and Angier have keen eye for magic secrets. Cutter is an ingenieur who has identified some of the most intricate tricks with great ease. How then did they not recognize who Fallon was when they kidnapped him. How difficult was it to identify a fake demeanour for some of the best magicians? Additionally, from the maker of some of the best science fictions ever released, it was definitely not expected that he would mess up a simple 9th grade basics about clone. I let go of the technicality behind the cloning process because ""it is a fiction"" but how did the clone created have the same memory and same experiences? Every kid, who has basic knowledge of biology, knows that clones just have the same DNA, their behaviour and memory are entirely different. Such major mistakes in what could have been one of his best flicks, took away from the movie. I am terribly disappointed but for the Nolan's art direction I am going with a six-out-of-ten. It is still worth a watch."
" The Prestige
",,"A truly great movie that keeps the audience anticipating what is going to happen next throughout. ALIST cast, along with a master director. A film that doesn't receive the credit it deserves. Doesn't stick to a particular genre and holds acting performances that I believe Oscar worthy. Hugh Jackman, the gifted method actor swaps his aggressive wolverine blades and plays a obsessive magician who holds every card in his pocket; the love of showmanship. However, Jackman isn't the only magician in this monumental tale of rivalry. Christian Bale also plays as his bitter rival. Bale, being the best magician in my opinion, although he doesn't hold the same characteristics and showmanship as Jackman, it is hard not to be fooled by the magicians mysterious ways and Bales tremendous acting displaying his love for magic and trickery. A love story for the obsession of magic and being a entertainer surrounds the movie, along with other hard hitting life events. Loved ones lost from Both sides, this tale of two men fighting against each other is sure to keep you guessing while you crunch on your movie food and it is nearly impossible to predict what happens next from beginning to end."
" Run from the hype. Really. Run.
",spoiler,"I watched the movie (and read the book) because IMDb reviewers slammed ""Now You See Me"" and said real magic movies, like The Prestige and the Illusionist, are what filmmaking is all about. Well, I can say the Prestige was better than the Illusionist. And both were pieces of crud.Enter the adaptation of a bad book, The Prestige. The setup is simple - two rival magicians try to outdo each other, and their game escalates until people start getting seriously hurt. That should be easy enough to pull off, no? No. Here comes the sci-fi element that has absolutely nothing to do with the illusions the magicians were attempting before. Suddenly, what could have been a believable, but slow, plodding, and boring, period tale is now utter nonsense. And, the critical details about the sci-fi element are only told at the very end of the movie. At least the book let you warm up to the nonsense.The relationship between Bale and Johansen gets exactly two lines. And that is an incredibly important part of the story! The book treats this better, and the book was awful.This could be the movie that keeps me off of IMDb forever. You people are nuts if this is a 8/9 out of 10. The only good part of the experience was knowing I got the movie from the library, so this nonsense didn't cost me a dime."
" Derailed by its own Prestige
",spoiler,"The Prestige opens and closes with Michael Caine's stage engineer Cutter informing us of the three acts behind every magic trick. The pledge: setting up something that seems ordinary (a bird), the turn: making that thing do something extraordinary (the bird disappears), and the prestige: restoring that thing to reality (the bird reappears). The final of the three, which is meant to be the hardest to achieve, is the key to the trick working. It's eerie then that the film collapses within the most crucial area. Its own prestige. Nolan's film is effectively a game of showmanship between two rival magicians. How when one performs a trick that seems impossible, the other drives himself to the edge in order to figure out its secret. The film isn't really about magic. It's more about the magic in creating the perfect illusion. Yet it goes on to deal with heavier themes. Most notably the dangers of obsession. How our lead Robert Angier is frequently told that his obsession with his rival Alfred Borden will lead to grave consequences, and it eventually does. It's themes of obsession, guilt and deceit are so well handled that the film could have been about anything. The fact that both men happen to be magicians just adds to the overall mystique.The trick itself is known as the 'Transported Man' and involves Borden entering a door on one side of the stage and emerging immediately from a door on the other side. Angier is convinced that a double is being used, despite Cutter claiming that it isn't possible, and sets up someone to look just like him. Of course the act is a success, until Borden sabotages it and leaves Angier even more determined to work out the secret. This is a fantastic pledge that the story has created. It leads to Angier travelling to snowy Colorado in order to find electricity genius Nikola Tesla (a fictionalised take on the man, played by David Bowie) who he believes can help him.Both lead characters are strangely underwritten. It's understandable why the stern Borden and more flamboyant Angier would become rivals (and that's even without the death of Angier's wife to provide some forced conflict), but we know barely anything about them as individuals. Take away their obsessions and there is little below the surface. We need deeper insight to know what makes these men tick and in order to understand why they are taking such massive risks. It relies on actors with big screen presences to make the roles appear interesting, something that Bale and Jackman just about manage to accomplish.What balances this out is its excellent directing, cinematography and pacing. Nolan's use of place and atmosphere has always been one of his strong points. He breathes life into his representation of early 1900's London and of the darkness that is consuming his leads. This is also one of the most clinical uses of a time shifting narrative I have seen, nothing seems awkwardly placed or moved. Nolan's prowess is what guides us through the pledge, but can he complete the cycle and deliver the ultimate prestige? Well, is it possible for the payoff to totally derail a film? Yes, and here is the perfect example. The film constantly tells us to look at the smaller details, to 'look closer', that understanding the illusion is everything and that the cleverest ruse is what ultimately matters. It spends the entire run time telling us that magic isn't real or of any importance. But Angier's master trick can only be explained by magic. The audience has basically been deceived, in entirely the wrong way, by this 'twist'. The Sci-Fi elements that enter the fore in order to make the payoff work clash with everything, mainly because the film has been so heavily based in realism and real trickery. So what is it telling us? That everything that it talked about was a lie? It somehow manages to ruin its own prestige with such a convoluted and nonsensical twist.The films climax is almost nothing but twists and turns. Scenes revealing that nothing was ever as it seems and deception was constantly taking place. I'm a big fan of films that have twists that leave you in awe or amazed. But the twist here is so left-field and against the very principal of the story that it ends up effectively derailing entire sections of the film, making sequences illogical in every aspect. It saddens me, because I was extremely impressed by the film on a technical level. The story was intriguing and it felt as if it was building to the most impressive payoff it could. Instead, we're left confused and irritated as the film simply throws the rule book out the window for its climax and decides its own fate."
" An entertaining thriller but I've seen better films from Nolan
",,"This is a good movie as a whole but I feel that Nolan overdid it on the plot twists this time. In my opinion, Memento and Inception are much better films.2 rival stage magicians attempt to outdo one another by performing their magic show and trying to cause as much damage as possible to the other one's career after a tragic accident.The films score is just okay. It fits great with the movie but I didn't find it as listenable on its own. Its combination of notes and chords isn't anything new that we haven't seen before. I feel that its music is just sound effects which are choreographed well with the film.Nolan is known for his elaborate, non-linear movie plots. Here, he relied on plot twist after plot twist before the final major plot twist at the end. Although this made for some good scenes, I feel that he overdid it way too much. After 1 plot twist happens, it confuses you for a bit. But before you're able to catch your breath, the movie hits you with another plot twist and it makes you more frustrated. The movie does it several times during the movie. I was eventually able to understand its plot but I didn't have as much fun trying to figure it out as I did with Nolan's other movies. Also, you have to suspend a lot of disbelief at the ending. I felt like it was done just for the sake of it in this case.However, despite what I said, I do feel that this is a pretty good movie. It has great acting from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, great cinematography and lighting, and most of the film up to the end is thoroughly entertaining. It's really only the ending which truly upset me. So in conclusion, this is a nice film and all but I've personally seen better movies from Nolan."
" Nolan's Films Are Nothing Short Of Magic
",spoiler,"Cutter (Michael Caine) - Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before.How fitting then that these three acts are exactly what Christopher Nolan presents his audience with in his latest masterpiece ""The Prestige."" I imagine it must be difficult for critics of Nolan's work to read reviews composed by others where terms like ""masterpiece"" are substituted for plebeian words such as ""movie"" or ""film."" However the simple fact of the matter is that Nolan has a gift for making movies and ""The Prestige"" is no exception.Nolan's latest work centers on two rival magicians who set out to steal the secrets of one another's work after a series of unfortunate events have unfolded. But it's not just Nolan who made the film, it was also the cast. Christian Bale continues to reinforce the idea that he is one of the most dedicated and versatile actors of our time. This guy's rise to the top is simply an example of ""hard work pays off."" He plays his character so well that at times you love him and at others you pity him. The same can be said about Hugh Jackman who goes beyond playing a ""mutant with claws."" Of course nothing needs to be said of the great Michael Caine but the performance I was most surprised with was that of Scarlet Johansson's. She's come a long way from playing the squeaky and somewhat whiny clone in Michael Bay's ""The Island"" and succeeded in this movie by passing herself off as both a bright and cheery maiden and a scorned assistant. The characters themselves stand in a sort of gray area. No one is truly good or truly evil. There is no black and white. This coincided with the idea of ""living the act"" whereby one of the characters suggests that a true magician is always a magician. On the street, in his home, in front of a crowd or on his own. He must live his entire life as his stage persona if he desires to fool everyone during a performance and with that we are kept guessing as to who the protagonist and antagonist are. ""Never reveal your secrets"" he says ""or they'll never respect you again."" *Spoilers* I must admit that this film was much darker than I had anticipated. For some reason I felt like the previews led me to believe that I'd be dazzled by magic tricks when in fact the majority of the tricks performed are interfered with by the two on screen rivals. The first words that came to mind when we were presented with a few ""truths"" behind the tricks of certain magicians were gritty and shocking. We get a first hand look at how magicians were and are often forced to ""get their hands dirty"" in order to get the standing ovation they seek. This brutal honesty was an effective device employed by Nolan that helped to keep you guessing if they were ""going to do that again"" as the characters made preparations for their next round of tricks. The film itself is also very thematic often examining the juxtaposition of a pair of concepts. Inventing versus stealing, magic versus science etc..Cinematographywise enough good things can't be said. The scene where Jackman is standing amidst a field of light bulbs was eye popping and the sets themselves are very convincing. However the most effective trick Nolan has up his sleeve is his signature ""flash of memory"" shots where as a character speaks of the past we get quick glimpses via rapid flashbacks. Nolan also has a knack for telling stories by placing key plot points out of chronological order and he really pulled out all the stops here. Smart moviegoers may pick up a few things here or there before they are revealed but the entire story is kept well shrouded until the very end.And what an ending it was. Considering all the praise I've given this film you're probably thinking to yourself ""then why a 9 and not a 10?"" Well for starters this movie was a tad drawn out. This minor gripe coupled with one other thing are the only complaints I had and that one complaint was the supernatural angle no one saw coming. I won't go so far as to spoil it completely with specifics, but let's just say that there's a point in the film when the theme of slight of hand versus wizardry or stage magic versus science is meant to be taken literally. This is the film's make or break angle. Once the secret is revealed will you still respect the magician (Nolan) and his trick (The Prestige)? Nolan seems to think so. The ending is great in that it's conclusive or open depending upon your interpretation of the events which have taken place on screen. It is what you make it out to be. It is VERY rare that such an ending exists but the final moments of ""The Prestige"" are a testament to how conclusions such as these should be pulled off. According to the film ""A real magician tries to invent something new, that other magicians are gonna scratch their heads over."" In my opinion the same should ring true for directors and that's certainly the case with ""The Prestige."" 9/10"
" Memento (10/10), Batman Begins (10/10), Prestige (You do the Math)
",,"WOW! It's been a long time since we've seen a decent film that excels in almost all aspects. Direction, Cinematography, Editing, Acting, to name a few, were all just amazing. Then again after Memento and Batman Begins...could we've expected anything less from ace director Christopher Nolan. The Prestige keeps you guessing throughout the movie and alternates the role of 'good guy' and 'bad guy' between the two protagonists with such subtlety that by the end you're not biased to one or the other character, rather, you understand where each of them is coming from. A strong story and good acting by both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman make this film even more gripping. Scarlet Johanssen puts in her two cents...but is overshadowed by the male leads. I must say...one of the best films I've seen! 10/10"
" Cast wasted... It's remarkably uninteresting
",spoiler,"The perfect example of a great cast wasted. It's a remarkably uninteresting movie in which the ""surprise"" ending was pitifully easy to spot. The fact that the ending was obvious is secondary to the fact that each of the main characters were extremely unlikable individuals. What a waste of talent.The film is a pale shadow of the source material. The director tries to misdirect the viewer with an intricate flashback structure that begins at a trial, before time-traveling through the lives of the magicians as young men. The magicians fall in love with various women while escalating their nasty attempts to expose, outdo and injure each other.Their obsession to obtain each other's trade secrets and become the most esteemed illusionist becomes dull and falls somewhere on the scale between weird science and bad science, this plot development adds another layer of nonsense to the drama. There's no real magic here. For more likable characters and better sleight-of-hand storytelling, see The Illusionist."
" Worst script ever!
",spoiler,"Worst script ever!!! Worst scenario ever!!! The plot is total nonsense!!! Only the performance of the actors is awesome. This movie has total lack of common sense. The ending is complete nonsense! I do not want to write spoilers here explaining the situation, but I have to - just ask yourself - if the machine was able to produce clones why Robert Anger was killed? And he also was betrayed without any reason by two people - his assistant Olivia and his friend Cutter. Does anybody want to explain why? This is more fiction than that Tesla machine - friends usually do not betray with no reason... I did not enjoy this movie because of a huge lack of a common sense..."
" Long, boring, and stupid
",spoiler,"This movie is a complete waste of time. The main characters are dull and poor actors. The whole plot seems inconceivable, on top of mundane and predictable. Instead of having a clever and interesting solution they resort to everyone has a clone. The characters have no depth whatsoever. They have nothing outside of their obsessions. Full of illogical twists and turns that make no sense whatsoever - what the hell does Tesla have to do with anything? Why wouldn't anyone notice the clones?Just don't see this movie, long, boring, horrible plot, and waste of time."
" FULL OF TWISTS.

" OH MY GOODNESS!

" The best I've seen

" Are you watching closely?

" Entertaining drama

" Well conceptualized and executed, a magical panorama
",,"1.Genre- drama, mystery2. Rating- 7.5/103. One liner- Greatly entertained till the end, story line is quite unpredictable till the end. Well created by director Nolan4. Plot summary- Story revolves around two magicians Mr. Alfred Borden and Mr. Robert Angier who fight to outcast other over the trick of illusion and magic. To prove one dominant over other.
And they ought to loose on the path while doing it. 5. Events- The magic trick shown by Mr. Angier at the end when he used the machine created by Tesla mixing both science and magic6. Film making- 1800's era was well conceptualized along with all the costume work. It was commendable. And of course the famous dialogue there are three stages of magic!!- The pride where you show something ordinary, The turn- where you turn the ordinary into extraordinary and last is the prestige that is for the audiences to define!!7. Potential viewers- I guess who are well familiar with Christopher Nolan movies along with a top notch star cast. And to those who want to be amazed till the end.8. Verdict- Thumbs up!!"
" Abracadabra!
",,"The Prestige' tells the tale of two rival magicians at the turn of last century who constantly try to outdo each other at every turn. The premise may sound a little so-so, but, trust me, the finished product is anything but. It's magic. First of all it's a Christopher Nolan film - a writer/director who is one of the most respected and profitable working today. But, no matter how well he does in the director's chair, it's the cast who make it what it is.I know that the term 'assemble cast' is normally associated with films like 'The Avengers' where every major character is a star in their own right, but 'The Prestige' isn't far off attaining this label. The two magicians in question are played by Christian 'Batman' Bale and Hugh 'Wolverine' Jackman and, obviously, the film focuses in on them. However, there's plenty of extra acting talent supporting their personal grievances with each other, namely Michael Caine, David Bowie, Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall - all of which play their parts to perfection no matter how much screen time they're given.It's really a story about obsession - how two men start off as friends, but, through a string of unfortunate events (and the desire never to share a stage and be 'the best' in their own rights!) they dedicate their lives to outdo each other, no matter how much it costs them. There's a fair amount of tragedy to the tale as both men suffer blows to their personal life in pursuit of their quests for revenge (and to introduce the perfect magic trick to their audiences) and you can't help but feel for them on more than one occasion.I really would recommend 'The Prestige' to anyone wanting to watch a truly great modern classic. However, if I was to try and find a few flaws in it, I'd probably warn people that it's hardly fast-paced and quite long compared to the average ninety minute runtime. Plus the story does bounce around in time, meaning you'll see the end first and find yourself having the middle narrated by one character, before popping back to the beginning and finding a different member of the cast telling you what's happening. It does work, but it will force you to concentrate on what time period you're watching (check your phone at your peril and you may run the risk of becoming totally confused!).However, perhaps my personal only gripe with the film was that all the way through I thought it was based in reality. The magicians are just that - tricksters like any other stage show act you'd see today. However, without straying into 'spoiler territory' I have to warn you that this film's genre ends up being 'science fiction.' But, if you know what you're watching you should really get quite a lot out of this film on many levels."
" My review is a spoiler. Well, the whole movie in itself is a spoiler
",spoiler,"Rivalry between two magicians is a new concept explored by Christopher Nolan. It's originality is it's strength. It's weakness is it's predictability. Two and half hours long , but I still found this engaging till end. But the ending didn't go well with me. The ending is not exactly the ending . It gave away all the plot in about 2/3rd of movie. It was already known that Angier uses a double and that Borden must have used one . That double being a twin is not a surprise. And that the machine produces an another double is quite obvious when Angie dropped the hat and Tesla said 'All are yours'. And was it that difficult to tell Olivia that they were twins? Only good twist at the end was Angier being Lord Cadlow. I like the movie only for the first 110 minutes and not for the last 20. Due to Nolan's fine storytelling. The only bad part is when it tries to be intelligent without having that sort of story."
" Great entertainment, though it pigeonholes itself there
",,"This movie is very engaging and intriguing. You are presented with a complete mess of scenes which go back and forth through time and are needlessly confusing, yet the core story and the characters were compelling enough to keep me interested and paying attention. The cinematography, the sound, the acting, and the visual elements are all perfectly in place, and overall its very entertaining.My only concern is that the film prevents itself from achieving greatness by relying heavily on a very cheap, shallow plot element. It becomes science fiction, which is fine but a bit strange after spending so long convincing me the characters are real. This is something I find with all of Nolan's movies, that they present themselves as being mysterious and secretive but fall a little flat if you apply any brain power to them.Still, I think this movie is worth watching if you're looking for something a little suspenseful, a little creepy, and very entertaining. Maybe the movie's ultimate goal is the same as a magician's, as said in the movie: that one moment where the audience is in awe and disbelief."
" Great performance.
",,"It's best to not reveal anything about the plot as it's not fun to ruin the moment, just like magic tricks. Instead, I'll mention a few things about The Prestige. Go with the open mind, and I'll promise you love it.The Prestige is well directed and written (you can thank Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan for that). While I haven't read the original novel, apparently Christopher Priest was completely surprised by what he was seeing, so I can guess that anyone, who has read the original novel, will like this movie too. Excellent cast. Everyone gave their best, but I did find Andy Serkis a bit weird but you can't blame him. You already know where his fame came from and you can't unsee it. Other than that, no complaints. You can see Nolan likes to use same actors in his movies. I do think that maybe Christian Bale was the best actor, and I'm not surprised by that. The man knows how to give a good performance. Hugh Jackman was also good. It's always a relief that he has a talent to play roles that aren't Wolverine (not that he was bad in it, he's great) This movie isn't special effect heavy as other movies directed by Nolan but you can compare it to Memento, despite the differences in themes. Just like Memento, it's more of a thriller and drama than an action movie. The Prestige does show a pretty convincing impression of the end of the 19th century. No CGI backgrounds that look bland. The editing, music and cinematography is standard good quality you would expect.There were a few moments which I did find questionable, and as something that could break the suspension of disbelief. Luckily, I wasn't bothered that much and those moments were only a few.I don't want to give too much credit to Nolan brothers as I don't want to discredit anyone else that were involved in the movie but if you like their work, I'm 100% sure that you will like this movie just like the others. It may require a repeated viewing to some people but I don't consider it a bad thing. I highly recommend The Prestige."
" The awesome hidden truth!
",spoiler,"The whole movie is a massive magic trick and it deserves a second viewing just to comprehend the whole thing, which seems to be a constant thing regarding Nolan's movies.The movie is about two magicians (Bale and Jackman) who compete with each other as to who has the best trick, escalating to insanely extreme situations. Bale's biggest trick for example was that he had a twin brother and they swapped places the whole time! The twins went as far as cutting one's finger to match his twin brother. This was pretty awesome, especially if you know that real life magicians have gone to similar lengths. James Randy for example used to carry a piece of paper in his pocket for years. That piece of paper had ""today's"" date on it, saying that ""today I will die"". If he had a fatal accident, would you believe that he predicted his own death or that he wrote a piece of paper each day for years?! Talking about devotion! The movie explores that devotion and the sacrifices someone must do to deceive others. But the greatest deception of the movie was fooling the audience itself! The movie is very realistic but the explanation about the cloning machine was not something I could accept, so I looked around to see what other people thought about the ending. In my research pretty much everyone was agreeing with the explanation given, that Tesla gave Jackman a cloning machine, and Jackman in his every act kills one of his clones (or dies himself). That's pretty awesome and the audience bought it. But it's a lie nobody really saw! Michael Cain gives the secret 10 minutes before the end. Earlier he told a story about a sailor but he reveals now that the story was a lie. This is a hint that Jackman's story was also a lie, and Bale and the audience bought it.Cain tells the audience in the end that you don't want to know what happened, you want to be fooled. So what happened? Over the course of the movie, many bad things happen. Bale kills Jackman's wife and Jackman shoots Bale's fingers. Bale takes Johansson to his side, manipulates Root (Jackman's double) and humiliates Jackman on stage while braking his leg. Jackman kidnaps and buries Bale's friend to blackmail him for his secret. The secret was planned and Bale sends Jackman to a wild goose chase to America. There, Tesla fools Jackman with some hats and some cats to get away with the money.Jackman returns the favor by giving a fake diary to the imprisoned Bale. Everything regarding Tesla's machine, is only known from Jackman's diary. And knowing that Bale lied in his diary, then surely Jackman lied in his as well.So to wrap this up. Jackman was obsessed to find Bale's secret and it was only revealed to him in his last breath. The Tesla story was a lie and the machine never worked (that would be completely unrealistic, even for Tesla), but Jackman used it in his favor. Jackman used and killed Root to frame Bale. Bale dies, but his twin brother takes revenge by shooting Jackman.Almost perfect score because it fooled almost everyone!"
" Prestige Show
",,"Christopher Nolan brings yet another a mysterious movie to the big screen. We see all sorts of familiar faces this time around, but the audience is introduced to a few new characters as well.At Borden's murder trial, Angier's engineer John Cutter testifies how Borden pushed the water tank under the trap door to catch and kill Angier during his New Transported Man trick. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's daughter Jess in exchange for all of Borden's tricks. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which Borden reads. This film served as great entertainment with its colorful cast and numerous plot twists. The rivalry between Angier and Borden dominates the film. Obsession, secrecy, and sacrifice fuel the battle, as both magicians contribute their fair share to a deadly duel of one-upmanship, with disastrous results. Angier's obsession with beating Borden costs him a great deal of money and Cutter's friendship while providing him with a collection of his own suicide victims; Borden's obsession with maintaining the secrecy of his twin leads Sarah to question their relationship, eventually resulting in her suicide when she suspects the truth. True to Nolan's style, at 130 minutes, this film is lengthy. There were a few times when the movie felt a bit drawn out, but the gorgeous action scenes and impressive dialogue really held the audience's attention and kept them on the edge of their seats. However, the timeline was a bit unclear at times. For a number of scenes, it was hard to tell whether it had been days or months or years that had passed since the last time a given character had been on screen.The Prestige is sacrificing, non-humorous, and dark—and well worth a part of your time."
" The film works, it really does, even when it's less than artful
",,"Rewatching this makes it pretty clear what Nolan's primary focus is in storytelling (if it wasn't obvious before) - perspective and the subjective nature of it. What better way to expound on that than in a story about dueling magicians hiding their secrets from one another.There are metaphors galore in this (how could there not be in a film about subjectivity and obsession) but it struck me this time how convenient the story is. It moves constantly and forcefully forward, revealing twists all the way, daring you to try and outguess it, so at first it's easy to miss on the plot contrivances and somewhat simple nature of it all. But I'm also not sure how much that matters. The film works, it really does, even when it's less than artful."
" ""Are you watching closely?""
",spoiler,"This is a Christopher Nolan film, that's the first thing to notice here. But it's no Dark Knight or an Inception. It's a Magic movie. And... The film will play a bunch off tricks with your mind and way faster than you can say: ""Abracadebra!!""Rival magicians Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Borden (Christian Bale) have a long history of bad blood, beginning when Angier blamed Borden for the accidental death of his wife during a show. They part ways and Borden, with his illusion designer Fallon, creates a magic trick called ""The Transported Man,"" in which he enters one cabinet and exits another immediately after. With the help of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), Angier creates his own version of the trick with a mysterious machine.The story culminates with Borden finding a tank where Angier is drowning and being accused of Angier's murder. There are actually has two twists, one that is mundane and the other which is extraordinary, both based on the reveal of how the two men performed their separate tricks.On stage left, you have Christian Bale's ambitious magician, who reveals that he has pulled off all of his tricks over the years by actually being a pair of twins who have spent their lives acting as a single person. On stage right you have Hugh Jackman's self- destructive showman, who actually helps create a science fiction cloning device that allows him to pull off his illusions. It's two insane plot twists for the price of one, and you didn't see either coming.Angier's machine was actually a cloning device, and his clones were killed after each performance, drowned in a water tank. Borden's twist is simpler but more surprising: Like — he was actually identical twins, the two men each living half as Borden and half as the mysterious Fallon.A must see for everyone not just Nolan fans."
" Great acting and a twisty story about magicians from Christopher Nolan
",spoiler,"After the success of Batman Begins, Christopher Nolan took on magicians for his fourth original film. Two magicians, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) compete for the greatest illusion. The stage manager Cutter (Michael Caine) accuses Alfred of attempting to steal Angier's trick but murdering him instead and sends him to jail in the furthest forward storyline. The film operates on multiple story lines, one that follows Robert searching for the great inventor Tesla (David Bowie) and his assistant Alley (Andy Serkis) in Colorado, and another storyline that tells the history of Angier and Borden as young magicians. These stories come from diaries that the men read of each other. Alfred meets Sarah (Rebecca Hall) at a magic show and falls for her quickly. In the past, Borden tries a special knot that ends up killing Julia (Piper Perabo), Angier's lover. As Borden starts a solo career, Angier confronts him during a bullet catch trick and shoots his finger off. Having had his revenge, Angier reignites his career with a new name as the Great Danton and a new assistant Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). With the help of Cutter, he performs new tricks with special gadgets but Borden shows up to bust the birdcage and injure a participant. Desperate for a new trick and out of a show, Angier meets with Alley and finally is allowed to meet with Tesla in his hideout. This story parallels the real rivalry between Tesla and Edison over the conducting of electricity. Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com"
" Christopher Nolan's dark fantasy piece is smart, dazzling, but a little meandering
",,"The main purpose of magic is not to impress others nor to deceive them, but to simply give the illusion of something fake appear real for artistic purposes. That is lesson incorporated in this dark fantasy period piece starring Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as rival magicians in an intensifying battle to discover the truth of each other. Set with an intelligent, but convoluted plot and a visually alluring design of nineteenth century England, this movie sees director Christopher Nolan delivering his signature filmmaking tropes and bringing them together to form a dazzling mix of fantasy, suspense, and mystery elements in a story that like most of Nolan's works, drives with a fair amount of complexity and emotional twist; though suffers some occasional blemishes in the narrative department. Based on the novel by British author Christopher Priest, the film tells the story of Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Bordon (played by Christian Bale), two magicians who sustain a friendship as assistants for their town's magic shows run by master magician John Cutter (played by Michael Caine). But one night during a show, their performance goes terribly wrong that results in tragedy. The fateful event turns their duo's friendship into a bitter rivalry and soon leads to the two in an obsessive battle to discover each other's secrets. It's not long before their heated rivalry escalates into a downward spiral of deceit that threatens to not only tear apart their careers on stage, but their own personal beings. As this film deals with magic and sorcery, it should come to no surprise that Christopher Nolan brings a wide plethora of twists to the mix; and with a smoothly compelling script and striking visual resonance, Nolan appears to be at the top of his game. Wielding with spectacular directorial talent, Nolan drives this film with plenty of nuance and astounding visual potency. As the story revolves around a heated competition of revenge and deception that makes for some very dark and occasionally morbid moments, it pulls into a dark, eerie journey of Christopher Priest's novel with plenty of surprises supplemented by Nolan's stylish direction. Though the plot holds a fair amount of intelligence, the unnecessarily slow pacing does tend to kill the interest of the story. Instead of introducing the lead magicians at the beginning, the film proceeds through a non-linear narrative opening with Christian Bale's character Alfred on murder trail (for reasons you don't learn until later) which becomes intertwined throughout the story until the very end, before giving us the proper introduction on the characters. Along with this another subplot centering on famous inventor Nikola Tesla who's oddly played by singer David Bowie, trying to invent a teleporter. Nolan's use of non-linear storytelling not only overcomplicates the plot, but he doesn't execute in a way that is effective as what he achieved in 'Memento'. On the bright side, this director manages to keep things moving at least most of the time, and builds up the story up to a shocking, unpredictable conclusion. The performances by Christian Bale , fresh off of Nolan's 'Batman Begins', and Hugh Jackman both stand out; and the supporting cast including Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson as Robert Angier's assistant also make great appeal in their roles. While nothing particularly Oscar-worthy, these actors manage to fit the bill.The Prestige, though slightly inferior to Christoper Nolan's other works, is a smart, dazzling fantasy period piece with alluring energy of Nolan's directorial efforts and a fine array of charismatic performances by a likable cast. Though the level of complexity in the plot make the story a challenge for the most naive film goers to sit through, it also serves as a reminder of the fine cinematic talent Nolan never stops bringing to the screen."
" The Cats and The Hats
",spoiler,"***READ THIS ONLY IF YOU'VE SEEN THE FILM***When compared to the other magicians movie that came out the same time, The Illusionist, this movie is just slightly better. I saw a lot of the twists because they were hinted at throughout the movie. For instance, I figured that Borden had a twin or someone who looked like him because that's what Angier had. It wasn't until about 3/4 of the way into the movie that I started thinking about a twin brother. The twist about Angier's machine was pretty clearly put out there early on when you saw field with the Cats and the Hats. Why Tesla's assistant never saw the hats out there isn't really explained. You're just to assume that Angier made the discovery first. I'll have to re-watch the film, but as far as I could tell, it was Cutter who was setting up the tricks for Angier's final shows. At least, that's what it sounded like in the courtroom setting when he accused Borden/Fallon (we don't know who's really on trial) of moving the water tank under the trap door. But isn't it odd that nobody for all those performances never noticed the tank there every performance? Not even Cutter? Heck, even those blind assistants would have heard the thrashing about in the tank as the Angier originals were drowned. And that brings me up to the murder scene. How is it that every performance, Angier drowns his original, then appears on the balcony to the crowd, but then they don't show it when Borden discovers the secret?!! Shouldn't the clone have materialized on the balcony? Even if he did suspect Borden was dressed as one of the people inspecting the machine, he wouldn't have had time to recalibrate it to shoot his clone far away and out of sight. And lastly, why go through the trouble of getting a new tank full of water every day and storing it in a basement where people could find it? If Angier was dead, you'd think Cutter would have gone to that burned out theater, looked in the basement and saw all those tanks full of clones. I mean, they were supposedly selling off Angier's belongings. As for the bodies, it would have been more practical to just take the body out and dump it somewhere far away, instead of coming up with a new water tank for every performance. That place would have reeked after a couple of days. So the movie was great to watch and I was captivated by how the whole thing was unfolding just to see if what I was anticipating was true. Sadly, when you really think about all the twists and turns that are what supposedly made this film great, the whole thing just falls apart. Otherwise, I would have given it an 8/10. But I'm giving it a pass because of the great acting."
" OMG I want my 130 minutes back!!!!! EVERY NANOSECOND OF IT!!!!
",,"I can't seem to find a ""minus"" number on the review score, and believe me, I tried hard to find a way to get one for this profoundly overrated insult to the intellect and sensibilities. I see a lot of movies. I usually like movies that make me think. I usually like movies with plot twists. I usually like movies with suspense. Notice I did NOT say I usually like movies that make me THINK I want my time back, movies with more plot HOLES than the even astronomical amount of plot TWISTS, or movies that force me to SUSPEND disbelief light years beyond preposterous. That's not quite what I had in mind when I made my ultimately embarrassing decision to watch this movie, or worse yet, subject my wife to it as well. It's not enough to apologize to my wife...I apologize to all spouses everywhere, and I STILL don't feel cleansed. Oh. Did I mention that this waste of both the U.S. and British economies is unrelentingly and disturbingly dark? Hmmmm. Lemme think...which character did I care about LESS. Impossible to decide, because I COULDN'T have cared less. Ya know...wait a minute, that's not fair. It's not the ACTORS I didn't care about. It was the writers, director, and producer of this insult to humanity whose feelings I refuse to spare. How did this movie ever get conjured up??? The term ""Movie Magic"" is perfectly antithetical here, although The Prestige DOES succeed in getting your brain to disappear. The fact that this got an 8.5 rating on IMDb is either a parlor trick or a typo. At least I hope so, anyway. If not, I weep for the future, and will despondently have to dismiss all future ratings without exploring the ""Hated it"" reviews first. Honey, if you're reading this...I love you, I didn't mean to hurt you, and please forgive me. In fact, YOU get to pick the next one. Don't worry, darling, WHATEVER it is, it'll seem like The Godfather to me after this."
" What was this mess about?
",spoiler,"I honestly fail to understand what other reviewers saw in this mess of a movie. You get best actors, a lot of money, mix them up and get something totally indigestible. All these multiple clones - why???? I cannot shake off the impression that the whole movie is a magic trick like the one described by a character, only reversed: you are promised something extraordinary, instead of ordinary, you spend 2 hours waiting for it, and then - abracadabra, there is nothing in it. Big deal - a duplicating machine! And he uses it to create doubles! And kills them every night! So what?! The purpose of art is to tell us about ourselves, in however fancy clothes. There is nothing about human condition in this empty husk of a film."
" A mess of a movie, in my opinion.
",,"What comes to mind immediately in reviewing The Prestige, is a comparison to a similar, but far superior movie, The Illusionist. The Illusionist had it all: a great story with a complex but credible plot, great characters (especially Edward Norton as the Illusionist), and a thoroughly satisfying conclusion. The scenes of magic were extraordinary and creepy, transporting the viewer back to the world of a master conjuror's stage in the year 1900. By contrast, The Prestige had a silly, trivial plot that just kept repeating the schtick of two magicians who were rivals for no purpose, unimpressive ""tricks"" on the stage, and the preposterous Tesla device that duplicated everything like a surreal photocopy machine. The movie also took huge liberties, jumping around in time: one minute D'Anton was in London, and the next in Colorado, multiple times. Played fast and loose with parallel universes and time travel, I guess.I kept thinking, do I really care enough to watch the end of this movie? And why is Scarlett Johansen always typecast as a temptress/floozy? She looked like the early 20th century version of the character she played in Match Point, another loser of a movie."
" Actually I didn't like it much at all
",spoiler,"Spoilers... It did have some interesting aspects to the movie, but overall I was bored by their rivalry and such. Plus I disliked borden's character altogether. He obviously killed Angier's wife for whatever reason and yet he's the one who got married, and had a kid, so for me the wrong guy was shot... I hate movies that leave you with a bad taste in your mouth and this one certainly did for me. It seems stupid to me that Borden had a twin brother that nobody knew about. And even more retarded was this cloning machine idea. More or less it's a grudge match against two magicians, and not much more. Scarlett was beautiful as always, but what a bitch she played IMO. Oh well i guess this is why you can't always go by the ratings... Better luck next time I guess"
" Ending is worse than horrible
",,"THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAINE SPOILERS Slowly paced thriller, that comes apart at the seams because of very lazy writing.The filmmakers decided that the concept of being able to fool people a hundred years ago was not enough. They needed to create tricks that were so advanced and that relied on a science that is not even close to existing TODAY.The entire resolution of the movie relies on turning the main characters into super magicians. They can now do things that are quite simply just magic. This is thrown into a movie that is supposed to be about two guys obsessing on how good the other guy might be in their chosen profession.It is a lazy resolution to a high concept idea.It is quite possibly the worst ending to a top flight production in the last twenty years. Why do this? Why create a machine that cannot possibly exist? Why not have something clever or smart be the reason for how these guys can perform the seemingly impossible, but instead resort to abra kadabra thats just the way it is? There is no way to get over this gigantic plot point, that leaves anyone with half a brain watching this movie feel like they have been completely cheated."
" Disappointing
",,"Christopher Nolan's films are usually intelligently plotted and artistically well-made. ""The Prestige,"" unfortunately, is quite a letdown. This is no ""Memento""; it's not even a ""Batman Begins.""What sinks the film are its two big secrets (don't worry, I'm not going to reveal them here). One of the secrets is so scientifically ludicrous as to inspire laughter rather than awe. The other is so hoary and shopworn that one can only groan. Yes, the hackneyed secret is threaded into the film with cleverness and skill, but as the old saying goes, you can't polish a turd.The acting and direction are fine throughout, but the underlying plot weaknesses keep the film firmly anchored to mediocrity.6/10. A big disappointment."
" I felt conned...
",,"I mean you're supposed to feel conned that was the concept of the movie. What I felt conned by was the shoddy script/dialogue and 2D characters - must you become a drunk cliché when your lovers dies looking all mad eyed with the long hair and all??? Must you act 'ave a cuppa tea gvnor!' Scarlett?? I swear I heard you say 'like totally!' But most of all, what really made me mad what really insulted was the end twist! You mean to tell me you spent the whole movie working towards something that was so obvious!! We saw it half an hour during the movie, we guessed it in the relationships! We saw it written in the very in your face dramatic irony! We saw it as obvious as all my exclamation marks! There wasn't even an attempt at diversion. It was poor. The way the movie hid the twist was the the same way as Dick Dastardly plotted his evil doings.The fact that this movie has already gone into the top 250 shows that our audience can be fooled by anything. Get The Thin Red Line into the top 250 and then maybe, maybe I'll talk with some respect."
" Disappointing
",spoiler,"For movie that is in top 250, has such high rating and so much positive reviews it is really disappointing. It is really far from good movie and irritated me so much that I felt like writing my first ever review.First, start with good, or more precisely not so bad. Well, premise is good, and if this was done better maybe I would be interested in how they did tricks. And Tesla was very well done. Bowie was excellent choice for Tesla. Other than that I can't remember even single redeeming quality of this movie.Now, bad parts. Oh boy, where to begin.No likable characters. There isn't a single character in here that I can connect to or even like! And who is there to like? Angier who only wants to steal ""magic"" trick from Borden with no consideration for those around him? Borden(s) who has such bad attitude towards his wife and daughter? Mother who hangs herself out of jealousy and leaves her daughter alone? Olivia, who is so forgettable that she just dropped out from movie for no apparent reason and no one noticed? Nope, nope and nope... Rest of characters are so bland or appear so little that are not even worth of mentioning. Central plot should be rivalry between two illusionists. But their actions are so unrealistic and bland I had feeling like only thing pushing plot forward was will of the writer. And that is really bad storytelling.In a movie which presents itself like realistic we get such outrages deus-ex for main plot line it made me cringe. A machine that copies anything! A machine in 19th century which copies anything and can teleport! What? Really? Before this was introduced I still had some hope to rate this movie as watchable, but this just buried my hopes. Oh, and why there is no Sci-Fi category mark for this movie is beyond me.Scenes are jumping all over the place. One dude is reading diary of another dude, who at some point is reading diary of first dude, and all of that we get after opening scene that showed us main character die... Did I mentioned confusing time-line? Plot twists. Well, to be frank there is just one and that is revelation that Borden has a twin brother and that is how he does his Transportation trick. So greatest mystery, only thing in this movie worth anything, is revealed to be the simplest possible solution. Still, it wasn't that bad and there are hints to this. Problem is lack of other plot twists in what should be mystery driven movie.And why in the world Borden doesn't reveal his wife that he has a twin... Both twins slept with women they don't like and lied to family because of some stupid illusion trick? And cut fingers? And allow wife to hang herself because of this and leave his daughter motherless? Someone actually wants me to believe that? So when exactly they decided to act like one person? And how no one even noticed, his (their) wife never met ANY relative of Bordens who knew they were twins when they were little? So bad characters, bad plot, bad pacing, no point to the story, bad Sci-Fi elements... How can anyone, let alone so much people, give this movie good review is beyond me."
" Everyone can get a double ..that to identical !!
",spoiler,"This is my first Christopher Nolan movie and was curious to see his movie after so much buzz about his direction so We rented an DVD it was such a crap CD it took 5 hours and 2 systems plus four media planners and YouTube to watch climax, it was very tiring exercise because of crap CD still we took so much effort because we liked the movie!!This is the movie of two friends turned foes because of personal and professional reasons. Alfred Borden played by Christian Bale who is innovative, ready to work hard and take dangerous risks to come with breathtaking illusions and Robert Angier played by Hugh Jackman ,he is very good presenter who can enthrall audience with his presentation skills. They share complimentary skills. Unfortunately their complimentary skill doesn't make them partners but rivals. Difference begins when Julia played by Piper Perabo accidentally dies during performance and Borden doesn't clarify how he tied the knot during performance, so angier considers him responsible for his wife death. If there is such a fundamental difference between relationships it can only become worse. Then the rivalry begins between two to such an extent both appears on each other stage to destroy the performance one another.Finally Borden performs an ultimate illusion which wasn't done by any one before THE TRANSPORTED MAN, Which puts Angier into great obsession to do the same or perform something better than this or steal it from him and perform it through his excellent presentation skills. He does same illusion with the help of cutter (Michael Caine) his guru and his double. But not satisfied doing with double and thinks Borden is doing alone wants to know the trick and decides to send his assistant Olivia played by Scarlett Johansson to steal the trick from Bordan but she feels betrayed as she was in love with him and instead stealing the trick for Angier she decides to join Borden and take revenge against angier and reveals the trick angier is doing it do in his version transported man ,so Borden approaches angier double and convinces threats he can come across by being an double and woos him to his side and during much hyped and much awaited performance of Angier, Bordan appears in the place of Angier double and destroys the show, this puts angier in deep humiliation and deeply disturbed and decides to come up with an illusion which answer Bordan then he approaches Olivia to know why she betrayed him and manages to take dairy of Bordan against her will and takes his journey to places meets Tesla to come up with illusion never done before. Tesla is a scientist who was working on some next generation electricity machine and Angier decides to invest in the project which could help him in his illusion. So far it is good Then it become sillier and sillierFinally Tesla delivers it but has to runaway because was under attack by Einstein men. What the machine does, It emits electricity from different direction which looks like thunder, anyone who stands in it and receives electricity it will produce a double nearby place. This is so silly I don't need to tell who silly it is. He takes the machine even thou Tesla advices him to be very careful with it. Finally he realizes he has got what he was looking for. He decides to perform it in best theater in town and to large number of audience so he approaches his guru cutter to arrange for such a show and manage from front. Show was super successful and does one hundred such shows which finally move Bordan to watch his show and find out the trick behind it. Once Angier is performing the show and gets inside the floor Bordan moves towards the show to check it. Angier falls into water tank and starts feeling suffocating and locks gets closed he can't come out, Bordan takes an iron rod and starts hitting the glass to save him but wasn't successful and Bordan is taken to custody for killing him and sentenced to death and he will orphaning his daughter. Angier appears back to tell Bordan he is better than him. Bordan was shocked and surprised at this but he is helpless now. He is hanged then Angier decides to abandon his machine as it has served its purpose. He is standing near his machine being proud of his victory. He is shot by Bordan now it's time for Angier to shocked and surprised looking at Borden. Finally Borden reveals his trick of transported man He simply used double. His double loved Julia and his wife died because she thought he wasn't honest with her and he could not reveal his secret because of him. This comes as deep shock for Angier and dies. This came as deep shock for me also how come both find a double that identical and perform what they ask. This is story put in a straightforward way but Nolan has done an outstanding job I don't know what the industry word is for it I would refer it frame twisting how he has done it is better watched but I really like his approach. Even though some looks funny overall movie was good performance by all roles are fantastic. It is well paced and explains very well what really happens in magic behind the scenes that what made movie interesting for me.Finally,I would definitely like to see all his movies."
" Obsession, jealousy, and deceit define the tense relationship shared between two turn-of-the-century magicians.
",,"Christopher Nolan directed seven films so far, and The Prestige is his worst one. It's not necessarily bad though. The Prestige is typical Nolan filmmaking. There are no notable performances even though the cast consists of some of the most famous actors working today. Only David Bowie and Hugh Jackman make somewhat of an impression. The film is heavy-going and long. Nolan continues to aim for the noir look, but he can't capture it well in his film projects. So the film ends up being too dark and somber for its own good. The ending is meant to be clever, but with Nolan's direction it doesn't feel that way. Still, it's a solid release overall. There's nothing to distinguish it, however. Like all other films by Nolan it's overrated. He is not a great filmmaker. This is a man who's been influenced by Ridley Scott and the Wachowski brothers. He rarely comes up with anything original, and just continues to copy them. I don't recommend watching The Prestige. The magic tricks here are nothing to get excited about. Nolan erroneously aims for realism, but this approach leaves a bad taste in the mouth. This is far from being anywhere near Steven Spielberg's genius."
" This is a really good movie!
",spoiler,"This movie was so good that I bought the DVD and that's something I don't do very often unless that movie has caught my attention, well it did. It was very well plotted and I loved how Jackman and Bale(in the movie) showed their rivalry, it was really believable. My favorite part was when Robert does this amazing trick that is really hard to explain unless you've seen the movie. But, they used a person that looks just like him(even though it was really him)I expected it to be kind of boring but it didn't bore me one bit. I was interested in the movie from the beginning. If you haven't watched this movie already,I suggest you find a way and see because you will not regret watching it. I jope that Hugh Jackman and Chris Bale could work together and make another movie because this one was phenomenal! I give it a 10/10! Great Movie!"
" This movie was AMAZING!
",spoiler,"The Prestige. Where do we begin? Let's name all the good things about this movie: Chirstopher Nolan, Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, the plot. Despite allegedly being nothing like the book The Prestige, Nolan directed a spectacular film. Part of it was how Nolan put the scenes all out of order, yet you lost no sense of what took place in what order. In addition, the scenes were in just the order to make you say, ""Wow, that makes total sense now!"" at the end of the movie. For instance, the movie opens with a shot that you don't think about until many scenes later at which point you go exclaim the aforementioned exclamation. Bale, Jackman, and Caine did stellar performances in The Prestige. Bale masterfully played Alfred Borden, the great magician couldn't book a decent theater, or make his tricks look good. Jackman was incredible as Robert Angier, the not-as-good, yet obsessed magician who could make his tricks look like something unbelievable. Michael Caine, also did amazing as the illusion engineer who was the source of most of Angier's tricks. The Prestige's plot was full of twists, turns, and parts that made made you say ""Woah."" Upon re-watching the movie, one notices that the script is riddled with hints that reveal the end. The plot contains a bitter rivalry, revenge, and things you have to notice to figure it out before the movie ends. Once the ending is revealed, the audience's jaw drops when the end is not what it seems. The cover to the DVD says ""You want to see it again the second its over."" That's probably the best way to put it. The first time you watch it , you're not really looking for how the story comes together, you want to be shocked. 10 stars. This movie was awesome."
" Great, epic film
",,"This movie is an absolute masterpiece of epic proportions. Director Nolan gives us one of his best directing jobs. This movie contains everything from romance to pity, and power to poverty. Both Jackman and Bale play amazing characters. Bale is power hungry individual who stops at nothing short of owning and controlling everything in the world. This movie portrays the feelings and emotions of guilt and punishment. What is a great story and gripping account of what happens when dreams turn into nightmares.This is so much better than 'The Illusionist'I also love the lack of profanity."
" we turn the dice,the movies turns the table..........
",,"i start by giving it ..nothing less than 10 ......it deserves it ...anyway this movies is scripted beautifully,has a sense of mystery and clever too because it has to cover many sub plots also,and the writer is ..more than successful in achieving it.The dialogs and the cinematography of the scenes with long shots is fabulous in all senses.The story takes away the show by some extraordinary twists and turns and a strange flow of its own kind.And apart form the huge twists one after another,they are stated in such manner that people can also believe them at the time they come crashing there brains....!!Coming from one of the best directors today ..The Prestige is indeed prestigious,and by far one of the greats of all time ..and deserves a place at least higher to No Country For Old Men..in the 250 chart.At last i recommend it strongly to....own a DVD of this movie...if you like content full films of any kind ........you will not be disappointed at all.....sit back...and let the magic fascinate you ....... and you will leave with long lasting effects ..of disbelieve and pleasure ..........hats off or this one ...."
" Intelligent and incredibly suspenseful
",,Drama about two magicians in England in the 1800s--Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). They perform together and Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) is accidentally killed during an act--or maybe not. Angier blames Borden--Borden denies it. They then start competing acts and try to sabotage each other--and things get deadlier and the stakes higher.This was a box office bomb and that's a shame. It is a little too long and it keeps you guessing--that's why people probably stayed away. This isn't a movie you can relax with--you have to pay strict attention to figure out what's going on. The movie has many ingenious twists and turns and constantly keeps pulling the rug out from under you. You always think you know where it's going--but then it veers off completely in another direction. Some people hate challenging films like this but I was fascinated. The acting is just superb across the board. Jackman and Bale have never been better--they come tearing out of the movie at you. Even the supporting roles are well done. Michael Caine (playing sort of a Greek chorus) pops up and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson are also very strong. And wait till you see David Bowie as Tesla! Also the direction by Christopher Nolan just adds to the film immensely. He was one of the co-writers so he knows what he wants.Ingenious drama--beautifully acted and directed and full of twists and turns. One of the best movies of 2006. A definite must-see!
" Superb exploration of its subject matter
",,"I've just watched The Prestige and thoroughly enjoyed it.I've always had a fascination for stage and street magic - not so much to ""figure out the tricks"", but with an appreciation of the combination, of stagecraft, misdirection, and sleight of hand. The great magicians aren't remembered for ""clever tricks"" - rather, for the overall entertainment, for the illusion.And this film is perfect for all that. There is a mystery to it (in fact, at least two mysteries), but the clues to each are telegraphed all throughout the film, in plain sight. You have to watch and be alert.I figured out one of the mysteries in the middle of the film, but was still fascinated by how it was done. I think this is the same thrill I get when I'm watching a film about con artists (or a good episode of the old Mission Impossible), because what is shown is not always what is.And as this film explains, it's not how such things are done that matters (because once it's explained, no one cares any more), rather, it's that creation of illusion so that we have ""mystery"", that does."
" Unforgivable (Spoiler Alert!!)
",spoiler,"I generally enjoyed this movie a great deal, even though I failed to find a main character that I even remotely admired. However, the main storyline of conflict and endless scheming did hold my attention. The performances were generally convincing, even tho a few of the accents were far less then authentic.However, the contrivance of an ending that relies on a Sci-Fi device very akin to something from ""Star Trek"" made me walk away from the movie greatly disappointed. What a horribly cheap trick to have as the movie's ""big twist"" especially when the rest of the movie purported to be firmly based in solid reality. Tricks that backfired resulted in drowning or blown off fingers, ropes grew swollen when wet and became too difficult to untie, and trapdoors dropped magicians onto hard piles of sacking in the small dark recesses below the stage.The ending of the movie has to rely on a ""cloning"" machine to work. Was it amazing and clever? No, it was completely and utterly cheap and disappointing. I saw it coming very early on, but had convinced myself that the director would never stoop so low. I was wrong.Enough said. I found this an above average movie, entertaining on many levels, which, because of a ""beam-me-up-Scottie"" ending, left a bad taste in my mouth."
" Abracadabra!
",spoiler,"What a fantastic, suspenseful, exciting film! This movie kept you on the edge of your sit the entire time. It made you ask yourself questions and second guess yourself. You can't just watch this movie once. You have to watch it again and again to figure out who is who, what they're doing, and why they're doing it. The tag-line on the front cover of the DVD pins it perfectly: ""You want to see it again the second it's over!"" I think I've finally got everything figured out now that I've watched it about five times. You learn something new that you missed or didn't see every time you watched it before. But that's why it's so great! Christian Bale is one of my favorite actors and he was phenomenal as the mysterious Alfred Borden. His was the most versatile and dynamic role and he truly made the movie a success. I liked him more as the real Alfred Borden, the one who loved Sarah, rather than his ""twin."" It was just so amazing how he was able to play both different versions of himself simultaneously. Christian Bale is a very talented actor- one of the best. You also see the dark side of Hugh Jackman and honestly I really didn't like his character much. He really lost sight of what was important and just went too far. In the end he was a completely different person, evil almost. The movie had a fair but just ending. And I thought Rebecca Hall also deserves an honorable mention for her small role in the film as Borden's wife. She played a key role in helping to determine exactly which ""Alfred Borden"" it was on screen at the time and I thought it was very unique how they did that. All in all, this movie was genius- magical even!"
" To Live the Third Act
",,"""The Prestige"" will keep you guessing what's coming next. It's one of those movies you just want to know the answer straight away but still beg for more clues. It's exciting, twisted, smart and well written. See it.In the world of illusion, Borden and Angier will become enemies after one of their tricks goes incredibly wrong. Their rivalry will go past any limit, reaching further to accomplish the best trick and reveal all of their enemy's secret. Thanks to Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman, the basic duel that is drawn throughout the film is stunningly acted and enigmatic, with classy gestures and smooth performance of dialogs. Christopher Nolan revives the era with delicious decorations and use of dampened tones, which gives the film an intense and pushy aura. The rivals are primarily interested in the ""living"" on the act, where the best trick is to deceive the audience into inflicting doubts to them and carrying them away from the truth.Michael's Caine character (who does a great role also) states that the magic is formed by three parts: the turn, which presents ordinary things to attract the audience, the pledge to transform this into something extraordinary and the prestige; the most important act, to blow them away.It's end is clever and has many levels to understand it. It will all fall as a puzzle. The film, as it should, shields a fantastic Prestige. A turn of the table that will leave you gasping and clapping.Watch it, it's a nice puzzle to watch being solved. Just let the magic flow."
" Pure genius!
",,"At one point in the film, Hugh Jackman's character says ""That was the greatest magic trick I've ever seen."" I walked out of the theater thinking the same goddamn thing! This whole movie is just one big trick that the filmmakers have pulled on you, and by the time it's over, you'll realize that you just spent a couple bucks on a huge, two-hour magic trick. This may be my favorite movie ever. Just when you think you know what's going on, something else happens! It is very, very complicated stuff. There are flashbacks upon flashbacks, and it may be a little difficult to follow. Acting a key element in this film, and it's mostly great. Christian Bale carries it all on his shoulders, as he truly is the ""Prestige"" to the film's great rick, which I will not reveal. Hugh Jackman is good as the magician who grows mad with power, but Bale far surpasses him. Michael Caine is as memorable as always, but he's essentially playing a harsher version of the character he played in ""Batman Begins"". One of the best performances comes from Rebecca Hall as Bale's wife, who becomes confused and depressed after he loses his former glory. Scarlett Johannson isn't really offered much to work with but she does have a few memorable moments. The films final twists and turns will leave you so shocked that you realize everything you were going to say you hated about the movie, you now love. See this magic trick. It's very dark and depressing stuff, but you know that you want to be fooled."
" The most fascinating film that I have ever seen in recent times...
",spoiler,"It has been long time I haven't given ten points for a film. ""The prestige"" deserves all praise sentences.The pledge, the turn and the prestige. The facts that shaped around these concepts are the base of two passionate illusionist's rivalry. But they are more interested in the last stage of illusion that is the prestige. Because it is important that the illusion happened or not, there is no importance for the shape of happening. Two capable illusionist are aware of this reality and devote themselves to beat each other. One of them is Alfred Borden and the other is Robert Angier.To the story that based on a novel, Alfred Borden and Robert Angier starts to work in Cutter's shows. During an illusion Borden causes Angier's wife to die. After this tragic dead, Borden separates his way Cutter and Angier continues with him. Whatever Angier does, Borden's illusions arouse interest between people even if Angier travels to America for the technological support of Nikola Tesla. At last, a machine that Tesla invented is useful for the show of Angier. It is supposed Angier to die by the effort of Borden and Borden goes to jail and waits for the execution day. In fact, Angier doesn't die and Borden doesn't go to jail. The person that jailed and waiting for execution as Borden is his assistant and also dubber. In addition, the person who died during the Angier's last illusion is his clon who produced by the mysterious machine. But no one knows that amazing fact.As I said above, Angier and Borden race for the number one in illusion world and they lose their family for the sake of this purpose. Angier works to gain new numbers owing to machines that Tesla made and Borden works to keep his secrets from Angier. In fact, his secrets aren't so mysterious as Angier supposes. His secrets are very easy and arise from a loyal man like his assistant Fallon. He is so loyal to lose his fingers and go dead instead of Borden.The last things I'll say about the story will be like that. As an electrical engineer, I think there is many injustices about Nikola Tesla in the film. For example, Tesla is pointed out as a man who finance his works owing to such special machine demands. However, his financiers was today's big companies to invent new things about the new forms of electricity. Of course Tesla was a genius,but I think he had never run after such fantastic things. He devoted himself to find out brilliant inventions that will be really useful for the humanity.Let me come to technical details about the film. The story is unusual and mentally worked on it. Besides I want to celebrate the director by the methods that he used. Twists and turns got me amazed many times. Borden's and Angier's daily came to the screen by dividing the story skillfully.Hugh Jackman's performance as Angier is wonderful. Especially Christian Bale charmed me like in his role of Borden. A person could become identifical with his role merely as he did. Scarlett Johansson shows that she is the woman of attractive roles again. The sounds, effects and dialogs are so harmonious with it.The film also gives ideas about the fine points of illusion art. If you haven't watched a remarkable film in recent times, surely watch it.PS : If you didn't understand the film exactly for the first time like me, you may be bored for the second trial."
" absolute class
",,"the prestige is the one of the best Hollywood movie i have seen.t2 and rocky balboa were my previous favorites. This movie is a pure masterpiece.It has the best screenplay and individual performances. Chris bale continues to impress again....Chris Nolan is such a amazing director,i cant see anyone else directing this movie to such perfection...This film cant be remade anywhere else... One who did not get he hang of the movie the first time,has to see it again...you will be amazed.. I cant imagine how much time it took to write this magnificent script,its just top notch..This movie is way better than departed or some other 2006 movie,it should have got an Oscar 100/100.."
" Never ask me about my business.
",spoiler,"Dark, brooding piece about the rivalry between two turn-of-the century stage illusionists outdoing each other. One of the young men, Borden (Christian Bale) may have been responsible for the death of the other's beloved blond wife, the other being Angier (Hugh Jackman). Angier and his mentor, Michael Caine, continue their careers, while Borden builds his own.The emotional tumult caused by the death of Angier's wife leads him to sabotage Borden's performance, actually shooting two of his fingers off. Borden, filled with resentment, retaliates by putting a major crimp into Angier's career. It gets a little complicated but they both wind up more or less at the top of the prestidigitative heap before the end.There are romances flung into the pot too, functional to the extent that they illustrate character development in the two magicians and act as links between the two competitors. Scarlette Johansson is surprisingly good as the bosomy stage assistant with the working-class Brit accent, even though the dialect suppresses her usual croak. Rebecca Hall is splendid as the perceptive woman who takes up with the lower-class Borden, even though she knows he's lying half the time when he tells her he loves her. (He's married to his job, you see.) Enter Nicolas Tesla, the very real historical figure who did all sorts of things, conceptual and physical, that strike some of us as a little outré today. A man ahead of his time, played by an unrecognizable David Bowie.At this point, what was a more or less cogent drama turns into something else. Tesla, like Baron Frankenstein, pulls off something that's half scientific and half supernatural. If you've seen ""The Fly"" you have some idea, only the idea you have is a little simpler than the one presented here. I was a little confused by the ending in which ""all is explained"" but somewhat too perfunctorily for me. Maybe I'm dull but the jigsaw puzzle remained mostly a table full of scattered and disjointed pieces.The photography captures the time and place nicely. Too nicely, maybe, because it's hard to imagine anyone wanting to live in a landscape of perpetual poverty and gloom. If there was a scene in bright daylight, I missed it. Do we learn anything about the tricks of stage magicians? Are you kidding? Illusionists have the kinds of social borders (us inside, them outside) that cops have, or airline pilots or doctors. The trick is told when the trick is sold. We do see some of the machinations but they're ones we might have easily figured out for ourselves. The ultimate trick, the one devised by Tesla, is of course never explained because it never happened.I hope you don't find these comments confusing. If you do, the film will present an even greater challenge. Still, it's worth watching for anyone with mature sensibilities. Confusing, maybe. Pandering, no."
" Surprising and thought-provoking
",,"It's a long time since I saw a film where I was so hooked on the story. The Prestige has a plot so full of twists and turns it merits several viewings - and even then there will be arguments over who did what - but I can honestly say that it is so engrossing that I enjoyed every minute of it again and again. What I really admire is the way everything - every word spoken, every action - was linked throughout the story. Nothing is wasted.I have seen the film criticised for being too cold and calculating. Maybe some of the characters come across in this way, but this isn't a film that wears it's heart on it's sleeve. It's not a romance. I think it goes deeper than that and asks questions about life and what we think are prepared to sacrifice."
" Tesla - Have you watched him closely?
",,"The film is brilliant, but its brilliance is also it's greatest downfall. It's a film for the awakened, but a sleeping pill for the already sleepy. To appreciate the film is to already be aware of certain facts, or to have faith in certain schools of thought, primarily the possibility of time travel. Tesla was a genius. A scientific prophet maybe. He claimed that concepts for many of his inventions simply appeared to him in his mind's eye or in a dream. A long explanation of Tesla's life could be made by somebody with sufficient knowledge, which I don't have. But I do have faith - that he was a man who knew things that have changed and will continue to change the world and the way that we think. The film is a truth puzzle. To understand the film, is to understand that there are concepts and ideas that have been repressed from us, to be free from the fear of uncertainty, and to embrace the vast pool of possibility and discovery that is humanity's gift. The film addresses the two polar characteristics of man - his ability to be logical, and his ability to be emotional - and merges them into a mutually exclusive relationship. That is, one cannot exist without the other. For those who are at odds with the film - the prestige of our lives is the discovery of truth, and I encourage those who wish to understand it's message. Hell, it's worth it. I love this film, and the passion put into it by the actors and other artists. It defines the age we live in, and is an elaborate and magnificent portrait of our collective soul in this modern age."
" Abracadabra.
",,"The Prestige sees two rivaling magicians, Borden and Angier, in an intensive battle of wits that goes so far that their lives at stake. The two are portrayed by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman who deliver powerful performances, supported by an excellent cast of Michael Caine, Andy Serkis and, guess who, yep, David Bowie.Director Chris Nolan again shows his trademark by going back and forth the storyline as the film progresses, much as he's done with the critically-acclaimed Memento and Batman Begins, which, through his skillful execution, is used to tremendous effect. With involvement from his brother, Jonathan Nolan, the duo are able to recreate the suspense and complexity as shown in Memento, intriguing the audience as they are brought deeper and deeper into the story.This is story-telling at its finest. With a tremendous twist ending that ties up the knots neatly but also leaves out some tiny loose ends, the movie is satisfying but will make you sit through the credits, thinking you might have missed something..."
" good, but slightly over-rated
",,"By now we know that the unexpected would be for Christopher Nolan to make an expected film. Yet, 'The Prestige' is to some extend the most expected film of Nolan until now. It is an adaptation of a novel about the rivalry between two magicians turned into a life long obsessive fight, and although we do find interesting issues like the relationship between perception and reality and the border between life and illusion for an artist, the overall script is too much conventional in structure. The most disappointing is the ending, sure, we get an explanation for much of what we have seen, and the explanation makes sense, but then the magic is gone. You do not explain magic and expect for magic to stay.On the good side we have a strong hate story, which stays in the memory on the memorable stories of rivalry brought to screen, in the line of the 'Count of Monte Christo'. The script is well written, with some memorable lines. We also have Michael Caine whose every new act seems now to radiate personal charisma and the joy to be with us and act for us. Please Mr. Caine, stay with us and act for us forever.On the less good side I will put the acting in the two principal roles. Contrary to the majority of the opinions I do not believe that either Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale did a memorable job here. I mean they were OK, but the roles offered much better opportunities. Scarlett Johansson is undercast here, she deserves much more interesting roles. Cinematography and sets seem to be a little bit uninspired. Yet, the greater disappointment is that there is too little magic left when the film ends."
" What a movie, EXCELLENT ¡¡¡
",,"What a movie, it's really one of the best movies i have ever watched. It took to me about 5 hours to finished it, i reversed it many times to try to understand. It deserve an Oscar, there's no more, I LOVE ""THE PRESTIGE"". It is very helpful to get comments of many people who likes movies, I watched it around 3 weeks ago and i have not finished to understand all points, there is a lot of magic. After I red several comments i will watch again, I really want to watch again, maybe this time i will be able to discover all secrets. Thanks to Nolan's for this movie, it makes feel that ""good movies"" does not finish yet.I am from Mexico, regards"
" It absolutely blew my mind.
",,"The trailers for The Prestige carefully concealed it as a light-hearted film about a magician- nothing more, nothing less.I did not expect the dark, deep, and involving film that played out after I popped in my DVD.The opening lines, narrated by Michael Caine who plays the patron magician ""Cutter"", are a big key to understanding the movie. Cutter explains that there are three important parts to a magic trick- the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Throughout the movie you will see how this law applies, as the ""secrets"" to some of the tricks are revealed.The second part of the beginning of the movie follows. We see Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) trapped in a water-filled glass tank below stage, struggling to get out. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) goes underneath the stage and discovers him there. The movie then skips ahead to a trial, in which Alfred Borden is being charged for the murder of Robert Angier- he evidently drowned to death in the tank. Alfred Borden is found guilty of murder and sentenced to die.A rich lord sends a messenger stating that he will take care of Borden's young daughter in exchange for the secret to Borden's greatest trick. The messenger is also sent to give Borden Angier's diary.That, is how our story really begins. We see through the point of view of Robert Angier as Borden reads through the diary.Robert Angier and Alfred Borden worked together underneath Cutter, until a tragic accident caused them to go their separate ways. Some time after they separated, Alfred Borden released an amazing trick. Angier, consumed with jealousy, did everything inside his power to find the secret to the trick. In fact, he began to doubt that it was a trick at all, but rather ""true magic. He was in constant competition with Borden, always trying to outdo him as a magician.Hugh Jackman does an excellent job in portraying Angier's passions, delusions, and melancholy. He completely blew me away with its vibrant showing of his true talent in this movie. After seeing the X-men films, I was almost certain that he was trapped as Wolverine, but when you watch this movie you will think absolutely nothing of Wolverine and absolutely everything of Robert Angier.Christian Bale, as always, was also excellent. I have not seen an actor so diverse, so adept at playing a variety of completely different roles in as long since perhaps Johnny Depp. Yet Christian Bale even outshines Johnny in that department. You will be reminded as little of him as Batman as you will of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. He truly put on the character and he put him on with brilliance.The entire movie is a mystery up to the very end. We do not know if perhaps the rivalry did get out of control and Borden murdered Angier, or if Borden's magic is real and not just another clever illusion. What I can tell you, however, is that the conclusion will shock you, and you will be talking about, and thinking about the movie for long after the credits roll."
" The Prestige
",spoiler,"The Joe Cool Experience: The Prestige(2006)Starring: Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier Christian Bale as Alfred Borden Michael Caine as Cutter Scarlett Johansson as Olivia Wenscombe David Bowie as Nikolas TeslaPlot: Two rival magicians try to one-up each other, especially when it comes to a certain trick called ""The Transported Man"", which eventually leads to them embarrassing, attacking and trying to murder one another.Openers: I had been looking forward to this movie for a while. I liked the cast, I liked the director, and the plot sounded very interesting. In an era with remakes and sequels, it's nice to see an original movie step up and show everyone how's it done. And this was original. Did it live up to my expectations?The Good: The acting is wonderful. I've always been a Christian Bale fan, ever since he went insane in American Psycho. He just seems like one of those actors that gives 100% into everything he does and that makes every performance memorable. This one is no exception. He plays a likable character with a bit of a dark side and does it flawlessly. Hugh Jackman, who I haven't actually seen do too much acting(considering I've seen nothing but X-men and Van Helsing) does well as Bale's rival. It's a good performance when I'm able to say ""That's Angier"" as opposed to ""What's Wolverine doing in this movie?"". Both of the main actors put forth an engaging show. Michael Caine is, as always, the glue that holds this thing together. Even though he is in a supporting role he does excellently and helps everything move along. This movie also has many twists and turns, which helps a lot.The Bad: I did not like the fact that in the end, the movie almost literally holds your hand and explains everything to you. It's like since Nolan felt he was releasing a bigger picture that wasn't a Batman movie, he had to explain it for audiences. I didn't like it at all. Let the audience figure it out for themselves. It takes a bit to explain every little thing and by the time they do and all the twists are revealed, I was left kind of drained. It just took me out of the movie experience.The Ugly: David Bowie. Who told this man he could act? His presence threw me off.Final Verdict: The Prestige is right up there in the top films for the year. Great performances and a great story, plus awesome effects. High recommendation from me.Rating: ****1/2 of *****"
" Clever,maybe a bit too clever..
",,"This was a movie that I had heard many good things about and I was looking forward to watching it. Did it live up to my expectations? If I am honest, I was slightly disappointed.The movie is stylish and very well filmed and the acting is also mostly fine. Of the two leads, Hugh Jackman is definitely better and gives probably the best performance in the movie. On reflection, Christian Bale isn't that great and his accent really seems put on and not natural. Michael Caine is fine and Scarlett Johansson is mostly OK, though she doesn't always convince. There is also a nice little cameo from David Bowie. The effects are clever and the actual story is pretty good. So why wasn't I more blown away with this film? I think that the movie relies a great deal on the twist or twists and I could kind of see them coming a mile off and this certainly diminished some of the impact. I also felt that the movie was trying too be just a little too clever at the end, trying to fit in too many twists.I didn't get ALL of them but certainly the most important ones. Obviously,I won't even hint at the outcome and it is fun trying to work out the story before it reaches it's conclusion.This is a movie worth watching but it may not live up to your expectations."
" Enjoyable but ultimately silly -- disappointing ending
",spoiler,"There are some fine performances in this movie, especially those by David Bowie and Michael Caine. It has a good plot (somewhat spoiled by the confusing flashback-within-a-flashback direction) and some good character studies. But the whole house of cards falls down when the story introduces the ludicrous notion that Tesla invented a machine that could replicate an entire human being -- including clothes and memories? Apart from the fact that it's unbelievable, it causes two problems in the narrative. First, it introduces a deus ex machina, which the Subtle Fiction Writers' Workshop defines as a no-no. Worse, it changes the entire milieu of the movie in mid-stream. Up to that point, we are in the realm of Victorian magic -- no matter what appears to have happened, everything is governed by physical laws. Rather than find a good way for Angier to best Borden, the writers use the cheap narrative trick of allowing Angier to simply step outside the laws of physics.Since the ending of the film depends on rather clumsy narrative sleight-of-hand, it's hard to swallow...and thus hard to rate this movie as great, instead of just good."
" *******WOW****** Best I've seen in awhile!
",,"Those reviewers who give The Prestige low marks don't appreciate Christopher Nolan's talents and couldn't keep up mentally with the movie's direction. Christopher Nolan is indeed the best director in the mystery genre and creating wonderful plot twists with deep character development. The Prestige will keep you guessing from beginning towards the end. About 99.9% of movies that I watch, I guess at every turn what will happen but this movie will kept me wondering until the end... The acting is superb as Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are pitted against each other as rival magicians. I'm unable to see any other actors other than Bale and Jackman in the characters they played. Excellent casting with the rest of the supporting actors; Michael Caine, Scarlett, Bowie....Must see!"
" Magic behind the magic
",,"A great film!, 7 well earned stars for this movie; this is a little below the user's ranking, but in my personal standards is very high. I recommend deeply this movie; the way that you get involved with the tricks and the engineering behind some great magic shows makes you almost feel like a magician too; all the scenarios and cinematography is captivating, and the story keeps you at every single moment deeply involved with the film. Please watch the film and feel the magic behind the magic, the acting roles are performed excellent, the intensity of Angier and Borden is tense and captivating, and the involvement of Cutter with the tricks is great too, a magical film behind the magical tricks of the 19th century entertaining industry."
" Nothing is Impossible, But  Are You Watching Closely? :-)
",spoiler,"I haven't liked a movie so much for some time now; talking about magic, there is no way to it could possibly address to you like an ordinary realistic movie, though it does not appeal to the tricks of SF. The movie comes forth straight with a genuine magical reality, with an invisible curtain raised little by little, it takes your breath away by the immense number of ""tricks"", by the action in present time ""magically"" blended with scenes read from two diaries, and by the changes of supremacy between the two main characters - two apprentices who are friends at first, becoming then fierce enemies (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman). The two heroes are somehow alike: they are in fact driven by the desire to become the best magician, thus changing the initial rivalry into a ""fight for your life"" war, which makes each of them cause the other sentimental and physical losses.The first one emotionally hurt (maybe by accident?), is chasing the other - first for revenge, then for finding out the secret of the successful trick involving the queen of the tricks - teleportation; a truthful, imaginative and extremely wise engineer (Michael Caine), gifted at finding magic devices based on recent inventions in the scientific world and responsible for the ""making of"" the tricks is the ""raisonneur"" of the movie; a secret machine, which you can't help waiting for intensely, built by a famous physicist, Tesla, in a land which seems to be another world (even if it is ""electrically"" developed, for the needs of the scientist) also has an important part to play. The women in the movie, be they gentle wives or skilled charming assistants (like Scarlett Johansson) do not enjoy happiness, as the two leading characters are too deep into the obsession for each other.But trust me on this: the ""magic"" of the movie, the charm of the characters and the turns of the plot may not be described, only experienced - so I invite you to see this movie as ""The Prestige""- meaning the third part of a magic trick- by the director, Christopher Nolan.PS - The music is just WONDERFUL!"
" A wonderful flick filled with tricks
",,"It's always nice to see a director-actor duo collaborate in successive projects, especially when they can be removed from the massive studio work situation that surrounds a film like Batman Begins, which is where we find Nolan and Bale, filling in time between Bat films. A subsequent pairing allows the director and actor to further their relationship and speak in a kind of shorthand, bringing their collaboration to new heights. Think of Scorcese-DeNiro and Scorcese-DiCaprio, or Spike Lee-Denzel Washington for examples of this.The term relationship is key, as The Prestige centers around the relationships the characters have with each other and what is perceived as their connective tissue plays both within and beyond the film. The audience is placed in a very strategic position of both knower and seeker of knowledge, and like a good magic trick, it is what we perceive and expect that will equally guide us and trick us towards the final act, or what is referred to in magic circles, as ""The Prestige"".Nolan's previous work (Memento, Following, Insomnia) has built upon his manipulation of audience engagement with film texts, and tweaking our sophisticated knowledge as viewers in such a way that our work as an audience helps propel the film as we are forced to guess, then second guess our preconceived notions of where his films are headed. Without recognizing our intelligence as an audience, the film would have no place to go.The psychology of Nolan's films are like that of a masterful storyteller, akin to Robertson Davies' Fifth Business set of novels. The make up and structure of the medium, whether it is writing or film-making, or magic tricks, is key to the enjoyment of the medium's content. We are well aware as we watch The Prestige, how the film unfolds in three acts, exactly as the magic pieces are described in the film. It is both a pleasure to behold on a story level, as well as a film level. Technically, it is parlaying exactly what it is being mystically told as the plot develops. This movie is a classic example why film schools exist.Without giving too much away, this film is a pleasure on many levels, and worth subsequent viewings to fully appreciate and explore. The cast is perfect, as Bale and Jackman play two anti-heroes, whose sides we can easily assume or oppose, depending on how one reads the film and the characters' motives. Johansson plays a wonderful femme fatale, who we never can quite trust. Is she part of the illusion, or the only source of truth? Where does Caine's character's loyalties lie? His performance may perhaps be the best of the bunch, another testament to how prior work with a director leads to greater performances in their own ability to work in shorthand with each other.If you can't tell by my tongue tied review, this film has volumes to speak about. Another thought provoking piece to add to Nolan's young but impressive resume.Grade: A"
" Too dark and mean to be 'magical' to me!
",,"I must admit that this movie was shot beautifully and acted extremely well! I cannot fault the director with the way the story unfolded... my problem was with the story itself! WAY TOO MEAN AND DARK! This wasn't a movie about magic at all; it was a revenge movie plain and simple! I don't need to see happy go lucky endings every time I sit in a theater, but to have two characters that have such self loathing and mutual hatred that only intensifies, is disturbing! At the end of the movie, I watched all characters slip into such a dark and mean place, I wanted every one of them to die! I left the movie wanting the 135 minutes I wasted sitting there returned to me! I think that actors with the talent of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, not to mention the incredible Micheal Cain can choose much better vehicles to showcase their abilities!"
" A Brilliant Masterpiece
",,"The movie was wonderful. It kept me guessing until the very end and when the movie was over I want to see it again. I didn't even recognize David Bowie, who plays Tesla. It was a creepy movie and at times I had to close my eyes. This movie isn't suitable for young children under 13. It involves drowning, shooting and chopping off parts of the body. It has some scary parts, but my 11 year old brother was fine. I would only recommend children that young go if they are mature enough to handle the scary parts. Parents, go see the movie next and then judge to see if it is suitable for your children. Teens, this movie is made for you."
" Well put together -- but not your happy place!
",,"Utterly gripping turn of the century English theater tale. Excellent period feel, costumes, sets, engaging interplay between all the characters, pacing, cinematography, all first rate. The audience is mesmerized by the magic acts, the romantic entanglements, but at the same time, is left utterly cold by the complete lack of warmth and humanity. This is not a movie for someone looking for a uplifting, positive two hours. This movie is devoid of any warmth. There are no heroes, no good guys, no role models.Scientist/inventor Nikola Tesla, whose work all movie goers have seen, even though they may not know it, figures prominently in this movie. Among other things, he invented the Tesla Coil, which is frequently featured in science fiction movies. The coil generates impressive electric displays, like controlled lightning, arcing between electrodes. The main plot of this movie revolves around the use of this electric ""magic"". The movie is not, however, a scientific documentary, and the leaps of logic from Tesla's scientific experimentation, to magic tricks shown in the movie, requires accepting highly implausible events requiring much suspended disbelief, but that fact doesn't detract too much from the movie's allure. The magic is well enough performed to be engaging and plausible. You want to believe it. It works. The movie doesn't entirely satisfy however. The main thing that does diminish the movie's appeal is the unlikable nature of all the principle characters. You just can't ""like"" them, any of them. The movie well worth seeing however. Just don't go when you're in a bad mood already. This movie will only make it worse."
" The Prestige was interesting if maybe a little slow to wade through
",,"When I watched The Prestige with my friend and some of his siblings and friends, I partly fell asleep during some of the passages so I'm not sure if I got the gist of the plot. But I did understand that it went back and forth in time and I understood most of what happened, I'm just not sure if it was compelling enough to really care about what happens during the whole thing. Now Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were fine as were Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie in a small role. Maybe if I were to watch again with a more alert eye I'd give this one a better rating but for now I'm giving this one a 5."
" Proof that an ending can make or break a movie
",,"Man, what a great movie...until the last 5 minutes.""The Prestige"" is a film that makes even the most jaded non-believer stare in awe at feats of magic. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are rivals in the aforementioned field, and develop an acid antagonism when Borden 'accidentally' allows Angier's wife to die suspended in a tank of water. Their vengeance soars on a level both personal and professional, with each vying for the other's popularity, women, and magical secrets. At the core of this is a trick of which no one knows the key--titled 'The Transported Man,' it entails Borden teleporting himself from one place to another; Angier meets up with eccentric electro-magician Tesla (David Bowie), who seems to hold the answer.Director Chrisopher Nolan, who surprised us with ""Memento"" and rejuvenated the ailing ""Batman"" franchise, gives us another worthy, highly entertaining film poised for greatness...until the last 5 minutes. In his remake of ""Insomnia,"" Nolan's characters became slavish victims to the plot, and the same happens at the end of ""The Prestige."" After bobbing and weaving in a multitude of directions and keeping us guessing AND fully invested in the characters, it betrays our trust completely and leaves us with the sour notion that everything that happened in the preceding 2 hours didn't matter all that much.In a movie that pushes the figurative and literal limits of trickery, it seems like a low-brow deception for Nolan to leave us with the last-minute twists that would be more at home in the ""Saw"" series. Bale, Michael Caine, and Jackman (giving his best performance yet) are so strong--and their dispositions so absorbing--that the ending feels like the sort of dishonest fraud we'd get from a Three-Card Monte dealer. Yes, despite the maddening contrivances, ""The Prestige""'s twists DO make sense--but I felt the characters deserved a more sincere, straight-faced coda.In ""Secret Window,"" Johnny Depp told us: ""The most important part is the ending...and this one is very good."" Too bad the same can't be said for ""The Prestige,"" a movie that is so passionately bound for greatness that its last-minute deceptions make the disappointment that much greater."
" Did you watch it closely?
",,"After some of the reviews this film was receiving from the popular press i was quite reticent in going to see it, my major motivation for going was namely the direction of Christopher Nolan and the extremely accomplished acting of Christian Bale, however after i finished watching this film i was nothing but shocked, amazed and truly humbled by one of the greatest pieces of film-making i have seen in rather a long time.I would like to start my review by saying this film is NOT and i repeat NOT about the revelation of the trick and how it was achieved. I have read some rather snooty and sniping comments levelled at this film and how they state that they saw the twist coming from a mile off....that is the point, there are enough clues throughout the film to show the spectator what is going to happen and Nolan does not hide these facts, they are there for a reason and i will not give the true reason away, all i will say is that if you know what makes Psycho and the Usual Suspects such masterpieces then you will know why The Prestige is a film of such ilk.Not only does this film have such a strong story it also sets itself in such a believable period of time, no expense is spared on the set design, the cinematography and editing has all the hallmarks and contemporary feel of a Nolan film, however it adds a haunting and almost tangible feel of impending dread throughout. The immediacy of the film meant as a spectator i was never left flagging and i was shocked to realise that this film was 2 hours and 20 plus minutes long as it felt i had barely sat in my seat before the credits rolled at the end, such the power of this film is that it felt that i had been on a journey with the main protagonists and came out of it a different person.My one concern of this film was the performance of Scarlett Johannsen. I am aware that she is in the film as part of the exposition, however she is that bad and her abilities are that wooden that i still sit here in amazement in how she can still get work in Hollywood, however that is just a small point and thankfully her part is limited.In conclusion i feel that this film will be misinterpreted a lot and if you you like your twists in the Saw or Seven vein (good films that they are) then i feel that you will be left disappointed, however if you want to see a masterpiece of film technique and true grandiose themes then The Prestige will be for you, I watched it closely and i got the point...so the question is did you?"
" Predictable, bland and depressing: Nolan's first failure
",spoiler,"The Prestige is nominally a story of two magicians whose competition and obsession crushes them.The problem is that it never properly works. Told in stacked flashbacks (one reads the diary of the other and flashes back, but within that flashback there are further flashbacks), and with the heavy use of narration, the film seems unusually clumsy. It lacks everything other Nolan films had: Memento had at its core a very simple device which made a very interesting film (the long term memory loss). Following had a simple but effective premise. Insomnia, as film noir filmed entirely in daylight, had a similarly simple subversion at its centre. But The Prestige forgets the elegance if a simple, uniform device, and instead becomes a complicated, but ineffective movie.For example, this is not merely the story of competitive drive among magicians. Fairly early on in the film, one causes the death of the other's wife - which sets off their ever escalating vendetta. Even that story would be more interesting if it weren't for the time-nonlinearity and stacked flashbacks. These gimmicks are supposed to add suspense to the film, but end up ruining it. Finally, the film uses plot twists and revelations throughout - perhaps in line with a film about stage deceivers - but, disappointingly, none of the twists are surprising. Too many hints are interspersed throughout the film, and Michael Caine's speech about the importance of the third act and the titular prestige more or less announces how the film will end.The botched attempts at twists in the tale, the dislikeable characters, the somewhat bland look of the film, and the terrible seriousness with which the film approaches a subject that should really be driven by a sense of mischievous amusement results in a whole that is predictable, bland and depressing. By far the biggest disappointment of the year so far."
" More like ""Memento"" than ""Batman Begins.""
",,"As a former professional magician, the concept of this movie is close to my heart. It was fun seeing Ricky Jay, a real magician, playing a small part. Equally fun was the faithfulness with which most of the magic was presented. Rather than stoop to the level of camera tricks, the magic presented is the same as it would be presented by any modern day magician.Similar to ""Memento,"" this movie skips about in the time line where some information presented earlier makes more sense later when you see it in context. Be prepared for rather plodding plot more in keeping with the offerings of M. Night Shyamalan with a similar style twisting ending. Personally, I guessed the ending too early.Faithfully reproduces the time period.Personally, I think Hugh Jackman (as Robert Angier) and Christian Bale (as Alfred Borden) are too similar looking in appearance and demeanor, which made keep track of who was whom a bit distracting for me."
" My opinion on ""The Prestige""
",,"I had been anticipating this movie ever since it was announced it would be at the helm of Christopher Nolan and written by his brother Jonathan (me, being a big fan of Memento), and became even more excited when i first saw the trailer. It looked serious, moody ,dark and just plain interesting.Upon seeing it a week ago, i wasn't let down. At all.I don't need to write down the whole damn summary for this movie, many others have already done that.If you haven't seen this already, i'll just say that your in for a thrilling, dark, sad, violent,complex and enormously satisfying heck of a movie.The thing is just very well acted through. Bale and Jackman are good as they normally are, and they aren't presented as one-note characters as i've read elsewhere. Their characters have motives for their actions, no matter how unjustified and cruel they are, and it doesn't make it seem like we should pity them for that, no, both guys almost hit the bottom of morality here. Michael Caine does a standard role for him here as the Angier's assistant, but he brings his usual charm and his always good acting chops. Perabo and Johanssen are beauties to behold,and both do a good job, though their roles are minor, especially Scarlett's. Hall is good too, and carries a shocking and very sad aspect of the film very well. And David Bowie as Tesla is one of the coolest cameos,ever.The movie itself may be confusing, as it uses misdirection to present situations out of chronological order, but it's never too confusing, you get the time to organize every situation in time for the finale. The only grip i had with the movie, at least at first, was that it started very slowly and took it's damned sweet time on every minor event, and you might loose some of the initial interest or excitement you had.But at least 45 min. into it, it sets itself on overdrive and never lets you go.Oh, and it looks bad ass. The production values are utterly amazing.Just go see it, forget about infamously obvious twist ending, just let yourself in, put your butt cheeks in the damn seat and let the film surprise you and, well, entertain you."
" Casts a Magical Spell Even Over the Magic non-Fan
",,"After a slow start, during which I was tempted to walk out of the movie (but I did not, because I'd read positive reviews here), ""The Prestige"" did cast its spell over me.""The Prestige"" is visually lush, with high production values. Ornate Victorian coaches, gleaming beaver-skin top hats, high and low rent theaters and slums are recreated in glorious, or inglorious, as appropriate, detail.The actors are all fine. Scarlett Johansson did not annoy me as she usually does; the director got a real performance out of her, as well as got her to wear her usual revealing neckline. Hugh Jackman is well cast as a man with a charming surface and a dangerous, secret interior life. I've never seen Michael Caine more appealing. He's the older mentor character here, and he doesn't seem so much to be performing as just being.Christian Bale is riveting as a young, scary, ambitious Cockney magician.I wasn't crazy about David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. (His name *was* ""Nikola,"" not ""Nicholas."") I think of Bowie as a man who shocks, and he was uninteresting here. Tesla is an historical figure who lived a fascinating, controversial life, and I just didn't see much of that on screen. And Bowie's accent was all wrong; it was a big deal that Tesla was a Serb. Depicting him with a Dutch accent, as Bowie seemed to be doing, is kind of like depicting an African American historical figure as a WASP.Andy Serkis, as Tesla's assistant, was one of the most fun things to watch in the whole movie. I kept thinking, as I was watching him, ""Who is that guy? Have I seen that guy before? Whoever he is, he is really fun to watch."" Dang if it wasn't Gollum, from LOTR.The movie offers a few tidbits from the world of magic -- a cameo by famed NY stage magician and historian of magic, Ricky Jay; discussions of how various tricks were performed; magic lore. But this is never heavy handed, and though I'm bored by discussions of stage magic, these scenes didn't put me off.The plot -- well, I can't say anything about the plot. Part of the reason for watching the movie is the pleasure of attempting to work out the puzzle as you watch the film.The plot is a device to depict two men going at each other's throats, and losing their own souls by doing so. Ambition, Envy, Pride, Competition, Secretiveness, Obsession: lotsa big themes we can all relate to, whether we are Victorian magicians or not.What was missing, for me, in this otherwise quite excellent movie, was any emotional depth.A couple of examples.In his early scenes, I had a hard time believing Hugh Jackman as a hungry young magician. He is in his late thirties, and he looks it.His character is married to a much younger woman, who is blonde and pretty, and passive, as a doll. She's little more than fringe on the stage. I had a hard time believing their marriage. Given the importance, to the plot, of their union, this inability to invest in their marriage was almost fatal to my ability to invest in the movie.A key female character's suicide rang false to me for a couple of reasons. This was a very likable character, and her suicide threw the movie terribly off. Her suicide was never reacted to with any appropriate depth. At that point, the movie really did seem like too much of a wind-up toy that existed only to serve its trick ending.This is especially unfortunate, because a key line, ""I love you today,"" and its ultimate meaning, speaks volumes about the nature of love.Poor Scarlett Johansson, who may never overcome the curse of her lush body and director's urges to exploit it, is made to fall in love a couple of times, and her only motivation for taking this monumental step is that she is given seconds-long scenes in which she looks into a man's eyes and -- SNAP! -- falls in love.With just a little work and a few more lines of dialogue and action to fully animate its female characters, ""The Prestige"" could have been that most perfect of creations, a movie that entertains both men and women. For primarily male viewers, there is the clockwork plot and the cutthroat competition. For female viewers, there could have been fully realized characters, including fully realized female characters, inhabiting a film that has a heart as well as a crafty little head hiding schemes.Instead, the only real warmth in the movie comes from Michael Caine, the wise old man whom directors love in a way that they could never love disposable young female beauties like Scarlett Johansson, and a movie that this viewer could very much like, but never love."
" Powerful !!!
",,"Christopher Nolan has directed excellent movies before. There's always a great deal of mystery in his films. This is no exception. Just like in Memento, in the Prestige he uses a fractured time line, giving the necessary information of the future for you to keep wondering how it got there, but he saves the secret for the last minutes. This film is about two magicians who, having been friends and co-workers, begin a rivalry that will eventually destroy them. Magicians are famous for tricking the public into believing something that's not real. Well, that's exactly what Nolan achieves with his script. It's so meticulously thought that it's almost perfect. If you add that to the acting of Bale, Jackman and the other cast members (Caine, Johanssen, Bowie), a romantic sideline and the sci-fi touch, you get one of the best movies in the decade. No doubt about that."
" Wonderful story of magical rivalry is best seen knowing as little as possible
",,"The second magic related stories to be released in just over a month.Christopher Nolan has constructed an elaborate puzzle box of a movie thats a really good thriller. This is the story of two magicians who attempt to out do each other. The hatred is the result of a tragedy that happened years before on stage. Told in a series of flashbacks the film is a search for the secret of each man's version of the teleported man.Superbly acted, this is one of the rare recent films where the actors, even when big stars like Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine completely disappear into their roles. Its clear why everyone was involved with this film because everyone gets real meaty roles. David Bowie appears as Nikola Tesla and has the best role he's yet to appear in. You really must see this film for the actors if nothing else.You have noticed that I'm rather light on details and thats intentional. This is the sort of movie that is best taken on its face value. You'll want to see the twists and turns of its plot for yourself and not have them spoiled by reviewers and friends who feel the need to tell you too much about the story. What Nolan has constructed is a complex little thrill ride. What I will tell you is that he does play fair, in the end you will know all.For me this is going to require a second or third viewing. Its one of those movies where I'm in love with the construction of the film so much that I have to see it again to see if the thing is as good on an emotional level, I think it is but I'm still distracted by the ""sparklies"" of the box.Go see this film if you like good twisty stories with more than a hint of real magic in them."
" Same old same old from Nolan, which isn't bad but isn't great...
",spoiler,"No, I'm not going to give it away, since that would suck. But I won't hold back from certain problems so it might make it easier to figure out once you see it...This is no 8.5 out of 10. It's just not. It's an adaptation of a book that gets confused, and a mystery that can't be solved because information is missing for a long while, and then once it's provided it's easy, but lame. This is the same problem that Batman Begins, and to a lesser extent, Momento suffers from. The endings are over dramatic and anti-climactic at once, and you are left wishing the movie was shorter and more interesting.I won't give the ""mystery"" away other than to say the magic involved is so lame, it ruins the story by the end. Not the ""illusions"" but the REAL magic you hear about in the trailer, commercials, etc. The illusions were good though, and finding out a little about them as they are executed was entertaining. Not just how they work, but how you come up with them and how to remain ""fresh"" as a magical performer.This movie has a lot of double crosses, but it reaches a point that there is no reason to believe anything being done or said is real. Thus you can't really have a stake in the story, you can't root for anyone, because you don't know who they are nor do you really like them. Everyone's a jerk!! Nobody is a hero, or takes the high road, or seems to have any sort of conscious about killing, maiming, or torturing other people. Everyone is vengeful and selfish and cruel.The directing was all over the map, the plot gets muddled, and the pacing was very slow and labored. Maybe if 20-30 minutes were cut from this film it would have snapped and crackled like the Tesla machines that were misrepresented in the film.And Nolan doesn't seem to care about time-lines and continuity at all. While it might have worked in Momento because of the nature of the film, in Batman the constant time shifting got tiresome, and in this film, despite it being inspired by the way the book works, Nolan does so little to distinguish between time periods and characters at various stages of their lives, you honestly can't tell who they are, when they are supposed to be at that point of the movie, and even what country they are in!And that's pretty much the same complaint I had with Batman Begins. Batman wasn't likable either, the time skips and flashbacks and dreams got to be too convoluted and distracting, the villains got confused (as it was a mystery who was the bad guy, yet information wasn't provided as to why it was a mystery). Batman was also long, and lacked the fun factor, and it was overly dramatic. I guess the new trend in movies is ""no such thing as right or wrong, good or bad"" but I think that POV is as lame as many of the recent movies that espouse it.And finally, to the acting. Michael Caine was being Michael Caine, and he was good enough, but phoning it in. Charlotte was underused and underdeveloped. The others were just there, completely unconvincing and one dimensional. Hugh Jackman had zero star quality in this movie and could have been any actor.Then there's, Christian Bale, who's just too mediocre to pull off these roles. He was mediocre in American Psycho, he was mediocre in Batman, and he's just as mediocre here. He seems very disconnected from the other actors and the arena/world he's supposed to be inhabiting.But hey, what do I know? Others seem to love this movie for some reason. I just thought it was okay. Not a waste of 2 hours, but nothing to recommend to your friends as a must see, either.But if you are looking for film-making or mystery on the level of The Usual Suspects or Fight Club or even the 6th Sense, you'll be disappointed..."
" Is Hollywood actually getting something right this year?
",,"It just seems like I'm seeing a bunch of good movies that have been released in 2006: The Departed, The Illusionist, United 93, and now The Prestige, an exciting magic drama with exciting stars: Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. The Prestige is a well thought out story that keeps you guessing from beginning to end, has great acting, fun magic, and a fantastic look and feel. My friend thought the film was too long, but I thought it was extremely well paced. Believe me, this is a film not to be missed.The Prestige is about two rival magicians Rupert and Alfred, Rupert has showman appeal that gets the audience excited and Alfred has the gift of how to perform magic very well. They go back and forth pulling horrible tricks on each other that not only causes hurt feelings, pain, and death. They also are playing with their lovely assistant's, Olivia, heart. How far will they go just to see who can out magic who? I absolutely loved how much Rupert and Alfred played off each other, you couldn't even choose a side because both of them were complete jerks, if that's even a strong enough word for it, but they did it so well. I loved how they kept trying to figure out each other's secrets and outwit each other in every one of their shows. I have got to tell you that Rupert's shows are so much fun to watch on the screen! There are some good laughs and cries throughout the film and I am not going to be surprised at all if this film is nominated during Oscar time. I would highly recommend The Prestige, one of the best films of 2006!9/10"
" For the look on their faces...to make them Wonder, just for even a moment...
",,"Brilliantly using the role of a magician as an allegory for not just the ""magic"" of film-making, but for the dark, psychologically complex motives of the auteur filmmaker, director Christopher Nolan has dispelled his critics who claim he's just another hack and treated his fans to a twisty delight with ""The Prestige."" This is only his fourth major film (following the neoclassic ""Memento,"" the haunting ""Insomnia,"" and the refreshingly dark ""Batman Begins""), but Christopher Nolan has developed clear visual stamps (i.e. panning crane shots of cold, snow covered locales and close-ups of the protagonist working with his hands), complex thematic elements (getting revenge through acts of showmanship or becoming someone/something else, protagonists riddled with guilt over horrible things beyond their control), and delicate and intricate handling of plot/scripting (folding in on time, multiple points of view, and disjointed chronology) that make him one of the most compelling up-and-coming auteurs working in film today.""The Prestige"" is almost impossible to critique without giving away a major plot twist, as the actual twists make the film so fascinatingly rich in that deep down spooky kind of way. The story of dueling magicians (a fairly good Hugh Jackman and a typically brilliant Christian Bale) gets off to a prodding start after we're told from the opening shot by Bale's eerie voice-over narration to ""watch closely."" Slowly, and inevitably, the tale of one-upmanship and revenge gets under your skin as you try to figure out what the biggest trick is going to be.Where this year's similarly themed ""Illusionist"" was lush and romantic, ""The Prestige"" is brooding and riddled with psychosis. Focusing on one trick and fueled by love, ""The Illusionist"" sucked in viewers. Focusing on the twisting of time and narration and multiple tricks fueled by competition and hatred, ""The Prestige"" transfixes viewers into a slow-burning flicker of mesmerized menace. Like Nolan's other films, the blood really starts to pump in the second half as the actors are allowed to truly emote and chew the scenery (think of Carrie-Ann Moss's turn of character in the later part of ""Memento"" and you'll get an idea of the level Jackman and a superb Rebecca Hall as Bale's wife reach when performing ""the turns""), while the plot mechanizations begin to carefully fall into place and their character arcs intertwine in fantastically tragic ways.Michael Caine (always reliable in these type of mentor roles), Scarlett Johansson (a bit over-exposed this year through no fault of her own by multiple releases but doing a decent British accent here and looking smashing as always), Andy Serkis (a crafty trickster of an actor), and David Bowie (as Tesla) provide fine acting support. Meanwhile, Nolan turns the screws of his mind games tighter than any other bankable director working today and painted a look on my face...that for more than a fleeting moment, but for the entire two-hour runtime and many hours more after, made me Wonder. ""The Prestige"" is pure movie magic."
" Nolan does it again
",spoiler,"There's not much that can be said about The Prestige that has not already been said in its positive reviews. Christopher Nolan makes yet another remarkable achievement after the groundbreaking Memento and the extraordinary Batman Begins. Once again, Nolan does not for a moment prioritize the ""Ooohs!"" and ""Ahhhs!"" before strong character development and plot. By the end, Nolan can use these powerful cinematic tools to create those audience reactions instead of fantastical elements. Nolan is not the only one, however, that makes this movie work as a whole. With his brother, Jonathan Nolan, at the hands of the screenplay, and Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as the leads, people reading this review are only getting the tip of the iceberg with understanding the quality of this movie. You will have to see this movie for yourself.For those who were disappointed by this year's earlier entry in the ""Magician Genre"", The Illusionist, then The Prestige is the movie for you. On terms of quality, the two movies are just about polar opposites. While Edward Norton portrays the most wooden performance I've ever seen from him, Christian Bale shines once more. While Norton and Biel couldn't develop chemistry to save their life, the chemistry is magic between Jackman and Johansson and Bale and Rebecca Hall. While Giamatti and some of the cinematography play as the saving grace of the otherwise disastrous Illusionist, there is really only the overlong ending as a weak spot for The Prestige.I would be really ashamed if Bale does not get some Oscar consideration for this year's upcoming awards season. There is not a scene he doesn't shine in, and time and time again, he proves to be one of the best young actors in Hollywood. It is still a toss up for me on which film is the best of the year. It's either this or The Departed, but you cannot go wrong with either. In the scheme of things, despite the minor flaw at the end, this movie gets a perfect 10, and I now await The Dark Knight even more eagerly. Summer 2008 cannot come soon enough. It takes three great movies for me to label a director a genius. Mr. Nolan, you have a fan."
" Prestige a fun, well made, dark film.
",,"If you compare the book to the movie, the book is actually better. A month before ""The Prestige"" was released I started reading Christopher Priest's award winning book of the same name. I was totally engrossed in it, not only was it a page turner, but it also was an extremely fun read. Not once did I think, ""Oh wow, this is getting boring,"" like most books I read. I was even thinking of writing a review of it because it was so well written, but instead I'll tell you now, READ IT! The book was extremely different from the film, director Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins) took a lot of liberties. But since the two are so different I won't compare them anymore, I'll just talk about the movie. Magicians Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are the best of friends until Borden accidentally kills Angier's wife during a magic show. They part ways, but Angier is suddenly obsessed with taking revenge on Borden. He sabotages one of Borden's shows and ends up wounding him. Now Borden wants revenge. What follows is a series of one-upmanship between the two rivals. Jackman and Bale are brilliant as always, showing the madness of these characters and their need for revenge. Michael Caine plays a mentor-like character named Cutter with a strong cockney accent, and does amazing. The other actors; Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie, are all noteworthy holding their own against the great acting chops of Jackman, Bale, and Caine. One thing that confused me though, it is never really explained why they go to such lengths to hurt the other, when it was an accident to begin with. This was explained in the book, but not in the film. Everything else though was masterfully crafted, and well explained. The cinematography, the somewhat grainy look, the dark and sometimes humorous approach of the film are all trademarks of Chris Nolan. He showed he could direct with ""Batman Begins"" which also starred Bale and Caine- and he has shown it again with ""The Prestige"". It is a fun film, with plenty of twists and turns, and is a great way to spend a Saturday night. Oh, and if you didn't catch my drift before, read the book as well. I give ""The Prestige"" 9 out of 10. It is rated PG-13 for violence and disturbing images."
" Loved this film
",spoiler,"I think this could be Nolan's best movie, I am not sure who wrote this, but who ever did, did a great job. I like the cinematography in this film. It's the same dude who shot Batman Begins, lighting and visuals were awesome. The story was very good, I think I am going to read the book, ha ha. But anyways I wouldn't be surprised if this movie would be in the Academy Awards this as one of the Best Pictures, and if it doesn't make it to Best Picture then I am going to be shocked. I really didn't think Hugh Jackman though was going to be the bad guy, I thought Christian Bale was going to be the bad guy, but it kind of switched around when the Hugh Jackman who wasn't that Lord something, but other than that, I really liked this movie, and I really hope it will go all the way this year."
" One of the most phenomenal movies I have ever seen!
",,"I am very picky when it comes to movies, and I also like all genres. My favorite genre is a psychological thriller. Having said that this movie just blew my mind. In most movies I can figure out the ending well before the movie is over this one I could not, I was still trying to figure it out after the movie was over. This is the type of movie that as soon as you finish seeing it you will want to see it again. This is a type of movie that you must pay attention throughout the entire film. I was one the edge of my seat and my friend next to me was scratching his head and stomping his feet with excitement after the film was over. I would recommend this film to everyone and especially to those who are into psychological thrillers. This film has Oscar written all over it."
" Much better than the usual fair
",,"This was an unusual story, told and acted very well. It took me awhile (and I'm usually very quick) to see where it was going. Like the Illusionist it opens up many a moral dilemma for the audience. The cutting back and forth, at first, is a little hard to follow but then suddenly it becomes much easier and clearer as the movie slows down. The critics who thought that it was too slow in parts were wrong. It has to slow down in order to let the audience catch up. this movie allowed itself to be suspenseful, sad, funny and thought provoking all at the same time. It might not be Number #1 this week at the box office but it's interesting enough that people will go see if for week after week."
" Don't read anything about this movie until you have seen it.
",,"The best way to experience this film is to know nothing about it. I didn't do any research for this film, and I feel that made the film so much better for me. All of the surprises were genuine and I really had to think about what was going on. That's rare for me, and I like David Lynch.This was just such an effective film in terms of sophisticated entertainment. Not a film to miss. I don't want to say anymore because I could very well ruin something for you, which is not something I want to do. Just see it, and when you do, go into it blind and without any preconceived notions. It makes it so much better."
" The drowning of imagination
",,"Why Christopher Nolan's movies are so popular? Until you understand that, you will continue to wonder why people spend a lot of money and time to be imprisoned into dull and boring movies; Christopher Nolan knows exactly what he's doing, and he's known it from the start. And what's that he's got for you? A prefabricated universe dominated by figures with no soul and lungs: his audience likes the excitement of drowning their little imagination again and again; for them, films have to be that deadening and useless - and once they have watched them, they might say 'that was really good' a great many time before they get reanimated - lol! that is all right, because their understanding is so nimble to realize their error, which will be forgotten much more quickly than a dream."
" Good Movie, but a Let Down
",spoiler,"Okay, so everyone i know is raving about how good the prestige is. I admit myself that it looked really good on the trailers. Maybe its because i had such high expectations that i was so devastated by this terrible ending. If you've seen the movie you know the whole time everyone is questioning how the real transported man works. You keep wondering, if its not a double then HOW THE HECK IS THE TRICK DONE!?!!?!! Its a classic move, make a mystery the whole movie, and then when the explanation comes at the end everyone is amazed. This should be how it works. But the prestige ignores all convention and lays down that terrible terrible ending. The whole point of the movie is that you wonder how the trick is done. Then when they reveal it you are expecting some really cool trick. ""how does the man make his body transport?"" for some reason the answer to that question is: He simply clones himself and drowns himself every night! DUH! ARE YOU KIDDING ME? Im expecting some cool trick and the explanation of how he does the impossible trick is that he does an equally impossible thing. Thats not an explanation thats just another impossible thing. Thats like me making a movie where a certain person can come back from the dead and saying ""okay the trick is that he can time travel and just avoid his original death!"" ""get it? i explained it for u!!!"" Okay well because of that i gave it a 3, it got a 3 cuz the movie was good but the ending was a big let down."
" Overwrought. Falls to its own potential
",spoiler,"The writers tried to pack 10 pounds of story into a 5 pound bag. Combining the material for four clever stories into one did not work. Plot holes developed quickly and the audience was let down with weak points and bad cuts.Plot holes.1: There was no indication that Bale's character was doubled by a Tesla machine. It only showed him attending a hastily-sketched Tesla demonstration.2: The solution to the problem with Bales' lover and wife was a plothole: If he had an asbolute clone, would that clone not love the wife as much as the original? They _both_ loved the daughter equally.2a: If one clone did _not_ love the wife, why would he bother going to her? The clones could were already using disguises and living separate lives - they could have maintained separate loved ones as well.3: If the light bulbs needed no wires then why did the one Jackman picked up go out when he did? I know this has to do with Tesla's wireless electricity and that the bulb had been in a socket, but it's not presented coherently.4: The light bulb Jackman holds when being greeted by Tesla illuminates when Tesla holds his hand. Bodies conduct electricity, sure, but they don't generally store it too well.Weak points / bad cuts: 1: Throw-away inside joke: ""He's an out of work actor,"" speaking of the alcoholic.2: Cut from the birdcage falling on the woman's hands - Jackman was so unshaken that it made the accident unintentionally hilarious.3: The escalating violence between the magicians quickly became funny instead of tense. Audience can only sustain repeated shocks a few times before they respond with laughter.4: How many times does the three steps of a magician have to be repeated? The first time I heard it - it set a good mood. The second time - no problem, it must have something to do with the theme of the movie. Third, fourth, and fifth times - alright, give me a break.This movie had me for the first 20 minutes, but after 2 hours I almost walked out. I can only stand a butt-numb-athon if my interest is held. So much was crammed into so little time that the efforts of the actors was largely wasted. Potential is a movie's greatest enemy, and this movie's potential got the best of it by far. The costumes and set pieces and capture of the era was good. The inaccuracies concerning Tesla can be overlooked. But I have zero interest in enduring this film again. I would say it's Nolan's first failure thus far."
" Not THAT Presgious
",spoiler,"I went to this movie expecting to be blown away. After the amazing movie with EDWARD NORTON, I was expecting too much. This movie was OK, don't get me wrong. The scene at the end when Wolverine is talking to Christian Bale was Oscar WORTHY to say the least. However, I grew tired of the cockney accent that Bale had through the entire flick. The ending was a bit contrived. Sure, this movie had a good ending but it was a little too strange with the entire TWIN thing. I didn't see that coming. I guess I should have read the book, no? Oh where should I begin on the plot? It was very strange to see Tesla being portrayed by David Bowie. That was a very weird part of this entire movie. Did Tesla really build stuff in the mountains of Colorado? Who knows. All I know is that Michael Caine was so so in this movie and the plot was not that great."
" Read the novel instead
",,"I finished reading the darkly elegant novel ""The Prestige"" by Christopher Priest about a week before renting the DVD. Perhaps I was setting myself up for disappointment, but the movie is an absolute dog; it pales in comparison to the novel. I have to wonder what Christoper Priest thinks of this film.Call me a purist, but I would love to see the novel made into a movie that respects the story's original plot structure. Too much that is worthwhile in the novel, such as the addition of Borden's and Angier's descendants to frame the story, has been deleted. Too much that is ridiculous has been added to the film. The story has been butchered beyond belief. I realize that Nolan is known for playing with the chronology of events, but his piecemeal approach destroys any possibility of real dramatic tension building towards any sort of climax.One of the strengths of the novel was that the story was told largely in the form of diaries the two magicians had written. This offered us some back story to give context to the conflict between Angier and Borden, and also allowed us to get inside their heads. The characterizations in the movie, are for the most part, extremely one-dimensional and superficial - completely without subtlety. The acting is mostly a snore, with flat performances from most of the actors, an exception being Rebecca Hall, who showed some emotional depth and engaged the viewer. At least the special effects were snazzy. But far more electricity was generated by Tesla's machine than existed between any of the characters, which is really too bad. I just got bored with it all.If you haven't seen this picture, don't waste your time. Just read the book."
" Disappointing
",spoiler,"I am a huge Hugh Jackman fan. And I love movies with intrigue, magic, supernatural. I am also a big fan of Christian Bale after Batman Begins.Having these two people in a movie and watching the incredible previews. I went to the movie expecting it to be FANTASTIC. Although the movie was composed fantastically and the actors were pretty good. The movie seemed too long and I kept waiting for it to end. I get that it was all about obsession but come on with great actors and an even greater director you expect a lot more. Micheal Caine was the saving grace. Also since I don't know much about magic it was interesting to see the kind of engineering and physics it requires. It was disappointing on the whole."
" Waste of time
",,"Whenever I can identify a bad movie at first sight it makes me laugh and not at all angry. Al least I know what genre I see and this makes me calibrate my expectations. The word ""magic"" causes three different levels for me: 1.Real magic,you may believe or not like being told existing in other cultures 2.The magic of illusionists like Mr.Copperfield and friends and 3.The typical writers magic like Potter or Jeckyll/Hide(pure fiction) I saw this movie without any previous knowledge about the book or plot. It started well and I liked it although it ""twisted"" my mind a bit.Seemed to be about the second type (Copperfield) so even as it is a movie I believed that these ""tricks"" exist,not expecting to be given away. Then the shock with this ""clone"" idea.The movie changed its genre and every thought I had before was worthless.The movie became ""ridiculous""(thanks Jo) In the end I hoped the two guys might become friends invent a new sparkling machine to immortalize and call themselves Siegfried and Roy"
" A promising film becomes an infuriating waste of time (contains spoilers)
",spoiler,"This contains spoilers but the film deliberately spoils its own plot.I loved the first half of the film - thinking I was in for multiple insights into magician's tricks and for the narrative to play similar tricks on the viewer. In fact, of course, a trick is played on the viewer, but it is infuriating, disappointing, cynical and ultimately leaves you feeling cheated. I give two stars out of 10 because it is well shot and the first third/half is done well - 0 out of 10 for the rest of the film SPOILERS: The film sets up and then deliberately telegraphs what the ""answer"" is to Borden's trick, (which is the same ""answer"" to the plot). The idea is to get the audience to guess that Fallon is Borden's double, but then to reject it because it is so obvious and too poor a denouement to a two-hour film, which is predicated (eg, by Cutter's VOs) on being clever and which is constantly, if implicitly, bragging that it will fool you. It plays upon the sophisticated modern viewer's knowledge that there must be a very clever solution at the end of the film - then defeats your expectations when the exceptionally obvious solution (which has been continually raised throughout the film) is, in fact, the real and only solution. So you have the jarringly obvious clues that Borden is two people which occur right the way throughout the film, in the comments of his wife for instance; the painfully obvious underplaying of Fallon's character (in a film in which Tesla is played by David Bowie, you very quickly notice you don't even know which bizarre choice of actor the casting director has called upon to play Fallon, while it is rather comically obvious at all times that he is wearing ""a disguise"") - and of course, Cutter simply announces that Borden obviously has a double. The only reason given for this not to be true is that his double has also lost his fingers - given Borden's insistence that you have to sacrifice yourself for your art, it is easily guessed that the double has cut his fingers off too. Just as the characters within the film denounce the ""double"" solution as being too obvious, so the audience is meant to - Nolan creates this ""answer"" in such a way as to make it look like a red herring. When the red herring turns out to be the true plot twist and not mis-direction, you have been fooled - but in a deeply disappointing way - the only twist is that, in fact, there is no twist. Instead of leaving you gasping in admiration at the cleverness of a plot ""trick"", the film simply leaves you annoyed and disappointed. Of course, Cutter and Borden have been saying all along, while talking of tricks, that it is very disappointing when you realise how obvious the solution to a trick is - but this should not apply to the denouement of a film - you should not be disappointed. This disillusionment was very quickly followed, in my case at least, by the realisation that the doubles ""plot"" is ludicrous - why don't Borden and ""Fallon"" not tell the wife that there are two of them, which would solve her suicidal anguish and, presumably, the anguish of one of the brothers. Instead,the twins/doubles allow her to believe her husband is having an affair and doesn't love her half of the time - when in fact her husband loves her all the time and is not having an affair, it is his twin who is sleeping with Olivia. In fact, why do they keep swapping roles and Borden/Fallon alternate who talks to the wife? It is merely cruel, pointless and, of course, has only occurred to serve the feeble plot line. How anyone can call this a 10/10 film is utterly beyond me.There is a final insult to the viewer's intelligence - while Borden's trick turns out to have the obvious solution, Angier's trick is not a trick at all - it involves some sort of sci-fi Star Trek teleporter. You are also shown this before the end, so even this deeply poor ""solution"" is not kept as some sort of final revelation.Waste of two hours of my time - I'm still angry about it so it has basically screwed another hour afterwards too"
" Dueling magicians and sworn enemies try and outwit one another in 1897 London.
",spoiler,"Angier (Jackman) is killed at the start of the movie. Borden (Bale) is in prison for the murder, reading Angier's journal which is quoting a magic tricks book Angier stole from Borden! Huh? Woefully directed by Nolan this great-looking but pretentious mush-mash flashes back, forward, and simultaneous sideways so that without your own story board you won't follow it. But you won't care! This turn of the 19th century atmospheric but odd movie about dueling magicians, their hate for one another, a mystery that binds them, and their growing young art is too uneven. It dwells on the atmosphere and deep-secreted illusions and forgets character development and reality. Is this mess sci-fi or drama-thriller? I say junk."
" Some very interesting plot twists and originality, though it's a bit grim and lifeless
",spoiler,"After seeing that this film is in the IMDb top 100, I thought it was a film I must see. Now that I've seen it, I feel a bit disappointed. Now I must admit that the film was terribly original and had some odd twists, though the film overall is awfully grim and lifeless--mostly because it was hard connecting with the characters.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play magicians who are partners. Things go very well for a while until Jackman's wife is accidentally killed doing a dangerous trick. Jackman blames Bale for this and you really can't tell if Bale did anything wrong or if it was just a sad tragedy. Regardless, Jackman spends the rest of the film persecuting Bale and trying to destroy him. After a while, Bale begins fighting back and it's an all-out war with horrible consequences. I won't say more--because I don't want to spoil the film. However, I will say that it gets really, really, really weird when Nicola Tesla (played very well by David Bowie) enters the fray--creating the ultimate magical box for Jackman.Aside from the magic box being ridiculously anachronistic, the film is so slow and hard to love--despite it's wonderful twists. It's hard to like either of the magicians (particularly Jackman) and after a while I lost interest--mostly because of the pacing and disagreeable characters. Overall, I greatly respect the film but also didn't particularly enjoy watching it."
" Many twists and turns in this intelligent enjoyable film
",,"I can't wait to say that I loved this film! It was gripping, engaging, and surprised me a few times. I mean genuinely surprised me. The film is about rival stage magicians, rife with their lingo and culture, but more importantly, the film works much like a magic trick or illusion, offering its own misdirections while showing you everything. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were both superb as the obsessed magicians. Scarlett Johansson and Piper Perabo were very good as supporting female leads, though one of the best performances in the film was from Rebecca Hall. She made me want to look up her filmography. Michael Caine and the few others in immediate supporting roles were all good. I've heard mixed things about David Bowie's appearance in this film, but I think he was just fine; his appearance is more an extended cameo than anything else. The sets are authentic looking for the period, the writing is excellent, and even the music was excellent, if a bit subtle. The direction was superb, as was the editing. This is the rare film that gets everything right while telling a compelling story. It combines solid drama with an intriguing mystery and more than a hint of the fantastic I am hesitant to say anything about the plot, other than it concerns rival stage magicians in late nineteenth century London. Even the trailers for the film show precious little, probably for the same reason. Well worth the price of admission, I urge those interested to see it while its on the big screen."
" Another Gem from Nolan!
",,"I really loved this movie and can not even really think of anything else to compare it to. It's just so dark and edgy, it reminds me of a cross between early Tim Burton and David Fincher in its delivery. So mystical but still connected with reality and powerful. I think I'm still recovering...The acting is excellent, Bale is solidifying himself as one of the best actors out there, Jackman's great, and I like the fact that Scarlett Johanssen's role in the film clearly was not expanded just because she signed on, her presence only adds to the film without trying to be bigger than the story.I would highly recommend this movie and have to say that this movie, along with a few other recent releases (Science of Sleep, Departed, etc) is an encouraging sign of where the movie industry is headed..."
" This movie is a boon to magicians everywhere! I highly recommend it!!!
",,"I went to this movie with high hopes and high expectations. Being a magician myself I was a little wary that the director would not show the true life of a magician. I was not let down. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were wonderful as magicians. Even the eccentric David Bowie was amazing as the scientist Tuslo. At the beginning of the movie we find that Christian Bale is being put on trial for the murder of his fellow magician Hugh Jackman. It then goes back in time and shows you the real reasons that Hugh Jackman and Christian were fighting. When Hugh's wife dies during an act I was very proud of the director. This event was like that of Harry Houdini who died after performing such a trick. If you love murder, a good story, and a good old fashioned rivalry I highly recommend this movie."
" Nolan Raises the Bar
",,"Christopher Nolan is incredible at creating suspense. This movie is all about secrets; secrets between friends, secrets between enemies, and secrets from the audience. As Nolan seems to like to do in his movies, he does a great job of keeping the audience out of the loop and always a step behind. When good directors make a few good movies, it's easy to slip along the way. Each new movie they make is another chance for them to fail, and people start to anticipate these failures because they hold each new film to a higher standard than the previous one. He hasn't disappointed me yet.The acting is well done. I don't think anyone would expect a poor performance from Michael Cane, Christain Slater, or Scarlett Johanson, and they definitely didn't achieve anything less than expected. Hugh Jackman proves to be a talented actor in an artistic film, not just a high budget Hollywood production."
" Great! Kept me on the edge of my seat!
",,"Let me commence my abridgment by stating that this movie is one to remember--it's a masterpiece. It left me with curiosity every minute of the movie. Contrary to other movies, the twists and turns cannot be anticipated. This is truly worth the eight dollar student ticket, and it would not leave you with regrets. This movie is a must! I am no critic, but this movie would be ""two thumbs way up."" In comparison to his other wonderful movies, Batman Beins and Momento, i would say this is the best. And i must admit Batman Begins was one outstanding movie. The acting in the movie reflects the ""old"" times. The plot was well written and nothing was flawed. If you plan to watch a movie, i would recommend this one."
" Prestigious.....Not!
",spoiler,"One might say that the best part of ""The Prestige"" is the ride to the theater. Those who say that are moronic. On the ride to the movie house you are mistakenly in the frame of mind that what you are about to see will be, in fact, entertaining and watchable. The best part of this film is the ride home for then the most arduous 2 hours spent in a theater in recent time are over. This film explains itself to you via Michael Cain's narrative of the three parts in a Magicians performance: at first an infant mewling and puking in his nurse....wait, thats something different. The First Act is called The Pledge, in which a magician displays an everyday object; act two is The Turn, in which that everyday object is made to do something extraordinary, such as disappear; and act three is The Prestige, in which the object reappears, dazzling an audience too afraid to applaud at the end of act two. The movie basically follows this pattern except The Prestige in this film is not dazzling at all, instead painfully obvious. Anyone who has seen the STTNG Episode ""Second Chances"" will not be in the least surprised. Those who haven't and have a brain in their head will not be. That said, my girlfriend and I were the only two people with brains in their head at the screening we attended. This auditorium was dazzled. People will come to see this film because all of the people involved are hot commodities right now. I suspect they will be disappointed."
" Even Michale Bay Could Have Done Better...
",spoiler,"This movie sucked. A cloning device, seriously? I can't decide what is worse, Da Vinci Code or this... What horrible screenwriter(s)...Seriously, cloning???Seriously?If he had half a brain or the screenwriter had half a brain he would have realized it would be more magical to do an illusion where the magician was shot and pronounced dead, and brought back to life 10 minutes later! Would that not be the best trick ever???WORST MOVIE EVER...At least Da Vinci Code had a story, however similar it may seem to National Treasure...This movie is horrible. Enough said. Fine don't listen to me then. Go watch it and see."
" The Prestige vs The Illusionist
",,"Although both movies have certain similarities, Victorian, magicians, beautiful people, twist endings, there is one huge difference, ""The Illusionist"" is enjoyable while ""The Prestige"" is a pretentious, manipulated, confusing, mess. The character development is especially weak, the accents barely intelligible, and the time jumps annoying. If the movie had played out in an orderly fashion, it might have proved more enjoyable. I cannot recommend ""The Prestige"". If you must see a magical movie, and enjoy being manipulated toward a twist ending, then ""The Illusionist"" is your movie. At least it makes a little bit of sense. Rate ""The Illusionist"" 7.0, ""The Prestige"" 3.0 - MERK"
" Decent Movie, but...
",,"I have to say, when I saw the trailers I was expecting... something more. Its NOWHERE near as thrilling as commercials will lead you to believe. The movie is 2 hours, which isn't a bad thing, except for the way the directors seemed to just stretch and stretch the storyline as far as it can possibly go. The story is somewhat hard to understand, because it will sort of flash from the past to the present and you sort of lose track if your not watching closely. I was expecting much more from this movie, so don't get your hopes up too high, especially if your expecting a non-stop thriller. Okay so overall a pretty decent movie, interesting storyline, but hard to understand a lot of the time unless your watching closely."
" Epic Tale About Tricksters
",,"I am not the biggest fan of Nolan's works (some are good but imho some are pretty overrated/praised like Dunkirk and Interstellar), but this one is (like Inception) a really nice gem with an unusual story.A unique plot woven around two obsessed and rival magicians/illusionists with an amazing cast - Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and Michael Caine. And on top we get a nice painting of the times around the end of the Nineteenth Century.Good and entertaining."
" Multiple Parallel Realities
",spoiler,"This is a film about multiple parallel realities, so astonishingly well made that I never saw the final plot twist coming.The main plot is two warring magicians (mirrored by the warring real life magicians Tesla and Edison).-The secondary plot is the realities of life pretended or performed alongside with ""real"" life. We see the onstage performances, and the reality of the performers afterwards.The consequence of which is -multiple existence of beings, although they don't come right out and say ""clones"".The narrative is unrolled backwards and forwards in bits, recounted in part by two overlapping diaries, each one a ruse.The handheld camerawork is the best thing about the movie. The almost imperceptible movements, suggesting that the audience is unmentioned character, always there lurking about. It haunts me. I rematch this movie just for the camerawork sometimes."
" decent
",,"This was a movie about rival illusionists who are hell-bent and obsessed with learning each other's secrets. After a trick goes horribly wrong, one becomes more obsessed. I liked the cast and the magic tricks, but feel like the movie dragged and was too slow in places. Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman, David Bowie, and Scarlett Johansen were all good as the stars. If you want to see a movie about illusionists and magic and rivals, this might satisfy you.** out of ****"

" An amazing film you should definitely see
",,"This is an amazing film. Its a film that makes want to see it again instantly after you've first seen it, partly cause you want to see if everything makes sense, and also cause of how spectacular it is. One of the things I loved about this film was that it never felt like either Huge Jackman's or Christian Bale's character was more important than the other. Both of them are equally as interesting and well performed. The way Christopher Nolan doesn't tell the story in in a typical way and instead decided to jump back and forth from different parts in the story was a genius move. He did it in a way so that it was confusing but never too confusing, how he managed to do that is beyond me. It also never focused too much on the actually magic and was always about the rival between Huge Jackman and Christian Bale. All the performances are great as well. the only bad thing was Scarlett Johansson's British accent which was pretty awful."
" what a movie!!!
",,amazing movie you have to watch it to the last second i never get bored during this film they show the reality of the magic with an entertainment and some adventure through it with an excellent cast you need to keep thinking for the first 90 minutes what is happening?! and how it happens?! you will start to understand everything in the last five minutes and see how everything is so easily even if your mind complicate it!!!!
" ""Are you watching closely""
",spoiler,"Authentic tricks , Shallow deaths, deadly secrets, a twisted plot and a painful obsession. Once again Christopher Nolan has brought us another sensational film. I just recently watched this movie and felt the need to watch it a second time. In this dramatic thriller Alfred Borden (christian Bale) and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) try to discomfit each other in becoming the better magician. Robert Angier started off as brilliant as Berenice but then towards the end of the film became malefic. You will descry shocking conclusions about these characters. The complex plot twist makes this film even better in a way that leaves you wanting more. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman did a fabulous job playing their roles.The way how everything is filmed just compels you. You may have to watch the movie again to have a truly better understanding of what has happened. I strongly recommend this brilliant film.""Abra Cadabra"" -tasha"
" A must watch movie
",,"There can't just be a better movie than this. The Prestige turned out better than any movie I had watched so far. A magician's life is surely more complex than what I thought earlier. I simply loved Christian Bale's double role. Michael Caine only made it too perfect. Hugh Jackman did his bit as expected, and so deserves mentioning. The movie definitely deserves a rating much better than it's current. Maybe very few people watched it. The Prestige may just be considered Christopher Nolan's best till date. A must watch for people of all ages. It deserved better than everything it earned-in terms of both popularity, as well as gross."
" Brilliant, Under-rated film
",,"I think this film is a vastly under-rated feature and is one of Nolan's best in terms of the narrative and plot. The film is great in that it keeps you thinking throughout with it's woven non-linear structure and the cast that are in the film seem perfect for their respective characters, the film charts the personal and professionally rivalry between two magicians in the Victorian age with each ruining each others performances in a different number of ways before building up to it's twist of a climax, Michael Caine plays his role well as the fatherly figure for Algier (Hugh Jackman)whilst the leading cast play it well as two men obsessed with topping the other as things take a turn for the worst the more the film plays out, for me Bale's character Borden is the better of the two but Jackman still puts in a great performance."
" Mr. Christopher Nolan: A Genius
",,"After watching the newest Nolan's film: The Dark Knight Rises, a real let down, I had to remind myself how good of a director Mr. Christopher Nolan is. I watched for the 4th time the Prestige.Contrary to Following and Memento, you do not know until the end that there is something more than what you see Until the end!. And then you watch it again and notice all the clues. It's one of these plots which seems so simple but as in magic tricks, nothing is what it seems.It's a great screen play of Christopher Priest's novel. The cast is incredible and Christian Bale needs to be congratulated for his versatility. Mr. Nolan did it again and the illusion is great. I was wondering how he could out do Following and Memento and he pulled one over my eyesagain. No, I won't tell you the plot because other people already did that and if I was to tell you more I would be spoiling the movie for you. Let's just say that I would have hated to have missed watching such a great movie. Please, enjoy it and know that you won't be disappointed. In fact, you will remember the Prestige for quite a while."
" Stunning
",spoiler,"Warning!!! Contains LOT's of spoilers!So yesterday's evening on TV where running this movie called The Prestige. Before movie I sure checked it on IMDb and saw that is has 8.4 and it has won 2 Oscars. That sure made it worth watching.Evening came and movie started. I played Splinter Cell Conviction and actually weren't in a mood for watching a movie (now thought that I could exchange this movie for SC:C just horrifies me...). First 20 minutes of movie passed. I weren't paying too much attention to movie and didn't understood what's going on. Then I stopped playing SC and thought : ""That's all! Let's watch movie.""It wasn't easy to understand what's going on but slowly I managed to put everything in places. After all I missed only beginning of movie. As I watched movie I became pulled into movie even more. It was amazing to watch those two Illusionists battle with each other, their tricks, acting in home life and other stuff ( Thank you Jackman, Thank you Bale... You made my evening!). They went even further in their competition, using more unfair methods. I were completely pulled in movie. Movie's storyline was one the best I've seen lately. And then the ending come. The best part. I were totally amazed about Angier's and Borden's game in trying to kill each other. How Angier used his double to send Borden in Jail and how Borden's twin brother sacrificed himself for Borden. In the end I can surely say this is one of the best movies I've seen...P.S. And as the movie ended, and I sat completely stunned tit res appeared and I firstly saw Nolan's name. A smile showed up on my face. ""Of course. Nolan. Who else?"" Was my first thought."
" Are YOU watching closely...?
",,"A film about magicians, friendship, jealously and rivalry. It's very hard to sell this film and to try to explain it without giving too much of the (pardon the pun) 'magic' away. A tale of two magicians set in Victorian England where their friendship turns sour when an act they routinely perform goes horribly wrong. The pair part company and a rivalry ensues. A bitter feud emerges when they both try to outdo each other with an array of tricks and illusions. From the outset it may seem like this film is all about magic and the art of illusion, but it isn't.Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film follows a similar structure to his previous effort Memento where the narrative doesn't start at A and follow on to B. Instead there is flashbacks and flash forwards, as the reveal and revelation is slowly bought forward. We embark on a merry-go-round where we are left guessing where it stops and where we get off, but the level of intrigue that it creates just keeps you wanting more. To truly enjoy, appreciate and most importantly understand the film, your attention is required from start to finish and focus must be retained throughout. It's not a film you can switch off and come back to.From the off, we are given an explanation of the three part structure to every major trick, the pledge, the turn and the prestige. The prestige is the final reveal, the re-appearance from a disappearing act, making the impossible seem possible... What follows is a trail where the magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) accused of murdering his rival Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). From there on in the story unfolds with Borden reading Angier's diary where the first flashback occurs and the start of complex twists and turns showing how they started out as friends and with the eventual fall out which turns them to bitter rivals, with Angier trying to uncover how Borden achieves his greatest magic trick 'the transported man' and out do him.Funnily enough, this film so weirdly different and it's not what you'd expect. It set in Victorian England yet it never once feels like a period drama. Detail is key, as the focus is with the characters and never the background. Of course the costume and setting provides the backdrop for the story but the main theme is about obsession.Both leads (Bale and Jackman) are on fine form and the rest of the supporting cast raises the bar. The performances are subtle and sublime, with the nuances and deliberate misdirection to mislead us into thinking who we see as the bad guy may not be the villain of the piece. That isn't to say that there is a villain but nothing is ever clear in this wonderfully realised screenplay.Such an understated film with much to get your brain cells a work out, there's a lot to take in and you may not see everything the first time round but as the first lines mentions ""are you watching closely?"" there is a lot to admire about how the whole thing is constructed and like any great magic trick, the film only allows the audience enough details to carefully reveal the smaller pieces of a puzzle where we, the audience have to fit together to see the bigger picture. Is what we see the real truth or is there something more otherworldly, supernatural or unexplainable. With elements of science fiction thrown in you wonder whether things can get any weirder but when the final act is revealed you may well feel cheated or left feeling a sense of wonderment and just like a magic trick, you think to yourself, how did they pull that off? if you liked my review please visit my blog http://fsfilm.blogspot.com"
" Christopher Nolan gives us another masterpiece
",,"""Are you watching closely?"" The Prestige is yet another mesmerizing film helmed by Christopher Nolan. A masterpiece in most respects, it sucks the audience in with its complex and riveting narrative and benefits from an amazing cast and fantastic production choices. So often movies which play like a puzzle don't hold up well upon repeat viewings, but The Prestige not only holds up, it flourishes. Every viewing reveals more of the impressive way Nolan foreshadows what's to come, giving the viewer everything they need without resorting to cheats. Every detail is thought out, every clue carefully placed. With its opening voice-over, Michael Caine informs the viewer exactly what the film will accomplish and how you will feel. It works as an epic tale of obsession and revenge, and it works as a magic trick all itself. But beneath the illusions and misdirection lies an impressively deep tale with a lot on its mind. Keep an eye out for a great performance by David Bowie as well as inspired turns by leads Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. As the film points out, ""You want to be fooled.""This one will have you wanting to see it again as soon as it ends."
" Nolan at his Best
",,"Welcome to the world of magic. Nolan drives us through an unforgettable journey in the world of Passion (read as magic), Ego (tussle to outclass your competitor at any cost) and a thrilling cinematographic masterpiece which is here to stay. Chistopher Nolan is known more for his work in modern classics like Memento (2000) & the Batman series but this movie remains my personal favourite of his works. Michael Caine and Chritian Bale (both personal favourites of Nolan while casting) give an stellar performance yet again but the one who completely dazzled me in this one is Hugh Jackman. The man to man war between Jackman & Bale to outsmart each other in the magic tricks is a treat to watch. Scarlett Johannsson is pretty as always and gives good support to the men here.The Non linear Story telling (which is trademark of Nolan's work) only adds to the suspense and beauty of this film. As the pages are unfold, It completely keeps you on the edge of your seats. I would definitely not like yo ruin your experience by leaking something out of the story. Watch out for the climax which completely left me dazzled personally.The 1900's set up charismatically elevates the cinematic experience & the background score is dangerous for your nails (Pls don't bite ur nail while watching this :P). I rate this movie 10/10 as very few films have impressed me to this level. Good Work Nolan and keep it up. Eagerly waiting for your Inception (2010). I recommend this for everyone personally as this roller coaster ride through Nolan's vision is a rarity. Don't miss it at any cost."
" The real transported man.
",,"Class!!!!One word that can outline this prestigious movie.Christopher Nolan after the success of Memento has again shown what qualities he possesses as a director.The script is fantastic.Where does he get those ideas from.Christian Bale again gives a fantastic performance.He has grown as an actor in the past few years.Hugh Jackman does justice to his role.The screenplay is awesome.Also the work of Michael Caine(cutter) is prolific.He keeps saying those one liners that always impress me.Prestigious indeed is the twist at the end.WOW!!!What a twist ??You need to watch this movie twice to understand the mind of Christopher Nolan.Only one question twists me,where does he get all those ideas??Finally prestige has all the answers.Waiting for his next movie.If you believe in magic.The real transported man holds the answers.Also,remember exact science is not exact science.Prestige is the hardest part.But then who was prestigious at the end.Must watch!!"
" Pulling strings
",,"Using advanced storytelling techniques (see the Advanced Screen writing Class and the Masterpiece Software) is probably the single best way to set yourself apart from the Hollywood screen writing crowd. But this approach is extremely challenging as well, and if you aren't careful you can weaken the very story you are trying to showcase.In their story of competing magicians, the writers of The Prestige use a double storyteller. While not uncommon in a medium like the novel, this advanced technique is extremely rare in mainstream Hollywood film. Structurally a double storyteller creates two equal main characters. When you have virtually unlimited amount of time to explore character (as in a novel), this isn't a problem. But in the relatively short two-hour time period you have in a Hollywood movie, it's a huge problem.If you add the advanced technique of making both characters unsympathetic, you compound the problem even further. Contrary to the conventional wisdom, characters don't have to be sympathetic. But they do have to be compelling. By cross-cutting between two main characters in the time a writer normally has to define one, these writers make both of their heroes superficial and opaque.The great strength of The Prestige is the plot. But ironically, that simply highlights the fatal weakness of the story. This film about slight of hand and trickery has plenty of slight of hand and trickery in its plot. But without the proper character work, it's all just pulling strings. By being extra complicated, the mechanics of the plot actually become more, not less, obvious. The audience pulls back and notices they are watching a movie.Instead of showing us how clever they are, these talented writers show us how they have failed in the first job of the writer, to make the audience care.FOR MORE REVIEWS, please visit www.truby.com"
" Shakespearian in both scope and quality
",,"If the script for The Prestige was found in Shakespeare's house, it would credibly be accepted as his work. It is firmly based in period facts, and goes beyond them. It has the gorgeous talent of allegory, appealing to all, and to each at different levels. If you follow them all, the movie will bring a shiver to your spine when, as layers of reality, each as real as the next, are peeled away in this shrewed screen play, revealing men and man, women and woman, tragedy and joy. So many fragments of the story mirror others: wife's and partners and girl-friends and Daedalus-like science... yet the film holds them all clear in mind. The film itself is finely crafted: gorgeous detailed sets reward the eye, and multiple viewings. The casting is perfect: Bale at his driven, rather than simply raging best. Jackman, so brilliantly failed and jealous, Scarlet and Rebecca hall, in a partnership completely distinct from VIcky Cristina, but which must surely have alerted Woody Allen's eye.David Bowie is perfect and his own fame helps convey Tesla's own struggle with being ahead of his time. The presence of Andy Serkis (You MUST see him in Einstein and Eddington) is becoming a code for must-see movie.This is, simply, one of the best movies of the decade."
" Are you watching closely??
",,"When Christopher Nolan made his debut into American cinemas with Memento, film-lovers witnessed the first rumblings of a creative genius who brought innovation and artistic flair to theaters with his unique visual and narrative style. Since that time, I've eagerly awaited each of his subsequent films with the hope that his unique cinematic style would continue to develop. I haven't been disappointed. In 2005, Mr. Nolan directed what many fans believe to be, arguably, the best of the Batman films, finding both critical and box-office success. As a surprise to those expecting a sequel to Batman Begins, Mr. Nolan has instead produced a subtly staggering film about personal and professional rivalry between two magicians. The Prestige finds Mr. Nolan again in top form and re-teaming with his Batman Begins star, Christian Bale.The Prestige is an extremely complex film surrounding the conflict, jealousy and vengefulness that haunts two rival magicians. The story is told in a skewed timeline not unlike Memento. If anything, The Prestige's timeline is more intricate as the story shifts between several viewpoints and jumps around in time throughout the film. While this might sound confusing, this complex narrative never loses the viewer's attention or makes the movie less enjoyable. The multi-faceted approach instead pulled me in completely. It is one of my favorite films. As far as plot is concerned, I think it is best to omit most of The Prestige's details from this review as it relies heavily on numerous plot twists and surprises. I'd hate to ruin that for anyone. Suffice it to say, I found the subplot involving famed inventor Nikola Tesla to be a story-telling masterstroke. For those of you familiar with the inventions of Tesla, his involvement in the plot will be a definite highlight. It's also worthwhile to note that The Prestige has incredible replay value. This is a film that demands repeat viewings and delivers more surprises and depth with each look."
" One of the greatest ever.
",spoiler,"The Prestige is a fantastic film by far. Christopher Nolan has done many fantastic and awesome films. The Prestige is almost as good as The Dark Knight. The Prestige is on my favorites list as #2 because never before have I seen such magic. The Prestige is magic in many ways, either with magic or it's so good it's magic. I haven't seen such fantastic ways of story telling than Nolan's The Presige. The Dark knight has the same sort of theme. Also, his other great and awesome film Memento is very unique. The Prestige has a great cast including:Hugh Jackman(X-Men, Swordfish)Christian Bale(Equilibrium, The Dark Knight)Michael Caine(Sleuth, Miss Congeniality)Scarlett Johannson(He's just not that into you, The Other Boleyn Girl)David Bowie(Labryinth)Scarlett Johannson has a pattern with her film roles. In every film, she plays some sort of skank. In He's Just not that into you, Bradley Cooper's having an affair with her. In The Prestige, she dumps Hugh Jackman for Christian Bale. She has a good reason for that though. She doesn't play a skank in every film, but it sure as hell seems like it. The two main characters are Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. Personally, I prefer Alfred Bordan(Christian Bale). Bordan isn't as much of a prick as Angier(Hugh Jackman). The Prestige has a really clever ending and it definitely deserved the best film of 2006 award. It was only nominated for two Oscars. But it really deserved more because The Prestige is one of the greatest ever.The Plot: After a magic trick goes terribly wrong, two magicians become rivals. When one of them comes up with a fantastic new trick, the other tries to steal it."
" very good movie
",spoiler,"If there is already this kind of machine in the world but the scientists don't want to show it to us, then that is horrible. I don't think copying a person is as easy as copying a file on computer. However, it is possible. And we call the technology clone. So when some day you wake up and see a person who is just the same with you, what is your first feeling? Kill him/her or share your life with him/her? No matter what you choose, this person who is exactly you will disturb your normal life. So in some sense, if scientists have already found the technology for cloning people, they'd better not proclaim it. That's my opinion."
" Dark, moody, but fun!!!
",spoiler,"I really enjoyed this film and Christian Bale turns in yet another solid performance in Christopher Nolan's capable hands. I'll admit that it didn't take me very long to figure out most of the Jackman side of the plot but I freely admit that I never considered the 'twins' twist. I barely recognized Scarlett Johansson and Michael Caine did his usual seamless work.I was confused for a bit but when the story threads started to come together, I began to really get into it. The story was fascinating and David Bowie as Tesla was an inspired casting choice, adding just the right touch of murky mysteriousness. The sets were just awesome and the cinematography was spot on, conveying a dark but not oppressive mood. I usually judge a film by the impression that it leaves (or doesn't) on me hours or even days after viewing it, and this one had me running through all of the puzzle pieces in my mind for some time afterward. It was dark and somber but not enough to make one feel like it was a 'downer' experience. It did, however, leave me in a contemplative state of mind--and that's a good thing. This was a smartly written, solid piece of entertainment on all fronts.***-As a side note, I wish that Chris Nolan would get another sound designer---I'm sick of all of his movies having dialogue that you can barely hear, even with your sound system cranked up, only to have the next scene rattling the windows!***"
" An intelligent and entertaining film
",,"Over the past few years, there have been many movies which proved that is possible to combine both action and a good storyline. The Prestige is a clear example of that.Christopher Nolan has made a very good movie that doesn't get boring at any time, and keeps you awaiting for more. The script is great, and the acting doesn't disappoint. Christian Bale is definitely the one who gives the best performance. Nevertheless, the rest of the cast does a pretty good job as well. It gives a clear definition of what the world of magic is made off.If you haven't see it yet, I strongly recommend you to do so."
" interesting
",,"i came across this movie while while looking through shelves at the library.i overhead some woman talking about how great she thought it was so i thought i'd give it a try.the film was a lot different than i thought it would be,but that doesn't mean i didn't like it.the story kept you confused right up until the end. the characters we're developed rather well and you could feel the tension in a number of different scenes.i really wasn't expecting the movie to end the way it did,because,like a character thought,it was too easy.if you want a film that is entertaining with an original story-line and an allstar cast than look no further.the prestige is for you."
" Real Magic!
",spoiler,"The Prestige is significantly brilliant. From the tense acting to the beautiful directing, all the aspects exceed my expectations. Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Memento and The Dark Knight) continues to pursue brilliance. And quite literally has reached it. All of his films are of such perfection that no other director that i can think of could ever come close. His efforts in creating The Dark Knight for example are beyond anything i have ever seen before.Christian Bale (American Phyco) and Huge Jackman (X-Men)both play rival magicians. But when Alfred (Bale) performs the ultimate magic trick, his former friend turned enemy Robert (Jackman)tries to find the secret in the trick. Each twist and trick leaves the audience wanting more and when the credits roll you would feel like this film is deserving need of the best picture Oscar. And quite rightly so."
" An excellent movie to watch after ages............
",,"Well, what can i say, it was one of the best movies i ever watched. Christopher Nolan has always been one of my favorite Hollywood directors. I have always enjoyed all his movies, whether it was the memorable Memento or the beginning of the new chapter in Batman Begins. But over here, Nolan has managed to portray a fine movie despite making some changes to the original plot by Christopher Priest. Nolan has managed to pull out excellent performances from Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Michael Caine, as ever is, dependable on his role as the sidekick. The ending of the movie actually leaves the viewer gasping for more. I strongly suggest this movie for viewers to watch."
" Unusual
",spoiler,"The Prestige is an interesting and unusual movie, with a strong period feel and solid performances from the lead players.However, there are several elements which flaw the movie. One is Tesla's creation for Angier. Having as a Maguffin a machine which does something impossible not only negates the use of stage magic (based on deceptive illusions) as the centre around which the protagonists' rivalry is wound, it also takes the audience out of the movie and fatally weakens the first part of the denouement. Another flaw is Cutter's failure to act to rescue Borden from sentence of death once he discovers that Angier is not dead. Finally, and less importantly, David Bowie's accent as Tesla is a tad unconvincing.To compensate for this, Scarlett Johansson's mild estuary accent, complete with glottal stops, is excellent, pitched at a level where it falls short of blonde Essex girl.If The Prestige is ultimately less than 100% successful, it remains a worthwhile and entertaining movie nonetheless."
" One Of The Best Movies Every Made (PERIOD)
",,"I may be 16, but I have seen countless films and have a habit of forgetting the good ones and only retaining my memories of the not so good ones. But I cannot remember any film where I have been on the edge of my seat. With every scene, and the acting of the cast taking my breath away.With likes of ""Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, and a cameo from (DAVID BOWIE)"" on the bill you cannot fault this film. If there is any film that should be remembered for ever more, it should be this one. I doubt very much I will come across a film on par with this for many years.All I can say is take a couple of hours out and see this as you will be astonished !!!!!!!"
" The best film I have ever seen
",spoiler,"By far one of the best films I have ever seen in my life! This is a film you do not need to be a magician or even like magic for that matter to enjoy it secret's. Bale's performance was so powerful throughout the entire film, as well as Jackman's ETC. The most important part of a film is the ending, and the ending in The Prestige was 10 out of 10! I don't know about anyone else but after seeing it for my first time, I popped the DVD right back in and watched it again because I wanted to spot the difference's in the twin brothers. The first time viewing I was confused in scenes where Borden's personality changes throughout, so the second time gave me a whole different look! I also like the fact that you (the viewer) gets to decide certain things, there is not much that is spelled out for you.Anyway, A man's reach exceeds his imagination!"
" There is Beauty in Misdirection
",,"It is rare for Hollywood movies to engross a real adult in a film, but this one succeeds. Certainly there are magic tricks, but magic is really just the gimmick that allows this fascinating tale of an all-consuming competition for stage dominance between two master magicians to unfold.And there's more magic behind the individual amazing performances. Not only do the actors convince the audience of their sincerity in the performance of their role, but nearly every one is performing their role in a foreign accent. Hugh Jackman is Australian putting on a fine American sound. Christian Bale is Welsh providing an impressive London street sound.There will be a need to see the film a second time, to see how cleverly the screenplay was written. Beautiful work. The overall effect is that you are watching a mystery, romance, suspense movie all at once. Great costumes, beautiful look and feel to the piece. Fabulous acting. A really well-cast film masterfully achieved."
" Great Story, Great Acting, 10 Stars
",,"First of all it really has to be said that Christian Bale is a god amongst men, at least in front of a camera. He always seems to deliver an intense performance on an intense script, and I'm talking without fail. If you've seen American Psycho, Batman Begins, or Equilibrium will understand that Bale almost always ends up playing a serious and obsessive character. This movie is no exception. Bale portrays a magician who ends up in a serious and life threatening rivalry with another magician, played by Hugh Jackman. Now that wasn't a particularly compelling description but I really don't want to ruin anything for you. Hugh Jackman actually delivers an uncharacteristically good performance in this movie, he easily matched Bale. It really was perfect casting. So I haven't really described the storyline but that little sentence earlier is all I'm willing to say because this movie has an amazing twist which I don't want to ruin. All I will say is ""complete dedication to your art..."" 10 stars no question!"
" A magic dilemma
",spoiler,"It's a MUST SEE movie. In fact, this movie must be watched at least twice. It elicits enticing existential questions: the kind your brains just WANTS to figure out... A bit like the first time you try to imagine where the universe might end, what it looks like there and what comes next. If you watch the movie and don't get what I mean, just try to put yourself in the place of the magician going into his machine. Now decide which one you would be...and then, what comes next? The reason I say that you must watch it at least twice is that there are a set of events during the story where it becomes apparent that you have to work out which character was actually involved. The first viewing doesn't prepare you for the need to do that. Since I was passively watching the story the first time around, I didn't notice what was actually happening but I was uncomfortably confused from time to time. It is only with repeated viewings that you move towards a better understanding. And I still feel like I need to watch it again because I haven't yet quite figured out what happened in the end with respect to possible use of the machine. The nice thing is, you can figure out a couple of different possibilities and work through their significance. It's a lot of fun."
" A Fascinating Mystery
",spoiler,"Christopher Nolan's Memento didn't impress me, although I found the movie's structure interesting. Batman Begins downright disappointed me. Based on these two negative experiences I made the decision of not watching The Prestige when it came out in the theatres. I just knew I wouldn't like it.We all have mistakes we'd like to erase: The Prestige is my mistake. If I could go back in time and watch it on the big screen, I wouldn't think twice. I'd watch it twice actually! The Prestige is simply one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life. I saw it on a Monday and on Tuesday I was watching it again. As labyrinthine as the plot may be, it's never hard to follow (good screen writing and editing deserve credit for this), but you will want to watch it again because it's just too damn good! The Prestige follows the rivalry between Angier and Borden, two stage magicians at the end of the 19th century, as each one struggles to come up with the ultimate magic trick. Rivalry quickly becomes obsession, and deceit, kidnapping and murder become the means they use to reach their goals. Science also plays an unexpected role in this movie, which contributes to one of its more interesting twists. Yes, plural: there are at least 4 major twists in this movie. Too much? Trust me, the Nolan brothers know what they're doing.The cast is superb: we have the always excellent Michael Caine, Christian Bale, who's enjoying a renaissance in his career, Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson. The editing and cinematography are great. I love the art direction: the art crew brings 19th London to life, recreates the magic stages of the time, and speculates on how some of Tesla's inventions would look like.But what I really love in this movie is the screenplay. It might be light on character development, but this is first and foremost a mystery movie. The Nolan brothers do everything to delay giving information and keep suspense alive for as long as possible; they use flashbacks, they use an ingenious diary-within-diary narrative, voice-overs and just a lot of intelligent, and honest, misdirection. If you don't crack the mystery on your own, you have yourself to blame; the movie puts all the answers right in front of you.Watching The Prestige is a unique cinematic experience. It's everything I want from a movie. It's renewed my interest in the Nolans again and has made me anxious about The Dark Knight. If you want to have fun, watch this movie."
" the best movie from 2000-present and that is no lie
",,"i just saw this movie last night and let me tell you, this movie had me guessing the whole time because usually you could predict the plot of the move but not this time,twist over twist over twist... this is one of the few movies ever made the keep on shocking you, also the ending is probably better than any movie from 2000-present and no lie. some people say that there is no hero but once you see this movie, you will understand because greed, pride and obsession are the key factors so if you miss the movies that have a bang for your buck, this is will no doubt leave you wanting more action-10/10 plot-10/10 effects/visuals-10/10 overall- best movie in last 10 years (no lie)"
" Tesla
",spoiler,"A lot of people on the comments are complaining about how unrealistic it was to use Tesla as the inventor of the final trick. Well guys, I suggest you head over to Wikipedia, you'll find out that among the things Tesla was famous for was coming up with a number of outrageous theories. His being in the story fit in very well with the nature of the man himself. Some of his theories were just as mad as what is seen in the movie.Some other people are griping as to the unrealistic nature of the ending. Well, this isn't a drama, it's a horror film. The horror being the obsessive nature of the men involved, if you don't like it, I suggest you watch Sense and Sensibility or the Godfather.-ron"
" Magical ""the Prestige""
",,"For those who haven't seen ""the prestige"" yet, i can strongly recommend it to you.The Prestige follows a cleverly constructed story about two magicians,who become rivals, and will stop at nothing to triumph over the other.The movie builds up lots of tension, as both magicians try to harm or destroy the others ones life. I think it's better if you watch this movie with some friends, so that you can discuss your theory about why this and that happened, with them. The acting from hugh jackman and Christian bale couldn't be better.I like the dark and mysterious look of the film and that you don't really understand the whole story until the end. 10 stars for the prestige."
" A Wonderful, Wonderful, Wonderful movie!
",spoiler,"I didn't see this movie in the theaters,(which definitely adds to movies appeal) I saw it on a little TV, and was still blown away by it. I had just seen the Illusionist, and wasn't so sure that I would enjoy another ""magic"" movie. I was so wrong. I really enjoyed The Illusionist, but The Prestige topped it. I was astounded. The Acting is superb. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine are very very good. The plot, though at times confusing, is wonderfully rich with detail, and very imaginative. This is such a good movie that I could watch three million times in a row, if I was inclined to do so. It is one of those movies that keeps you guessing until the very end, in the revealing scene, where you finally find out Borden's secret, really using a double, which I definitely did not see coming. This movie is a work of art, and I thoroughly enjoyed. This is an A-list movie, with an All-star acting,and one you shouldn't miss!"
" 'Apracadabra'
",,"Where do I begin...this movie is definitely one of my favorite top five films. Christopher Nolan directed this perfectly. When I first saw this on DVD I was just blown away. All the actors were outstanding in this film. The plot and story is really good. I was just sitting there watching with a grin on my face thinking in the back of my head: ""This is a good film"". I think that a portion of my fondness towards this film may be because that when I was watching it, the power went out and that just built up the suspense.Overall. This film is a must see.10/10"
" The prestige is magic trick on the audience
",spoiler,This is not just a movie about magic. the best part is he makes the film itself like a magic trick.the screenplay is organised in a way like a magic trick.IE he keeps creating situations where each time the audience gets to suspicion & at last he pulls out the rabbit over the other end.similar to memento where we understood the 15 min memory loss like experiencing itself thanks to the order of the screenplay.similarly we end up her being the magician's audience rather than the film's audience.i tell you. u got to watch intensely to know the way the director has carried the audience. when u do not understand the situations & not encourage your doubts you might only end your experience as partly logical & one supernatural portion of the film.i might not have been impressed if it were a linear screenplay.like i said the non linear magic trick fitted the story like jigsaw.if u take a suspense film.u got to be a genius if at the end of the day the audience end up satisfied by the suspense itself more than the end disclosure itself. i came to a situation where i could accept anything supernatural in the plot of a perfectly logical film.now that was a fact not all would approve of.u can have a dozen way of criticizing but what matters is how uve been carried into the film & how good u feel about it even before its end & even a normal supposed to be spoiler supernatural end only make you feel not any less good.lots of contradictions & irony in this film eg.eg.magician's life is about simple day today logical tricks while science produces the real magic.but the best part is the way he displayed the one superficial part of the film which is logically supposed to be a spoiler considering the other strong logics of the film. he built the suspense so much that at the time of revealing the mystery the audience is already into his hands & it doesn't matter how it ends & the best logical way to end the magical suspense is a real supernatural thing itself.we grow too accustomed to appreciating logic behind a magic trick that at the end the we are inclined to appreciate the supernatural.& what more once again like a magic trick the real magic of story was not in angers disclosure but of Borden's secret which we & the characters could have guessed several times but only end up stupefied by this. i was more surprised of burdens secret than angers. i appreciated a supernatural plot while i was stupefied by a logical reasoning of burdens.now that is real magic & cinematic genius.Jonathon Nolan has his strength in screenplay.now he has chosen topics which complement this non linear screenplay. now this is a team that is genius. i tell you. u got to watch intensely to know the way the director has carried the audience because not understanding the situations & not encouraging the doubts might only end your experience as partly logical & one supernatural aspect of the film.
" Movie Magic
",spoiler,"I went into this with somewhat low expectations since I really didn't care much for Nolan and Bale's collaboration on ""Batman Begins"" and I haven't seen anything else by Nolan. I guess I heard some good things about it, plus it was about magicians and my girlfriend will watch anything with David Bowie. Well, I was pretty much floored because it's one of the most enjoyable and intriguing films I've seen in the last few years. With the exception of Johansson who doesn't seem to know what to do with her role, every performance was memorable. Bale finally convinced me that he's a leading man, Jackman was for once as good as his talent would make you think he should be, and it was especially refreshing to see Bowie and Michael Caine in a movie that's actually good for a change. The direction is very stylish but at the same time always appropriate. The twin diary narrative really serves the film well. I always love that moment when the story catches up to the narrator and you never really know if the narrator has all the clues up to that point. When the movie reaches the point where the narration began (in this case, the trip to Colorado to find Tesla), a whole new set of possibilities is opened up and it's almost like you can start the movie all over again.I have to give it some more time to set in but I'm excited about watching it again because there are so many lines and even whole scenes that take on a different meaning once the conclusion is known. Some of the things that felt pretty weak the first time around (i.e. ""I loved you yesterday"") could become either poignant or at least ironic. Some things that felt strong already (i.e. ""nobody cares about the man in the box"") become disturbingly resonant.I love movies that are able to entertain with a narrative and at the same time suggest themes about film itself or entertainment in general that mirror the story. This is really one of the better recent examples of this type of writing  the whole film fulfills the model of the magician and the 3 moments in a magic trick. The film presents us with some situations that seem mundane (the relationship with wife and mistress, Angiers' obsession with the Transported Man trick), then it ""turns"" and makes these mundane relationships feel bizarre and twisted (and possibly unreal) only to deliver a superb ""prestige"" in the end which makes us realize that there IS emotional truth in these characters despite the more bizarre aspects of their character development. Perhaps the only serious flaw in the film is that the process takes so long to unravel that the audience has already decided long before the end that they don't like either of these characters  you can only sit in the darkened theater afterwards to ponder whether perhaps one of these two brothers wasn't quite as bad as the other.""Are you watching closely?""  in terms of meaning, it could just as easily have been a command: ""Watch closely."" But I think that would describe a different, and less polemical, movie. I think it was written as a question because this movie really seeks to engage the audience, not just to blow us away with effects, acting, story revelations, but to make us think about what we're seeing, to be constantly questioning what the film seems to expect us to believe. The magic trick won't even work without the audience's willing participation in the larger scheme of mystery and revelation. So I'm slightly surprised that so many posters here as well as intelligent film critics like Roger Ebert seem to consider the steampunkish sci-fi elements associated with the Tesla character to be out of place or even a betrayal of the audience's faith. I felt from the very first moments of the film that there were really no rules about where the story could take us. And frankly, it's a cool idea and it adds a lot of wonder and amazement to the story's conclusion. Sure, the film may not qualify as ""high fantasy"" or even perhaps as science fiction (since there's no likely explanation in sight as to why the device should work other than Tesla's reputation and the mystique he was given by the director and writers), but I think there's no real reason why a fantasy element can't be introduced late in the story and that the entire framework should adequately prepare the viewer to accept the possibility of Tesla's device working since the Tesla element is one of the first explored at least initially in the narrative despite taking place later in the sequence of events. Bowie and Serkis are fantastic as a pair of modern-day wizards, and the whole idea of using Edison's men as villains is priceless and will striek anyone who knows early cinema history as very true. People in general might not know about how brutal Edison's goons were when they enforced his patents and crushed his competitors; Edison's own self-aggrandizing behavior still skews our picture of him to this day. This movie is a great bit of overdue payback on behalf of Tesla from Hollywood, a town founded by people escaping Edison's goons but who later helped to create his myth through film."
" Complexity at its Best
",spoiler,"The Prestige is a highly rich and complex linear narrative that contains many non-conventional elements throughout its storyline. It is compact with multiple themes and motifs that cue the viewer to suspend disbelief, acquire poetic faith, engage in mind-boggling inquiry, and become active participants in determining what is ethical. It is a story that centers upon the darkness of magic. The explicit query, ""Are you watching closely?"" provides a profound subtext throughout the film in asking the following: What is real and what is illusion? Examining the nature of self-sacrifice and to what extent its meaning is skewed is another common question asked. It effectively manipulates the viewer's emotions in providing no real protagonist but rather invites them to carefully consider there own heroism. What is meant by this is that the viewer is given a choice after seeing what dire consequences fall upon the lead antagonists of the piece. The choice is the following: Either you walk away feeling bitter about the unethical values these two characters held, or, you obtain a heroic and metaphorical textbook on how not to act when offenses come into your life. This is the predominant theme of the film: Although offenses will come, suspend what you consider unethical in other's views by allowing tolerance to teach you a lesson on how not to react when feelings are injured. In following the traditional aristocratic method of storytelling, The Prestige examines the lives of two skilled magicians whose hearts lack forgiveness and whose obsessions with becoming the ""greatest magicians of all time"" thwart their opportunities to be happy. In an ongoing battle of jealousy, envy and meticulous revenge, the two men become slaves to their illusions and end up sacrificing what's most important to themtheir lives; their families. The editing of this film is rather non-conventional and illusory. In support of the subject of magic, it eludes both time and space to create an off-set, spatial and temporal ambiguity. The viewer is constantly thrust between past, present and future settings through the use of journals being read, stories being told, and first-person narrations of both antagonists. The effect of this parallel editing is used to keep the viewer on his/her feet in determining what is real and what is not. Director Christopher Nolan made some rather poignant directing choices during the process of analyzing, interpreting and conceptualizing the piece. One particular choice is of choosing the concept of magic to examine the many avenues (both metaphysical and transcendental) of deceit amongst the characters. One such avenue is of deceiving the viewer on what type of genre the film is. Upon entering the theater, the viewer most likely suspends disbelief to the psychological thriller or drama genre, little knowing that half-way through the film it will become a science-fiction piece. The reason this works and why the viewer ought not to feel disappointment by its ""unrealistic"" qualities is that the film itself is based upon the idea of magic being a form of enchantment and illusion. Nolan is able to get away with switching the genre for this very reason. However, this is the only reason. If the film were to contemplate any other theme than magic, it most likely would not work. It's as if Nolan is performing his own prestige over the viewer's assumptions and parading their expectations with suspense and surprise. Like the characters in his film, Nolan too has sacrificed much in making this film. Any film as complexly deep and rich as this one is had to have been extremely well thought out and prepared for. The choice of setting the story in the early 1900's reflects the beginning of the post-modernist and film phenomenological eraone which has no fixed meaning other than what the viewer brings to it. It's completely fitting for a story as ambivalent and open-ended as this one is where meaning can literally be derived from anywhere."
" Awesome, amazing film
",,"this is a superb film, brilliant script, wonderful costumes and sets, and powerful dialog's, to top that an amazing plot, which is an illusion in itself. makes you feel in the end. I had heard negative reviews in about this film, until I watched it and the whole trick is in the movie itself, it makes you ponder, thats a genius script, as in the movie, the theme is elaborated that the audience knows the trick but how you perform it is what matters.Over the top performance by Christian Bale, and Jackman, both crafty, both, obsessive, both, lonely and both miserable. thats the price of the trick.I think this movie ranks at a justified spot. the twist in the end makes it look fake, and gives us something to doubt, which is altogether an essence of the craft itself.A brilliant movie, do watch it, highly recommended to anyone who enjoys, off the hook stories and superb performances."
" It makes you want to see what happens next
",,"This movie kept me paying absolute attention to every dialog, every new thing that come up, and it made me guess ""What's next?"" every time, and what's most fulfilling about the movie, is that in the end, it answers all questions and leave you without doubts about reasons and motives. In other words, it has no holes, and that was my sensation in the end, that it created lots of questions that I wanted the answer, and it answered properlyThe story is very original, and the way it is passed to the spectator is also interesting, different and original. It really had a good effect on me.When I saw the trailer, I expected something totally different from what I've saw."
" Finely structured complexity
",,"Starring Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Andy Serkis, Piper Perabo, and David Bowie (as Nikola Tesla). Well you thought ""The Sixth Sense"" had twists and turns? Not compared to this one! It's the late 1800's. The next generation of stage magicians is coming  and they are VERY competitive. Two are near the top, and keep trying to out-do the other for top position. Then things get out of control. This is SO much fun, and the complexity is so finely structured, you finally just sit back and let yourself go for the ride. Think roller coaster that keeps shooting past the starting gate for another loop. ""The Prestige"" has a sub-story, and that is of the inventor Nikola Tesla, whose biography I recently read. You will enjoy knowing that ALL the inventions and events depicted for Tesla were TRUE  until you get to the final secret related to the top hats. That's all I'll say. This was an exhilarating cat-n-mouse-n-mouse-n-cat-n-mouse story."
" Story-telling at its finest
",,"Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale star as a pair of young, up-and-coming magicians who start out as friends, but eventually become the bitterest of rivals with each man obsessed with finding out the other's methods.What amazes me is just how well told the story is. It pulls you in with the opening scene and just doesn't let go. The film doesn't follow a linear path. Instead, it starts off by providing a glimpse of film's final stages and then goes back and fills you in on what happened to arrive at that point. The film frequently jumps between different time periods, in some places juggling three time periods at once, but it's done so well that it's never confusing about where you are in the story.The subject matter deals with magicians and their methods for tricking audiences. What really makes it interesting is that the film is put together like a giant magic trick. When you reach the end, everything just falls into place and fits perfectly. Repeat viewings don't detract from the movie at all. Rather, they simply add more depth to the overall story. You gain a greater appreciation for the acting and story-telling and are more aware of how the film's props hint at the story's eventual outcome.The performances are fantastic all around. Hugh Jackman gives a noteworthy performance as Robert Angier, an originally decent man who has allowed himself to become twisted with hate and obsession with learning fellow magician Alfred Borden's tricks. Christian Bale delivers a top notch performance as Borden, the target of Angier's obsession. The excellence of Bale's performance isn't as immediately obvious, but during repeat viewings subtleties and nuances of his performance that are tough to spot the first time become more obvious. Lastly, Michael Caine is excellent in a supporting role.All told, this is just one fantastically made movie. Highly recommended. 9/10"
" Best movie of 2007
",spoiler,"This is the best movie that I've seen for quite some time. The story is so brilliant written, specially because Nolan builds upon the mystical inventions of Tesla, greed and over achievement and the plot is just brilliant even in it's obviousness. To be honest I thought the Bordens were twins because Christian Bale's character(s) have slightly different accents and to confirm it I got the DVD and played it and listened very carefully and you can here that one character has a bit more of a cockney accent than the other. Also then the whole ""finger ordeal"", the one little line that Borden's wife says: ""It looks like it's the same as it happens"" falls into place. The movie is great when you see it the first time and even more enjoyable when you see it the second time, because you know the plot and you start to pay attention to all the other little details.Christian Bale plays a terrific role but also Hugh Jackman is not to be forgotten, the way how he plays the frustration not able to figure out how Alfred Borden does the transported man trick is so vivid.The Nolans have proved to be some of the best screen writers and Christopher Nolan one of the best directors. If you don't believe me watch this movie and Batman Begins and you know what I mean. I like the way that Nolan likes to film out of the hand (specially in this film), so shots are very dynamic and contain a lot of movement without having to force your dinner down unlike for instance Transformers. This motion of the camera around the actors really add to the whole mystique around the two main characters.And a special not for Michael Caine who has always been one of my favorite actors and his character is so crucial to this film but he remains on the background as an engineer. I think it's superb who a grand actor like him can do this.Two thumbs up for this movie!"
" Frightening about human nature
",,"This film is powerful, moving, and shocking. It shows what happens when people are suffering, and do not know how to handle their suffering in ways that do not hurt others. What begins as a friendship, then becomes a competition, eventually turns into a maddening and psychotic race to defeat another person and to destroy the other person's entire existence. In doing so, it dehumanizes everyone involved, and is frightening in terms of what it says about our inability to contain our pain. Saul Bellow once said something to the effect that an honorable man is one who does not pass his hurts along to others. These people fail to be honorable, with tragic results. And yet, they are not evil.The storyline, setting, and acting are all superb. David Bowie as Nicolai Tesla is masterful casting. This may be the only filming of this brilliant man, someone who changed civilization, yet was the participant in his own self-destructive competition with someone less talented who we all know, although only because he won the ""competition,"" not because he was more talented or important.This movie, like few others, stays with you. Months after seeing it, I still am affected by it. Ignore the critics. See it."
" a mind bender
",,"Christoper Nolan impressed me with Batman Begins,and more so with this movie,i believe we have a new great director and writer,not to mention the outstanding talents of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman,needless to say,MIchael Caine and David Bowie turn in outstanding performances,Mr. Nolan,I salute you,i will be thrilled to see real movie making for a change,excellent.i was just informed that my comment is not long enough,i do not know what else to say,enjoyment of this movie and the twisting plots and surprises are truly mind benders,and i forgot to mention the lovely Scarlett Johanson,i would walk on 10 miles of broken glass to give her a hug,she is a visual delight in every sense of the word.On a technical note,the editing and cinematography were excellent,and the script is something to behold,keep up the good work Mr.Nolan and no doubt there is a bright star shining for Christian Bale,he has been outstanding since the Spielberg classic,Empire of The Sun,i love the way he toys with accents,a great deal of talent there"
" Better the Second Time Around
",spoiler,"The first time I saw this film, I was somewhat disappointed with it. The imagery is quite beautiful throughout, and I enjoyed the bits where they revealed how certain magical tricks worked (the bird vanishing/reappearing trick was particularly good). These scenes do a very good job of showing you how everything is an illusion, and you need to figure out what's going on behind the scenes (which seems to be the obsession of both magicians, played ably by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman). But I focused a bit too much on that aspect of it and was disappointed with one aspect of the latter half, where all rational/realistic explanation fails and the movie becomes somewhat fantastic. This, I felt, compromised the earlier promise of the movie to reveal how everything was simply an illusion that could be explained by ordinary means.The second time I saw the film, however, I appreciated it significantly more. Instead of viewing the movie as a story about how two men are constantly trying to outdo each other by building progressively more complex illusions, I saw it as a cautionary tale about obsession (a motif which I put on the back-burner the first time around since its full impact doesn't hit until the very end of the film). The lengths to which BOTH of the men go to achieve their art is thrilling and terrifying--and in this light, the movie is an engaging success."
" ""Prestige"" has amazing twists, amazing reveal
",,"What makes ""The Prestige"" so different from other films is that the storyline is so fresh and original. So many times we have seen stories about a secret agent on the run or superheroes saving the world. But the Prestige concerns two magicians obsessed with mastering the new arts of magic tricks, and their obsession, even to the death, to figure them out before the other.Christopher Nolan's film-noir style brings a very brooding and ominous feel to the film, which in the end, turns out to be very deathly and the audience realizes that the climax has been met by a series of lies.Yet, when you feel like you understand what is happening in the plot, either a twist occurs or you reach the end of the film realizing that much that has happened was a lie anyway. This may be an ambiguous way to describe the events of ""The Prestige-"" but this is indeed the way the movie goes, until you are left at the end full of additional questions that you thought you already had the answer to- and want to see it again as soon as possible! 4/4 stars"
" Observation that irks me but still a great film
",spoiler,"The Prestige is a very good movie and I have watched it several times. I found the acting, rivalry and drama to be superb. However having read biographies of the Great Man Tesla and I would recommend you do as well, as he was the father of AC current, robotics and radio, and led the life of an obsessive compulsive Genius, giving his patents away to Westinghouse, ruined financially in the end. My difficulty with the end of this movie is one of knowledge. Tesla creates a machine that can duplicate animal or thing, yet does not possess the foresight to duplicate the thing he needs the most, the financial ability to become independent, by replicating the money he needs so much and to turn his dreams into reality. I understand this is just a movie and all movies have flaws but this one slip spoils it for me somewhat but it is still worth the watch."
" Fascinating film with plenty of suspense, humour, mystery and a little of science fiction throw in this intriguing story.
",,"Near the end of the 19th century in London. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackson), his wife Julia (Piper Perabo) and their friend Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are assistants to a magician (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Michael Caine). When Julia accidentally dies during an performance. Robert blames on his friend Alfred and they become enemies. Both of them have become famous for different reasons and they are always trying to out smart each other on their new tricks. Alfred becomes much more successful with his tricks and always doing much better than Robert. Robert becomes obsessed on trying to find out how Alfred's secret tricks. Both risk everything to be the greatest magician, while there's full of lies and sabotage between the two. But nothing what it seems between these new magicians, while one of them might have to face tragic consequences.Directed by Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins, Insomnia ""2002"", Memento) made an entertaining, suspenseful, mystery film with plenty of humour with unsuspecting plot twists. Nolan brings many intriguing visual style with drama as well. Jackman, Bale and Caine are excellent in this picture. Which it is somewhat underrated, when it was released last year in theaters. This movie has an fine supporting cast like Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie, Andy Serkis and Roger Rees.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong-Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an featurette and an photo gallery. This DVD could have used more features like an audio commentary track by the filmmakers, deleted scenes, outtakes and an full length documentary. But it will be probably for an future DVD release. This film received two Oscar nominations like Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. This ingenious picture will play well on DVD and this have an major cult following as well. Nolan is certainly one of the most gifted filmmakers of the 21th century and plenty of good films from his to come in the near future. Don't miss it.

" ""Are you watching closely?""
",spoiler,"A good suspense film is very much like a magician's trick: we have absolutely no idea where this remarkable lead-up is taking us, and the final revelation is so mind-blowing that, after the curtains come down, we find ourselves stumbling from the theatre in a delightful daze of exhilaration and satisfaction. Already, we are arguing with the person who was sitting beside us: how was it all accomplished? One by one, most of the pieces slowly fall into place, but the film/magician still retain a sense of mystery, of wonder, of magic. Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' is precisely this sort of film. In the grand scheme of things, it is something of a nonentity, destined to become neither significant nor influential; however, it is such a invigorating thrill-ride that you get the sense that it is the promise of films like this that is the very reason we go to the cinema.Having already established his reputation as the director of 'Memento' and 'Batman Begins,' Christopher Nolan here cements his place as one of Hollywood's most exciting talents. 'The Prestige,' a riveting tale of magician rivalry, is set in England at the turn of the 20th century (much like its contemporary, Neil Burger's excellent 'The Illusionist') and stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in top-form. It was adapted from Christopher Priest's successful 1995 novel of the same name, with the screenplay penned by the director and his brother Jonathon Nolan, who, once again, employ the use of their favoured non-linear narrative structure. The title refers to the third of three fictional components of a typical magic trick, as outlined in Priest's story: The Pledge (""The magician shows you something ordinary""), The Turn (""The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary"") and, finally, The Prestige (""making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige."").Christian Bale plays Alfred Borden, an ambitious budding magician who is willing to sacrifice everything to become the greatest of all time. Hugh Jackman is Robert Angier, a born showman, who tragically lost is wife (Piper Perabo) during a failed underwater predicament escape, an accident for which he blames Borden. As the two magicians part ways for separate careers, Angier bitterly despises that Borden has formed a family and found happiness, and their professional and personal rivalry only intensifies when Borden pulls off ""the greatest magic trick ever seen,"" known as The Transported Man. Desperate to upstage his competitor, Angier travels across the world to try and duplicate Borden's trick, his search leading him to the remote American laboratory of physicist Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), whose work with Alternating Current electricity has spawned an invention of staggering capabilities.Aside from the passionate performances of its two leads, 'The Prestige' is also held together by numerous supporting roles of varying quality. Michael Caine is excellent as Cutter, the aging mentor whose experience and wisdom helps Angier on numerous occasions, though Angier's decision to neglect his old friend's confidence ultimately leads to his own downfall. Scarlett Johansson is competent as Olivia Wenscombe, the stage assistant who becomes the love interest of both rivals at some point during the film. The role was hardly a demanding one, basically requiring the actress to be on screen and to look glamorous; but, all things considered, she does this very well. David Bowie, rather strangely, has a riveting on screen presence as the real-life inventor Nikola Tesla, and Andy Serkis is enjoyable to watch as Tesla's assistant, Alley. Additionally, Rebecca Hall is pretty good as Borden's wife, Sarah, who is driven into depression by her husband's alternating personality and fierce dedication towards his work.The competition between the two magicians is absolutely thrilling to watch, as each continues to sabotage the other's work, in a grim and futile attempt to gain the upper hand. Obsession is one of the film's dominant themes, with Angier eventually becoming so dangerously infatuated with Borden's magic trick that he loses everything and everyone he cares about. Borden, meanwhile, also loses much that he loves, a sacrifice he is seemingly more-than-willing to make, though he is eventually given the opportunity to redeem himself. Mirroring this bitter antagonism is the rivalry between Tesla and (an unseen) Thomas Edison, with the latter  an advocate of DC electricity  taking numerous drastic steps to destroy the AC electricity experiments of his contemporary. Though largely grounded firmly in reality, 'The Prestige' takes a science-fiction turn in its climax, which may prove something of a cop-out for some, but will delight those who are enthusiastic about the genre.'The Prestige' is a film with numerous twists to always keep you thinking, and, like a good magic trick, you'll be talking about it for hours after the show is over. Having watched the film a second time, I was pleased to find that the story (which has been described by some to be merely ""gimmicky"") holds up well on multiple viewing. Another interesting thing to note is that the hints towards the final twist are certainly there in full-view for you to notice the only thing is, you won't notice them. Why? Because, of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled."
" An interesting story well told
",,"It attracts you at first because it treats a subject everyone likes: magic and its secrets. But then, from the start, you see the plot quickly thicken. Writer and director Christopher Nolan, who has already proved his brilliance with Memento, plays with the timing of the story yet again by skillfully shuffling four different periods in the storyline, and adds an exciting pace by revealing a new twist with every step, so you never get used to anything or bored. The performances are dead-on and the actors very well cast indeed. A little too long, but it pays to see it all through. You want to have some fun? Try to figure out what happens next. The movie will by far exceed your expectations. Very entertaining indeed.By the way, Tesla existed in real life, though I seriously doubt he built all the things shown in the movie."
" Wonderfully intricate story makes this one a winner
",,"Once you get all the twists and turns of the plot sorted out in your head (and doing so will undoubtedly require multiple viewings) only then will you really be able to appreciate just how brilliantly conceived the story in The Prestige is. Going back to their earlier film, Memento, writer/director Christopher Nolan, along with his co-writer and brother Jonathan, have shown a unique talent for creating mind-bending, thought-provoking films which leave you wanting to see them again and again to unravel all the story's mysteries. The Prestige may not quite be up to the level of Memento but it certainly stands in its own right as another superior effort by the brothers Nolan.Probably the less said about the plot here the better. Better to allow you to unravel the story yourself. The basics...the story follows two magicians performing in Europe circa 1900. Initially friends they will soon become bitter rivals in a tale of true obsession. As presented in the film, the story jumps around in time which is a key piece of what in the end is a masterfully constructed puzzle. Because of the skewed time line, at times we know more than the characters and at other times we know less. It makes it all the more enjoyable when all the various story lines and time lines converge and finally we, and the film's characters, finally know the whole story.As one might imagine just by looking at the cast list The Prestige is filled with tremendous performances. As the two key magicians Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both do a wonderful job of bringing their respective characters to life. Bale is perfect as the quiet, dark and brooding Alfred Borden while Jackman is similarly spot-on as the more showy and ultimately obsessive Robert Angier. Michael Caine is reliably brilliant in his supporting role as magician's assistant Cutter, inventor of illusions. Scarlett Johansson plays a stage assistant and while her role requires her to do little more than look pretty she is certainly up to that task and makes the most of what opportunities the script provides her. Everyone else in the wide and varied cast falls into their roles well, including David Bowie whose appearance as a brilliant scientist screams out ""stunt casting!"" but who performs his part wonderfully and fits right in with the rest of this terrific ensemble. A truly great cast really brings this story to life.While the story is beautifully crafted the one minor quibble one may have is that this story doesn't have quite as much heart as say, The Illusionist, that other circa 1900 European magicians movie to come out in 2006. The Prestige no doubt has a better story, much more involved and complex. But while you can appreciate the story in The Prestige you may find it much more easy to embrace the story in The Illusionist. It's a subtle difference. Both films are tremendously well done and definitely well worth your while. If you're looking for a terrific story, one that will make you think, one that is ultimately surprising and thrilling, you will find few films which fit that bill better than The Prestige."
" Scarlett Johannson, Michael Caine, and yes, David Bowie.what more could you want?
",,"Scarlett Johannson, Michael Caine, and yes, David Bowie.what more could you want? 'The Prestige' is suspenseful, with a great cameo by a surprise actor, and sub-plots that make you watch the movie five times before putting it all together. Yes, what is better than David Bowie himself being the genius scientist? Well as good as Bowie may be, incredibly enough, a lot in this movie surpasses even him.Magicians Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are co-workers in their young careers working for manager Cuter (Michael Caine). The two end up being enemies after a piece of magic turns fatal. Angier and Borden then battle to become Britain's best magician while constantly trumping each other. The film shows that the human drive to be the best is enough to drive man to obsession, but only after throwing everything important away.'The Prestige' comes from simple terminology used by magicians. As Cutter explains early in the film, there are three parts to a magic trick. The third is the prestige, which is making the object re-appear. The curiosity of the prestige of the great 'Transported Man' trick is what carries the viewers' attention throughout the film, and eventually it awes all in the conclusion.This film is a wonderful science fiction mystery that can make anyone believe that all events in this film are or were humanly possible. The setting is the turn of the twentieth century in Great Britain. Dark colored clothes and low-key dark lighting are used to set the tone of the film. Many shots are taken under stage, in dark dressing rooms, in bedrooms at night, in prison cells, in cemeteries, in secluded forests, and in dark allies. All the foreshadowing of darkness that dawns upon all the main characters involved, from the headlining magicians down to the scientist secluded on a mountainside.The dark colors and close facial shots are very reminiscent of Ron Howard's 'A Beautiful Mind'. Both flicks have a wonderful ability to hold movie-goers' attention and make them debate the possible outcomes up until the end of the film and even after viewing.The magicians show that the human drive to be the best is enough to drive them to obsession, but only after throwing everything important away. See for yourself what the consequences are of these decisions."
" wow
",,"now now now Mr. Nolan is the master director of these times is not an unknown thing. anyone doubts it pls watch prestige. watch it again and watch it again, try to find faults if u can, there are none. the performances are goood very gooood. Hugh Jackman and Christian bale just kick ass and convince you that they are the characters. the beauty of this movie is the script. the camera work is so cool and profound that you will feel that you are in every frame of the movie, right there watching it happen in front of you. it does get a bit slow in the middle but the end makes up for it this movie talks about rivalry gone wrong wholly wrong. rivalry is good but once it comes to the stage of rivalry Jackman and Bale have in this movie u just know something bad is gonna happen and shows what competition can do to completely normal people. flawless and wow mazing it will leave u stunned this is one film, after watching i was left stunned, never has a movie done that to me. the end will just take u by surprise and make you hail Nolan as the king of the present age. watch it."
" totally surprised
",spoiler,"I am not sure why this is so how on the all time list, but this was an extremely entertaining film. There is not much to say that this is an extremely entertaining film, that does everything right. With all of the twists most of which I did not see coming. I had a feeling about the twin, but not 100% percent sure. Since Cutter was a character outside of the movie I was sure he was right about the body double and that could only be achieved by his brother, but as a viewer I wanted to believe that part was magic. I just read a few arguments that people have about the movie and I try to instigate discussions at the end of movies (like I like to do with Pan's Labrynth), but I think this movie really did a good job of remember that this was just a movie and listening to Christopher Nolan's commentary on the making of the film, but tells me that the whole point of this movie was to trick the viewer into believing what we saw was real, not because we actually believe, but because we want to. I think the end with Jackman's character was unnecessary and conflicted with the character and it should have been left that Bale's character was not only the better magician, but the better human being. The performances were great especially Caine's. The accent's slipped a few times on the main characters, but still over all a great 2 hours of my life. I really was on the edge of my seat the entire time. This is one of the few movies, where the director succeeds in creating a world that as a viewer I wanted to believe in."
" Watching closely?
",spoiler,"Hugh Jackman has come a long way. So has Christian Bale. Their acting talents are clearly on show in this awesome film.The Prestige is about two rivals magicians trying to better one another with a series of tricks that will lead to a fight for the final, ultimate trick. A trick they will be remembered for. It follows Hugh Jackman (Angiers) as he tries to understand how on earth his nemesis Christian Bale (Boarden) has created the 'best trick he has ever seen.' - The Transported Man... He desperately tries to imitate it, but can never seem to get it right... And soon it becomes clear that he will go to alarming lengths to find the secret...An amazing storyline, a powerful unique plot. An ending with amazing twists to die for. Realistic, dramatic performances from an outstanding cast... Including support from Scarlett Johanssen, David Bowie and the superb Michael Caine as Cutter... I really enjoyed this film...My favourite bit... May spoil it a little...Angiers has completed his diabolical scheme to defeat his rival... And Michael Caine confronts him. Before an amazing twist in the story comes, watch closely... Or you'll never spot it...They talk--- Cutter: Remember I told you what the sailor said about drowning? Angiers: He said it was like going home... Cutter: I lied. He said, it was agony.As dramatic as Brando's taxi scene and as conclusive to this film as I think you could get... Except of course for the brilliant twist that follows... Of course... You may know what I mean by this if you've seen it, and if not then oh well. Look closer next time...I highly rate this film, and only a little common sense in me has refrained me from giving it a 10/10 - Although it may deserve such a rating... Who knows? Tra."
" A well written, entertaining and well acted film
",,"When I first saw the DVD cover for this film I was immediately drawn to buying it due to a combination of factors; Christopher Nolan to me is a great director with Momento a piece of art as far as I am concerned. I also consider Batman Begins to be the best of all the Batman films so far, maybe even the best comic book film so far. Christian Bale I also consider to be a fine actor and almost all his performances so far (which I have seen) have been the best I have seen for his age.I was not disappointed, my high expectations were met and at no point during the film did I become bored, the story moved along swiftly and the film did not rely on stereotypical portrayals of the period, Nolan actually made the period feel fresh.Christian Bale as usual gives a stellar performance and Jackman holds his weight as the supporting lead. I was not entirely convinced by Scarlett Johannson as she seemed quite wooden (and pouts her way through the film) in a role that relied on her looks, a special mention should go to David Bowie who was excellent and will hopefully appear in more serious acting roles.Overall greatly entertaining, not too confusing and deeply engaging."
" An incredible movie
",,"This is the best film i have ever seen. It's simply awesome! When i was watching this film, i couldn't stop myself, even i wanted to go to the loo. There's no doubt that everyone will love this film.""Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it because you're not really looking. You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled. "" I love this sentence very much, it includes all the summary and plot in this movie. There's a lot of twists and turns, you can't believe what you've seen, the answers are always different to what you've think of...."
" Very good film - but need to pay attention!!! :-)
",,"I saw this film on DVD with a few friends, one of which saw it in the cinema and thought it was the most amazing film ever!! One tip - don't watch with a friend who has seen it before and thought it was absolutely fantastic - ruins it a bit!! LOL! But, all that aside, it was a brilliant film - not as good as she was making it out to be but an overall good film. It is one that definitely needs the full attention of watchers as you can get confused easily but it's a film that everyone can enjoy really. Even David Bowie fans!! He was pretty good with his accent - reminds me of his song China Girl! It's a proper ""expect the unexpected"" film - don't want to spoil it for you so I'll leave it there. If you don't like complicated films then I wouldn't watch it but it is a must-see-before-you-die (sorry for the negative!!). It has action, romance, slight horror as well - a proper thriller!"
" I Liked It But...
",spoiler,"Maybe I missed something (possible) and maybe I'm putting too much onto my innate sense of justice, but I was left severely wanting after this movie ended. Chrisian Bale's character was ultimately responsible for the first fatal stab against his rival by tying the wrong knot on the wife of Hugh Jackman's character, resulting in her death. This act, followed by the Christian Bale's character initial sabotoge of the other's stage shows, seems to warrant that he'd be the one who ends up paying for the injustices in the end. Yet he doesn't, and in fact he wins in the end. Hugh Jackman is the one who loses and Christian Bale wins, and with the assistance of the Michael Caine character. Someone tell me what I'm missing here..."
" One of the best
",,"Wow. I heard from this movie right after I heard Edward Norton was doing The Illusionist. As a huge fan of magicians, Edward Norton and Hugh Jackman my day couldn't possibly be better. I just had to see these movies.First I watched the Illusionist. It was completely different than what I expected, but it was quite a nice movie. The Prestige however was totally as I expected and was absolutely perfect. The atmosphere it created was just wonderful.The plot twists this movie has are just genius. Every time you think you understand whats happening, the plot twists and you have to think it all over again. That's, I think, the strength of this movie.The performance of the actors was great, but thats not surprising when looking at all the big names ""Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine). They all are very convincing in their role and I think they did an excellent job.Also the end is very satisfying. It ends very mysterious and you really want to know what's going on.I recommend this movie to anyone who loves a great movie. This is simply one of best."
" Show stolen by David Bowie...
",,"Christopher Nolan films and I have something of a varied history together. While I found Memento insulting, poorly-written, badly-researched, and generally wearing its total lack of knowledge regarding a key plot device on its sleeve, other Nolan films like Batman Begins have sort of redeemed him. In essence, this makes him a bit like the drunk uncle who occasionally has something of import or interest to say. In any case, The Prestige, an intriguing concept that escaped my notice during its theatrical run, is one of the more interesting pieces to come out of the major studios during 2006. Naturally, the title makes no sense to anyone who is unfamiliar with the profession of the central characters, but a masterfully-delivered monologue by Michael Caine explains it all in a manner that leaves one unable to help thinking that it all works beautifully. If nothing else, Nolan knows how to get the best from his actors, and in storytelling of any variety, that tends to be half of the proverbial battle. Especially in a film like this where the performances are central to the story.The Prestige, named after the final stage of every magic act, concerns itself with a sibling-like rivalry between two stage magicians as portrayed by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. The one point where the film lets them down is that their characters are so identical in nature that one is not really sure until the final act, and not even then in a way, which one is meant to be the hero. Perhaps this was intentional, although it does come off as a goofy accident. Nonetheless, for most of the film's length, we see the two attempt to one-up each other as they vie for the attention of a fickle London audience, performing sleights of hand and other such illusions in a time when stage performance was very much an industry like modern television. The clear difference between the two characters that drives much of the story is that one is a better magician while the other is a considerably better stage performer. Jackman and Bale sell their characters so well that the lack of distinction between actor and character becomes irrelevant.So when I say that David Bowie performs the greatest trick of all during the film's running length by stealing the show, it is important to understand my full meaning. Bale and Jackman are performers at the top of their game, making films that cause the audience to rally behind them even when they are competing with more experienced or even better actors. This is a feat only a small percentage of today's acting pool are really capable of. Jackman in particular has accomplished the virtually impossible by making himself even more memorable than Sir Ian McKellen. So when Bowie walks into frame amidst a shower of lighting as Nikola Tesla, the classical misdirection here is that he is the most captivating and earnest performer. Recreating Tesla's seemingly insane experiments with AC electricity must have kept the special effects team up for weeks. But Bowie performs around them just as the real Tesla would sell them, by acting as if they were the most natural thing in the world. And Bowie even demonstrates they probably were to the real Tesla.Hence, when Bowie is not in the frame, the film tends to lose an otherworldly spark that he exudes as naturally as sweat. Not that this is a detriment to the film in any sense. During many sequences, Jackman and Bale make it clear that to their characters, this is just another day at work. All the awe and wonder we feel when we witness a great magic trick or an awesome performance act, even one as ridiculous as that of the Tokyo Shock Boys, simply does not translate from the seats to the stage. The Prestige makes that so abundantly clear that we are left with little wonder that performing clowns can be such maladjusted or sombre characters when the show is over. In an age where not even the ability to capture audio-visual displays as a string of ones and zeros amazes us anymore, The Prestige gives us a rude reminder of just how jaded we have become. It has been a long time since the DVD-Video format has held me in the same wide-eyed wonder as when I first experienced it, but boy did Bowie's introductory shot come close.At its heart, The Prestige is a story of obsession, a fact that is referenced in the dialogue so many times it might get monotonous to some viewers. Both Bale and Jackman seem consumed with the desire to show each other up that it makes the things they are willing to sacrifice in the process seem quite creepy. And the amazing thing is that it mostly works. With both characters appearing ready to sell out their own mothers to steal glory for a fleeting moment, it gives a whole new historical context to the invention of the American HDTV standard in order to snuff out the Japanese equivalent, and so forth. Whether the film industry would be in the comparative dire straits it is in today if all films worked so hard to create an illusory feel is probably irrelevant. What matters is that The Prestige destroys the argument that modern film does not make the effort to transport the audience. It shows the viewer something that they have not seen in quite this form before, and that is something of an achievement in an industry where it became all about the bottom line years ago.I gave The Prestige an eight out of ten. Parts such as the first half-hour lost me, but the image of Bowie walking through lightning will be burned onto my brain forever. See it just for that."
" Well made but off-puttingly complicated at times, especially towards the end
",,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning London, the turn of the Century. Magic is where the money is, turning the crowds out in their droves. And the top magicians of the times are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale.) They are rivals, but friendly rivals, engaging in a healthy sense of competition with each other. But Borden publicly denounces the tiredness of Angier repeatedly churning out the same crowd-pleasing tricks and demands something new. So they team up to pull off an idea of Borden's together, with tragic results. Angier's wife is killed and, blaming Borden, they become bitter rivals. But when Borden comes up with a new and innovative idea that wows the crowds, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to unwork it. So obsessed, bitterness, betrayal and murder become par for the course.Director Nolan seems obsessed with becoming Britain's answer to M Night Shyamalan with his high-concept sort of movies. He's doing a better job of it of late, that's for sure, and with the next Batman movie out soon, he's going to get the most commercial drive. But in between he's managed to make The Prestige, which will be unforgettable but not because it's great.Well, it's quite a good movie, if you can follow it, which I'm not sure many will be able to. This is such a complicated and multi-layered story that you'll be scratching your head more than once while it runs. But that, of course, actually makes it all the more intelligent, and you can't complain about that.The title, by the way, refers to the final act of the magic act, which Michael Caine's character guides us through in the early stages of the film. As he's stated before, he only acts for the joy of it these days without commanding a hefty fee, but there's nothing wrong with his performance here. He's just the start of the supporting cast, which also includes Andy Serkis and a surprise appearance from musician David Bowie.A good film, then, but maybe a bit too complicated and off-puttingly so for some viewers. #241 in the IMDb Top 250 is pushing it a bit. ***"
" It makes you think...
",,"Every once in a while, a movie comes along that makes you stop and think. A movie that shocks you, surprises you, and for 2 hours, takes you n the ride of your life. The Prestige is one of those few movies that have ever pulled it off.It was a surprisingly easy movie to follow, considering how often they jump around in time. The script was beautifully written, and the actors were excellent. Of course, you would expect that when you put Michael Caine, Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman in a movie together. The plot was also very strong, and leaves you second guessing everything you saw at the very end of the movie. You could discuss this movie for days and still not figure everything out.This is a movie you most defidently do NOT want to miss."
" A masterpiece - and Morgan Shepard is in it, too!
",,"This movie was a big surprise for me. I expected some kind of mystery thriller, but this movie was for more sophisticated as I thought it would be.First of all is the complex way it is narrated, with a narrator at the beginning and the end, but mostly a visual presentation of a diary that also takes into account another diary read by the owner of the first diary - and the owner of the second diary reads the first diary in jail! That's not the usual sweet and simple Hollywood brain candy, and it's obvious at this point that the movie must be based on a clever novel. That's probably also were the script's meditations on the nature of show magic come from. The ending will be a big, big revelation, but all the loose strands come together in a very ironic climax.Photography is good, if somewhat gloomy, fitting the plot, of course. But it's a wonderful break from the artificial and computer game like looking photography often found in Hollywood movies today.Acting is great overall, that's all there is to say. David Bowie is wonderful as the somewhat sinister, faustian inventor Tesla. And, of course, I was so surprised when I saw Morgan Shepard in his small but wonderful part! He's a magnificent and distinguished actor who mostly gets small parts, which is quite a shame. He was also in Ridley Scott's Duellists or the Seaquest TV serial.Anyway, the worst part of the movie is the score: while this bland and repetitive piece of music works OK in the movie (you don't hear much of it), it doesn't survive the light of day on a CD. That's no big surprise, though, when a score is ""produced"" by Hans Zimmer, that overrated wannabe score composer."
" Simply Awesome
",,"It has to be among the best movies made for quite some time. Christopher Nolan has again proved to be a gem. Christian Bale does his role with ease. All the characters just fit in so easy. Who ever thought that a story on eighteenth century magicians could be so interesting, involving and damn it, I have to agree it was deceptive, it does not fit in with the mind boggling sci-fi movie category but the script was so well written, that one cant just appreciate the movie if he does not get involved with it. The logic for a part of the ending can be conceived with many possible start points, but the beauty of this movie is, whatever be the start point and whatever be the path of your reasoning, you'll end up saying ""wow"" to the end. You might continue to debate on the nuances behind ""how it could have happened"", but you'll never debate on the quality of this gem. Congrats Mr. Nolan, ""The Prestige"" is the rightful successor to ""Memento""."
" Top notch flick
",,"I watched this movie once on a weekend night while I had other things on my mind, but then watched it again at home by myself and felt it was one of the best movies I've seen in a very long time. I'm not good with words, but this movie has everything a true movie goer is looking for. From theatrics to a great storyline to a great message. I gave this flick a 10 and recommend it to anyone that has a passion for movies like myself-joeI said what I want to say but IMDb, though being a site I like very much is giving me issues for not having enough lines in my comment. I typed all that I was willing to say and am now simply dragging on so that my post may be seen by others. I appreciate everyones patience and thank you if you've actually read this far, Thank You, Joe Magnuson"
" Really dark and twisted...
",,"Christopher Nolan's latest offering from his brother's story is not only a dark and thrilling adventure filled with mysterious plot twists but also a brilliant character study. The two leading characters are written wonderfully and their style of never-ending rivalry was really a pleasure to watch. Their contrasting style as magicians, their markedly different points of view were really designed well. It was an interesting take on how success changed their lives in two different manners.Like the characters they play, the two leading actors also constantly kept on trying to outshine each other. Jackman pulls off a very convincing and controlled performance as Angier, the perfect entertainer. But I must say it's Christian Bale who steals the show as the mysterious Alfred who never lets out a secret until it's time. His character has so many dimensions and his performance is just utterly flawless. You can see mystery in his eyes and smell it in his words.Among the other actors, Michael Caine again delivers a purely professional supporting role. Scarlett Johansson as Olivia is somewhat one-dimensional and she did not receive the best dialogues too. It was fun to watch David Bowie as Nicola Tesla. I think he does a fair job to this sort of off-beat character.Nolan's direction is the major thing which makes this film tick. He spreads the story into several non-linear segments and although it might seem confusing to the audience to follow the plot in this different time-period segments, it successfully enhances the atmosphere of mystery. The plot twists are never rushed and each takes its own time to grow. Although I didn't like the absurd basic idea behind the true explanation of 'transported man'... still the ending is excellently executed.May the Nolans keep this quality up."
" A real gem; a movie that is thoughtful, creative and brilliant
",,"This must be one of the real finds of 2006 for me personally. Not that my expectations of this movie were a little low but that I just thought that this type of movie could only go so far in terms of plot and direction. With some excellent twists, tremendous acting and engrossing storyline The Prestige came out as quite possibly my choice movie of 2006. Let me start with the acting. Just excellent, with the likes of Jackman and Caine and even David Bowie putting in a great cameo appearance. Christian Bale, once again, proved that he is an excellent talent. I think his range of acting makes him one of the most sought after actors of his generation and he has never disappointed when I have watched his movies.The story revolves around two competing magicians/illusionists, who after an unfortunate event begin an obsessive game of cat and mouse to see who comes out on top as a premier magician. Both performers do not hold back to sabotage each other's acts as the game gets increasingly more sinister and deadly. The movie, for me anyway, starts off a little slow, but I promise you to persevere. The effort you'll put in to understand each man's motivations, to understand their backgrounds and to lay the foundations for the second half is well worth it. I cannot emphasise this point enough as at one point, I must confess I thought 'just what is the point here?'. But the movie begins to make sense and comes together quite expertly and as the pace lifts you'll be wanting more by the end."
" Splendid story of the dual nature of everything!
",spoiler,"Layer upon layer of this story keeps sweeping over me. It lapses and recedes, fading after only a few minutes past the credits. I'd like recommend this movie not only as an entertainment, but as a philosophic proposal about 'right' versus 'wrong'.The movie begins with a very good question about ""getting your hands dirty"" and it's this very question that adults *should* think about when facing judgment about war and crime. The fact is that anybody can justify how far they go. But it's the accountability to those whom you effect that matters.For those who haven't seen the movie, this all probably means nothing to you and you think I'm talking like an idiot. Assume you are right and see the movie anyway. It's dark humor and tricks will give credit to a well made production, with the well-matched talents of all the actors.It seems funny that they had to get Hugh to take off his shirt in almost any movie he's been in, and while I don't complain about it, it seemed almost cheap for this performance. I wonder if it was in the contract?This was an emotionally turbulent movie, and although I never felt compelled to cry due to my leathery nature, there are many significant scenes that would be too traumatic for the gentle-hearted and young. Seeing someone drown is bad one time, seeing it happen several times is even more so. Funny how watching an actor get shot isn't nearly as harmful?"
" Great Yarn!
",,"This is why I go the cinema. To be entertained. And this movie does it all the way through. Highly engaging, compelling, stimulating, exciting, the superlatives go on and on. The cinematography is worth admission alone. Great performance from all actors except David Bowie who just about passed first base. The period setting was totally convincing and the on stage drama the best since Amadeus. The intense atmosphere created by Bale and his stage rivals really keeps your eyes glued to the screen. The film really has the lot, including just the right amount of romantic interest but not too much and the girls are quite stunning.I would give this film a best movie Oscar."
" The Prestige is just magic!
",spoiler,"This movie was excellent. Probably the most original I have seen all year. It was a little confusing to some people(my friend was totally lost) but at the end you will either be saying ""Huh?"" or ""OHHHH!! I GET IT!"". I understood it, and then I had to spend 15 minutes explaining it to my friend. When he finally got it, I had to bring it over to my friend, Annie's house, so she could watch it.The movie has a great story. Robert Angier and Alfred Bordan are two magicians, they are friends and both excellent magicians. But after Angier's wife, Julia(Piper Perabo) drowns in a trick gone wrong, the two become enemies for life. Angier is now trying to steal Bordan's trick of magic. So he sends his beautiful assistant(and lover), Olivia Wenscombe(Scarlett Johannson) to steal it for him. Olivia doesn't like this, so she hates Angier and becomes Bordan's lover and partner. Also, Bordan is having trouble at home, his wife Sarah, is having a hard time living the way they are. I don't want to spoil anything more.The performances were excellent. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were terrific in their roles and played them perfectly. Michael Caine plays Cutter, and that's another wonderful performance. Scarlett Johansson was good as Olivia. Some people complained she was flat compared to the other actors, but I liked her in here. Her fake accent was very convincing. Same goes for Piper Perabo(Julia). She wasn't in the film very long but she played it very well and put on the fake accent very well. My favorite performance was by Bordan's daughter, Jess. She was just so adorable. I also liked the performance of Sarah. I felt very bad for her because she started out happy and then she just was never happy anymore. This was a great film. One of the best. Comes in my top 4(The Departed, Little Miss Sunshine, The Prestige, Casino Royale) I highly recommend this movie. It was very good. Great cast, great script, great story, great directing! Acting: A+ Script: A+ Story: A+ Plot Twists: A+ Suspense: A+ Ending: A+Final Grade: A+ Stars: 10/10 Percent: 100In general: This movie rules!"
" Good show, but just short of true magic.
",,"In some sense, you can consider The Prestige Christopher Nolan's return to his Memento tricks after his bat-movie excursion. Working again with his writer-brother Jonathan, Nolan brings us back to a movie that spins and whirs with movie magic, but as much as I'm impressed by the presentation of the film, I feel like somewhere along the way, the film lost its heart. Let me explain.The basic setup is this: Two young magicians become bitter and deadly rivals after a trick goes wrong. When we start the movie, we hear Michael Caine telling us the basics of magic. There's the pledge, the turn and the prestige. Nolan (or shall I say Nolans?), trickster that he is, takes this concept of magic and uses it as the structure to the film as well. This is akin to how Nolan built his narrative structure in Memento around the memory loss concept, but in The Prestige, the story is told far more straightforwardly than its predecessor, even with all of its twists and turns.Yes, this is a movie about magic, like its recent colleague The Illusionist and like what you'd expect from a film about magic, things aren't as they seem in the film. But the Prestige left enough clues early on that a well-read kid like me could pick up on all the twists and turns before they came. Fortunately, the film still manages to be quite fun even if you know what's coming up because the presentation of the film is quite enjoyable. Nolan has this stony directorial style that bathes everything in a shade of cool, which works really well for movies about bat-themed crusaders and yes, even about magic.On the downside, the film spends so much time trying to be tricky that I think it misses out a little on the tragedy of the two characters. Not to say that it doesn't touch on it, but I feel the overall film would've benefited a bit from focusing just a little less on the ""ooh, I'm so clever"" turns and a little more on the different effects of obsession on the main characters and its consequences on their lives. By the time the credits rolled, I saw that the film was trying, but it wasn't enough to get me at a visceral level. There was too much cool, too much showmanship and it was all very entertaining, but I saw hints of a really good drama underlying it all and I think it got lost a little in all the show.I loved the period stuff, I loved that Nikola Tesla was put in the film, played surprisingly well by rocker David Bowie. The minor characters and the major characters, I felt, were all played well and the direction was clear. I do have to admit that I probably would've been even more impressed by the film if I wasn't able to peek behind the wizard's curtain and figure things out too early. And unlike The Illusionist, this film does resolve its magic, so you're not left unsatisfied by an ambiguous story.The other problem I had with the story is that it was hard to develop sympathy for the main characters once they started battling. What they do doesn't draw sympathy anymore because there doesn't seem to be much left to redeem--both characters become shells of men and there's nothing left for me to hope for. Despite the fact that we are given the perspective of Hugh Jackman's character, I found myself just as much concerned (even though it wasn't much) for Christian Bale's character. But since both characters have such despicable traits and neither seems to really manage to overcome them or add a real dimension of humanity to them, they become a little two-dimensional.But still, I was genuinely entertained, just by the impressive presentation and storytelling. And it's a rather enjoyable film about magic. I was just let down because the setup had potential to be a little more and it didn't seize it. A rather enjoyable film, but not great. 8/10."
" I wish I could give 11.
",,"If I could be granted one wish it would be that I could give The Prestige an 11 rating. It's an outstanding movie, far from anything you've ever seen. At first, my only motives for seeing this movie were seeing it with this kid I liked and because I'm madly in love with Christian Bale. I didn't pay much attention to my date. I was completely entranced by this movie. Normally I can detect upcoming plot twists and foreshadowing gives everything away to me. But in The Prestige... it's an exceptionally excellent plot. I was terribly surprised... not that it was terrible... it was exciting. The acting is superb. Absolutely and powerfully believable. I get very into things, like books, video games, and especially movies. Watching this movie got rather intense. The effects are amazing. It's a bit of a fairy tale but it seems so real. As someone put it, The Prestige is ""storytelling at it's best."" I concur, 100%. I am making a list of movies you must see before you die. The Prestige is definitely on it. This is hands-down, thumbs-up, one of the best movies I have ever seen and I'm exceptionally proud to call myself a fan of Christian Bale and The Prestige."
" Now you see it...now you don't. See it!
",,"Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are magicians who constantly try to one-up one another in this excellent film. Michael Caine is the mastermind behind the tricks. Scarlett Johansson is one of the magician's assistants. David Bowie is, get this, Nicola Tesla the great inventor. The film is clever, with plot twists galore and the ending is interesting, although you may figure it out if you are the type who always tries to figure out how a magic trick is done. Solid acting from everyone, interesting sets, and the film has a great look to it. Don't expect any historical accuracy. This is just a film with a very clever premise which is basically to try to trick the audience until the very end."
" Don't forget Rebecca Hall
",,"Not much to add to the comments about a film that will be remembered as an outstanding milestone in the careers of Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Christopher Nolan. Except to note that Rebecca Hall turns in a heartbreaking performance as the loving, tragic Sarah, victim of her husband's obsession, despite his partial (not exactly the right word but what is) love for her. Her perceptive take on the secret defining her husband's twisted nature is the essential clue in the movie, though so subtly put that it's almost impossible to catch until that secret is revealed.What a year for great movies! ""Illusionist"", ""Scarlet Veil"", ""Prestige"", ""Last King of Scotland"", ""Babel"", ""Scandal"", etc, etc...And even the flawed films like ""Good German"" had riveting performances. Film is back this year in a fantastic way and ""Prestige"" is one of the, if not the, best."
" WOW just WOW
",,"What do you want me say about this movie. It is an excellent movie, it has all meaning of thriller, surprising movie, full of twists. All i can say that this movie is a masterpiece. Believe me watch it and see for your self. The acting by Christian.B. is excellent so is Hugh Jackman. The story is unique well written and directed. Well basically u will be surprised the whole time, this movie took the 1st place in my top 10 collection instead of the Godfather. ;). I really enjoyed every second of this movie, and the time really went fast. I really thought it should be 3 or 4 houres long thats how interesting this movie was.So i give this movie 10 out of 10 for perfection."
" Nolan does it again...
",,"I have been a rather large fan of Christopher Nolan's work, (Batman Begins, Memento, Insomnia...) and The Prestige is no exception. It is extremely well directed and very well written. The acting is mostly amazing! I never though Hugh Jackman could do such a good job acting. And Christian Bale... Great! I was told about this movie from a friend of mine, and when he told me about it, I was really pessimistic about going to see it... Boy, was I wrong. I was expecting a movie that was long, boring, and just hard to watch... Take it from me, this movie is none of those three things. I definitely believe that this movie deserves its spot in the top 250. I even think it should be brought down into the low 100s, if not the high 90s. THis movie has made a spot in my top 5, and I really think this is one of very few modern-day masterpieces."
" A Breathtaking Tale of Obsession and Deceit...
",,"Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are extraordinary in this mind-bending fantasy thriller. I couldn't get enough of the movie and it's true - you immediately want to watch it a second time. Well directed and written, spectacularly acted by the whole cast and it keeps you guessing even after the credits finish rolling.If that isn't enough, the cinematography and art direction were wonderful. There's a real ""magic"" feel to the film and a surreal sense of wonderland. Who is the true protagonist? Antagonist? What is real and what is illusion? This film will keep you on the edge of your seat. Watch and decide for yourself. It's worth it."
" great movie, dark story about an all consuming rivalry
",,"""The Prestige"" is a movie by the same writers/director as ""Memento"" so I had great expectations and luckily I wasn't disappointed at all.First of all it looks great, a lot of effort went into the details of the locations and costumes etc. It's very moody and the whole atmosphere of a late 1800's England fits just right. The acting is great too, all characters in the story are understandable and believable. Also, by introducing the historic character Nikola Tesla a certain it-could-be-true feeling is added to the movie (very entertaining performance by David Bowie by the way).The movie covers a long time-span and shows many interesting locations, so in a way it's also an adventure movie. There are several twists but it's all integral to the storyline and not just some gimmick. As always with these kind of twists, a lot of people pat themselves on the back because they figured it all out right away (or so they claim). But for me the twist wasn't the biggest surprise in the end.Instead, the amazement comes when you think about what the main characters must have been through all along, the sacrifice. At the end you suddenly look back and realize how their single-mindedness, their obsessiveness has gradually taken them to a very dark place. That's the part you'll keep thinking about after seeing it.Great movie, highly recommended."
" one of the best of 2006
",,"Christopher Nolen further proves that he's definitely a writer/director to look out for with this excellent tale of feuding magicians. Without naming any actors specifically, they're all uniformly great in this film. I was captivated from beginning to end and that in itself is pretty impressive and no mean feat. The fact that none of the actors were even nominated for this years Oscars is a mild travesty as it's definitely one of the best acted films I'd seen in 2006. And yes the ending can be seen coming a whiles away if one's paying even the mildest of attention, but that doesn't really detract from the experience one iota. It's definitely not a feel good movie to say the least, but it's simply superb.My Grade: A"
" It takes 15 Min's to figure it out
",,"Do not be alarmed, this does NOT contain spoilers. If you are, like me, a fan of the BBC series Jonathan Creek (detective series where the technical adviser to magician Adam Klaus teams up with a reporter to solve murders using the same method that is behind the magic shows. The adviser is named Jonathan Creek, hence the title) , you will probably think you have to see this movie, but you really don't. It relies on the same logic and tricks as all movies and series about ""magic"" do, although this one has a plot-twist, which by the way, you can see coming if you know how movies usually present such things. I figured the entire movie out in a quarter of an hour, although there remained some blanks in the picture, so I enjoyed the first 1 1/2 hour, but I have to warn you that this movie is cruel with many people getting hurt in many different ways and it is NOT a feel-good movie. Hugh Jackman is brilliant, though, reminded me of Thimothy Dalton (well he calls himself the Great Danton, coincidence? Yes.) And I would give Hugh my Hero of this movie vote, as I believe he is the guy you feel for. That is also why this movie sucks: you can pick either character to be your ""hero"", because well I get the feeling that the editor and director did not really realize you should pick one. This movie shifts between the two lead magicians as bad-guy and hero, which can be fun, but it is not. I left this movie feeling rotten and so did my party. They didn't all get it as fast as I did, so you may be amazed yet. But I'd pick a better movie if I were you, although pickings are slim at this time of year... Or: see this movie and leave half an hour early. Trust me, you'll feel better without it."
" The magic is in not knowing
",,"The Prestige is for my money, one of the best films on the subject of magic. Christopher Nolan has created a film that, like his earlier film Memento, plays on audience perception. The film is even presented like a magic trick. In magic there is the pledge in which the audience is shown something ordinary. At the start of the film we are shown a trick gone wrong as Hugh Jackman dies, drowning in a glass cage. The turn is where the magician performs the trick. For this film, the turn is the bulk of the storyline as we bounce back and forth through time following Angiers (Jackman) and fellow magician Borden (Christian Bale) as they study and master magic tricks. A tragic accident causes Angiers wife to die and a rivalry to grow between the two magicians. We watch as Angiers grows increasingly obsessed in his search for the secrets of Borden's tricks. Borden in the present tense of the story is on trial and sentenced to hang for Angiers death. Mixing these events, Nolan tantalizes the audience with many sleights of hand which will leave you guessing. It is only the end, or the prestige of the trick that all is revealed and we see how this story has truly played out. While I won't give up the twist, it is a very fun twist that does nothing to dampen the rest of the film. The Prestige is dark to be sure but there have been darker films over the years. Kudos go to Michael Caine, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale for standout performances and to Nolan for a superb script and nuanced direction. Give this one a go."
" This is 'THE' movie you must see!
",,"We are a very finicky movie-going-group. We check reviews & friends that have seen a movie before making the rare trip to the theater. This movie is definitely one you will want to see on both the big screen & add to your home collection. There are so many different turns & twists that keep your attention, you will not notice the few slow spots. The only (slightly) negative things we did not enjoy were the overly darkened scenes that made it difficult to see what was happening & some use of very low sound tracks during some crucial dialog. This script has one of the absolute best endings I have witnessed in years - not one of us saw it coming, even though the clues were right there all along (think '6th Sense'). I especially enjoyed the fact that there was no gratuitous sex or needless gore. Our little group could Not stop talking about this movie & anxiously wait to see it again (& again)."
" Secrets are my life
",,"I rarely sit down to write a review for a film I have seen, but this movie is well worth my time.I have seen it three times, and honestly have thoroughly enjoyed it all three times. I have seen hundreds upon hundreds of movies, and I cannot at the moment think of another I can say this about.So what is it about the prestige? Is it the BEST story? Is it the BEST acting? Is it the BEST cinematography? I would say the answer to these three questions is probably no, not BEST, but very very good. When a film can succeed in such a way on so many levels, it makes a lasting impression. The Prestige is definitely this type of movie, and one of the most entertaining I've ever seen.The acting is marvelous. Maybe nothing Oscar worthy, but this movie didn't call for that type of role. Christian Bale is perfectly mysterious, Hugh Jackman is spot on as a revenge seeking widower, and Michael Caine adds exactly the right support to bring it all together.The cinematography and art direction really give this movie the mood it needs to be memorable. You will be sucked in to its mystery, and each scene will keep you on the brink of illusion and reality.Christopher Nolan's touch of teeter tottering timelines may frustrate the casual viewer, but it will challenge and entertain those who are ready to tackle the secrets of the film. You will be guessing and guessing, hoping for that home run of an ending, and trust me...it's a grand slam. You will not be disappointed. Better than Memento.But what is it that takes this from a great movie to a masterpiece? For me it was the sounds. The mysterious score added wonder to all the right moments, making this more than a movie, but an experience that I will look forward to being a part of again and again.Every element was there, every aspect executed in superb fashion. A 10 if there ever could be one. Movie-making magic!"
" Miraculous cinematography
",,"I admit, I 'm fun of Nolan movies. However is really difficult to avoid comparison with his older masterpieces, especially the memorable ""Memento"" and yet this one is one his highest achievements undoubtedly. A few notes only that worth a few arguments: the very persuasive sense of the era of late 1800s, one of the most interesting of all times; he managed to give the deepest depth of the 2 main characters and the master Caine, at his best roles/acting ever, he fitted like the hand in glove; for a movie that could easily slip in the category of ""entertaining"" aspect of cinema ,mainly,because of the theme itself never did. Is the first time that I see the beloved Scarlet J and not ""concentrate"" on her at all, neither even comment on her; the plot and the mystery wouldn't leave my notice a moment to spent on her physical assets, but the serious part of the plot; that had never had an inch of chasm, neither left any doubt to the rather unbelievable, almost surreal happenings and scenes; the logic was always there masterly hidden. Also the Tesla character is as peculiar as should be; N Tesla was one of the most genius, non-conventional scientists of all times and the choice of Bowie added a lot to that feeling. Of course, last but not least, the astonishing ending, that one moment ago could not be expected neither imagined in such an imaginative scenario. Thank you Mr. Nolan once again, keep it on!"
" Unique!
",,"It's a movie that could change the way you ""act"" your life, and interact with people, things and feelings around you. It may get you to study about the magic tricks and illusions and there you will understand after a while, the thing that this movie shows. Bravo! Bravo! Bravo! Actors, writers, directors and all crew! Bravo! And really looking through the other comments, and judging by myself i really don't think i have seen anything like it. And the music gets you involve a lot, some said it's a little too long, the time you INVEST watching this movie deserves every minute. And i would ask each and everyone of you that saw this movie and read this comment: ""share it with all the people you know"", don't start to tell them more than you can see on-line, the description of it, send them to the theater to see it."
" Now Thats a Christopher Nolan Film...
",,"The Prestige, aptly suited for the title...you can not ignore it. The word Prestige itself means the final part/act of the magic trick, and the film ends with a well crafted ending. I have not read the novel, by Christopher Priest, but then the picturization is complete in itself...at least for me.To what limits can a man go to take revenge...or for the ultimate magic trick. The film is a carefully woven tale of two magicians and their rivalry, and is something that keep you glued to your seats right till the end. Now thats some storytelling. A must see for Nolan's fan and I just kept thinking, how does he do it. The Memento and Batman Begins fame director/screenplay writer at his best again. The way his films are directed, the manner in which story is told always keeps you captivated and there is certainly no escaping this one. Go ahead and see for yourself for the ultimate magic trick..."
" Abra Kadabra

Both actors Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale work so great together. You can feel the heat between this two magicians rivalry. Scarlett Johansson gives a good performance. It's very creative, how everything was done in this movie. The twists of this movie are incredible! Makes you go back and forth. It's very genius how everything falls into place in the end of the movie. Also the way it was edited was absolutely genius. The main thesis sticks to the end. In addition, the quotes from the movie are absolutely great. It's definably watching over and over again. It's worth your time. Truly a MUST see!"
" Very well acted, one of the best films done for a while
",,"I had seen the trailer for this film but didn't know what to think of it. I put off watching it several times, but when i eventually did watch it.... WOW!!!! What a fantastic film it turned out to be. Michael Caine is great, as are the two leading male roles. Plus the added bonus of the gorgeous Scarlett Johannson, she is just simply stunning. She'd look good in whatever you dressed her in, plus she can act too. The twists and turns in this film are great, they keep you hooked right till the end, and what an ending. The other good thing about it is it takes you back in time to explain certain things that happen in the movie. Very well directed. I enjoyed it that much, i took my girlfriend to see it a couple of days later, and thoroughly enjoyed it once more. Really is a must see film."
" is this the actual ending?
",,"THE PLOT: Alfred Borden and Rupert Angier rise to become world-renowned stage magicians. Early in their careers, they meet and a bitter feud develops as they constantly try to out-do, and even sabotage, the other's acts The events of the past are revealed primarily through each of the magicians' diaries. Borden develops an act called The Transported Man, and an improved version named The New Transported Man, which appears to move him from one closed cabinet to another in the blink of an eye and without appearing to pass through the intervening space. The act seems to defy physics and puts all previous acts to shame. Although never explicitly revealed, it seems probable that the secret of The Transported Man is that Borden, all his life, has been two people; his trick involves extreme use of a twin brother as a double, to the extent that they both live the same life. Angier cannot discern the method that Borden uses and desperately tries to equal him, and with the help of the acclaimed physicist Nikola Tesla For Angier's trick, Tesla successfully creates a device capable of teleporting a being from one place to another, but which has a surprising side-effect.THE ENDING!!! The first time WHEN angier uses the device in his workshop alone, one of two things happen. The first interpretation is that the original Angier shoots his newly-materialized duplicate dead on the spot. In subsequent uses of the machine for public performance, the original is dropped through a trapdoor into a tank of water, drowning him, leaving only the new ""transported"" Angier alive. However, it can be argued that the first time Angier uses the device, the first duplicate killed the original, and the other duplicates drowned during the performances. It is believed that the Angier in the new location is a duplicate, and their personalities are exactly alike. The final scene of the movie reveals a long dark corridor, the walls lined with metal-reinforced glass tanks, each containing a secretly-drowned Angier.Borden again breaks into the backstage area. However this time he sees one of the clones drowning. He is seen watching Angier die, accused of murdering Angier, and sentenced to death by hanging. In the end one of the brothers dies while the other lives on to take revenge on Angier, killing him amid his deceased duplicates RATING 8.5\10"
" The prestige has a ""prestige""...
",,"First of all Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman was a great choice for the roles and also i don't think anybody could expect anything less from the young but talented Christopher Nolan.Everything about the movie from the costumes the music to the atmosphere puts you right inside the it.I don't want to get analyzing the scenes or what happens to during the movie because i think that the best part is to go the cinema and just be surprised,not only with the quit different story but from the fact that even when you think that you know whats coming up next you will probably be wrong because you'll be surprised again.For me this is one the best privileges that a movie can have since when you are a movies fan after so many movies you have watched it seems like you're always going to know what is going to happen,even maybe the finale of the story from its beginning. Another really realistic and maybe somehow terrifying fact that you become aware of by watching the movie is what one can do to achieve his biggest desires. In general its a very smart movie,the plot never lets you slack. I don't like getting overstate but this might be for me the best movie of the year.It's a must see.If you are a movies fan watching this movie will remind you why you became one,on the other hand if you are not,this I think is a great reason to start being one."
" As good as it gets....

But then, when you feel an obsessive compulsive disorder to give it a rating of 10( it does not happen very often, does it? ) you have to do it then and there, because you want others to know how good you felt after watching the movie. Yes, it is one of the best movies, I have seen in the recent past.""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge."" The magician shows you something ordinary...but, of course, it probably isn't. "" The movie starts off with this amazing dialog, delivered by Michael Caine. Yeah, you are right; the dialog is something ordinary... but, of course it probably isn't. You will realize it as the movie progresses.""The second act is called ""The Turn.""

You are sure, if you had looked carefully enough, you would have been able to find the secret. You didn't; and there you are. You are not too amused, because you know that you too could have done the same, just that you don't have the speed and given enough time and patience you too should be able to do it.""That's why there's a third act, called ""The Prestige."" This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking that you've never seen before."" Now, it is dangerous. You probably don't want it to happen. You are too overwhelmed by the shock. You admire it. You want to give it a big hand. You don't give a damn as to whether it appeared ordinary in the beginning. You just know that, it is unbelievable.Let us do away with the metaphors. I can go on and on. To cut short, it is a story of revenge, deception and probably love. I would say the movie is sheer magic. And the magicians are Jonathan Nolan and Christopher Nolan."
" It's not just about a couple of magicians!
",spoiler,"You don't see this kind of movies coming to scene every year, it might take another decade to watch such an excellent one. I think The two magicians can represent two poles of any kind: From the scale of two normal persons competing in real life to two country leaders. Two rivals obsessed by a self destructive competition for the sake of getting all the glory. They both forgot the initial reason for which they started this. Each of them became obsessed trying to become the greatest no matter what the cost is. The choice of magic as a playground competition is the right one, as magicians trick the audience with illusions, it could be leaders tricking their people in real life with their own kind of illusions(Wrong cause, wrong battlefield...etc). For the sci-fi part, the poor scientific base doesn't worry me a lot as it succeeded to deliver the message of how dangerous and destructive it can be. Definitely a great movie worth watching!"
" Beyond good and evil
",,"Nolan's last haunting masterpiece is an impressive allegory about ambition, sacrifice, arrogance, obsession, titanic effort to go beyond natural limits and to challenge God. Nietzsche ""Ubermensch"" concept is embodied in the fight between these two Victorian-Age magicians, as well as the conflict between science and wizardry, instinct and rationality, respect of the rules and compulsive intention to go beyond good and evil. When you go out of the cinema, you think about the inner sense of this movie again, and again, and again... Great emotions, great plot (a sort of Greek tragedy!), great meta-reflection about perception, theories of mind, and psychological blindness: a great movie. Abracadabra!"
" """"The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before. ""
",,"I went to see this film with high expectations.....and i was not disappointed!I thought i had the plot pretty much sussed at one point, then WHAM, with a twist and sting in the tail my ideas were altered, leaving me bewildered and gob smacked.I spent nearly the same amount of time after seeing the Prestige simply discussing and unwinding the little details that conclude the film with my friends.If i had any doubts about Christian Bale- I now stand corrected. He was perfectly believable, with not even Michael Caine shadowing him. Plus this was a perfect role for Hugh Jackman to come out of his shell- after playing stereotypical dark and mysterious super heroes with cheesy lines lately. Go and see it is all i can recommend, and it will certainly join my vast collection when released on DVD."
" A Masterpiece
",,"In the beginning i was reluctant about this movie but the director drive my mind to the theatre because i'm a big fan of memento. I left the movie just like a zombie with a million concept ideas about the story. It's a Masterpiece with a solid acting and a wonderful and intelligent screenplay. Christopher Nolan was the great magician with the real prestige in the end of the movie. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale divide the master role of this game of ambition, Michael Cane the mentor of both. They will deceive us with mind tricks, they will fool our minds with illusions about the story.If you love movies that splinters your mind don't loose this outstanding work of art."
" The Names
",,"I don't know if this has been mentioned in any other post or not, but I was quite intrigued at the initials of the two protagonists - Alfred Borden (AB) and Robert Angier (RA). Abracadabra also happens to be the last word that Bale's character utters. I think Olivia summarized it beautifully when she said 'You two belong to each other'. Angier and Borden are in fact, two sides of the same coin. In fact, they are very much like the coin trick that Borden pulls on that young kid - two sides are the same. This aspect is emphasized by the fact that one gets shot in the hands, another hurts his leg, one a showman, the other the more talented magician. They actually complete each other."
" Complex Plot with Twists upon Twists and a Horrific and Shocking Ending
",,"I went to this movie with my brother and his girlfriend. Only about one in eight seats in the theater were taken, not that many. Most of the people in the audience seemed young.The movie starts off ordinarily. The first half is a series of events. The movie jumps from one time period to another. Many scenes left me scratching my head. A magic trick consists of three stages: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. Like a magic trick the movie started out ordinary. Borden and Angier are two magicians in deep rivalry. They go to great lengths to sabotage the other's work. It got to the point where every time they were performing a magic trick on stage I would anticipate something would go wrong. Many of these tricks involved guns and axes, so I was preparing myself for something very loud and shocking.After about halfway through the rather ordinary story of rivalry turns interesting as the two magicians read their diaries. But still I felt disoriented and didn't fully grasp everything. Towards the end though, everything made sense, and the plot fell together. It is a very complex and very shocking story. It is not just the plot that was excellent. The film seemed to have a lot to say in terms of themes. I won't give away too much but at the end the little girl Jess watches the magic trick that involves the little bird disappearing. She's amazed by it. She may want to know how the trick is done but once you realize how it is done it's probably not a good idea to tell her. Essentially the world is simple, cold, cynical, and miserable, but these tricks give happiness because they suggest this is not so. This deception is not isolated to simple magic tricks. The vanishing bird trick is analogous to what happens to the magicians. Some people will go to great lengths for an art.I enjoyed this film not just for its plot. I started to think that deception is just in the magic shows. They are not just in the characters and their lives. They are everywhere. It watched this movie six days before Christmas and in many ways Santa Clause is a magic trick, a deception. But it's more than that. I look at the football fans in stadiums and wonder whether they are just individuals proud of their teams or country or whether they are just totally deceived by marketers. In my life pretty much everything that gave me happiness turned out to be quite simple, quite pessimistic in reality, whether it's religion, family, or love. There is no magic, just science. There is no emotion, just biochemistry. No country, just politics. No morality, just power. Like the vanishing bird trick, you just don't want to know how it's done.Now when I spoke to people after the movie most of them didn't mention these ideas to me. They were too busy asking me about the mechanics of the plot, who was who, why this happened, and so on. But I think if you plan to watch the movie you should focus on more than what happened on screen. Try to infer certain concepts from the film and relate these to what you already know from experience in your own life. You may be quite surprised.The movie probably shouldn't be seen by small children. One reason is because of the on-screen deaths that occur."
" a strong piece of cinematic legerdemain
",,"Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"" is a finely crafted piece of cinematic presdedigitation - a tale of two master magicians in turn-of-the-century London whose bitter rivalry leads to deception, dismemberment and eventually murder.Robert Angier and Alfred Borden are the two up-and-coming magicians who part ways when Alfred is deemed to be partly responsible for the death of Robert's beloved wife (while functioning as a magician's assistant) in one of their acts on stage. Consumed with the desire for revenge and spurred on by professional jealousy, Robert spends the remainder of his days working to undermine and destroy Alfred's career and life.With the help of some first-rate artists on both sides of the camera, Nolan (along with his brother and co-writer Jonathan) has fashioned a fine looking work from Christopher Priest's popular novel. The solid production values - meticulous period details beautifully enhanced by Wally Pfiser's glowing cinematography - offer a compelling backdrop for the human drama at the movie's core. More than anything else, the film is a tribute to the stagecraft inherent in the art of magic making. The movie provides not only a fascinating behind-the-scenes glimpse into how that magic is made, but works its own sleight-of-hand trickery on the audience with its complex, multi-level time structure and its I-never-saw-that-coming, turnabout ending.The performances by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, and David Bowie are all top notch, with Bale and Jackman, in particular, getting to display some of their acting chops in the lead roles.On the slightly negative side, the film might have been more successful had it remained entirely in the realm of the real world of magic making and resisted the temptation of turning to science fiction to help move its plot along. Still, that's a minor quibble about a movie that delivers the goods on so many levels of entertainment."
" A dark and twisting snake of a film!
",,"The Prestige is an awesome film. The character development is done really well and I was drawn into the film despite being sceptical of it.For me it was Christian Bale that stole the show. He favours the understated style of acting and understands that a lot of the time less is more. This makes for a believable and heart felt performance.My favourite aspect of the film and part of its beauty is the way the film is been structured. The explanation at the beginning of the film of the three stages of a magic trick could also be applied to the plot. The following quote sums up how the film is created: ""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary some thing do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" The Prestige has more than enough twists to keep you on edge and even though you know they're coming they're still clever.For all the praise I can give there are few criticisms. Parts of the storyline don't quite seem to fit together. I found myself having to let a few faults and coincidences go in order to enjoy the film.I particularly liked the three levels that the film operated on. As a simple film about two magicians feuding with a colourful storyline; as a drama that sucked the viewer in and made the characters problems and successes your own; and finally the level that makes this film stand out was the darker side to the film. A plot that reveals itself in the end as a sinister struggle full of death and treachery.The Prestige is a must see so book your ticket now! : )"
" Filled with Darkness and Mystery....but ends up great!
",spoiler,"Certainly one of the darker, yet more interesting films of the year, The Prestige sets out to tell a story full or originality and intrigue. Magic is a hard subject to resist. There is a part within all of us that has an avid curiosity and need to know how to explain the unexplainable. Of course, once it's revealed, almost all interest is lost, and it seems it's time to move onto the next thing. The Prestige tells a lot. I won't venture too far for fear of giving too much away, but while much is revealed in this film, there is still a lot to scratch your head over as the final credits roll (to a magnificent Thom Yorke song I might add). Yes, The Prestige has all the elements that keep your head spinning. Is it good? Yes. Will it stay with you? Yes. I'm just not sure I want that much darkness to follow me home.The Prestige, (like The Illusionist also released this year) is another thriller about 19th-century stage magicians with secrets which advances so far beyond its recent predecessor that only the subject matter entices me to mention them in the same sentence. Credit lies with director Christopher Nolan, who approaches his projects with a dark vision that I find wholly appealing. He wanders through the shadows of human desire and ambition, coloring his observations with sarcastic wit that staves off the despair to which they might otherwise succumb. Showbiz illusion makes a natural fit for Nolan. He understands as few others how much film has in common with it -- and Christopher Priest's source novel sets a story uniquely suited to his sensibilities. It centers on the bitter antagonism between two rival performers, once friends apprenticed under the same man, but now poisoned by jealousy and reproach. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a master of technique, grasping sleight-of-hand mechanics with unparalleled insight. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is less physically adept, but makes up for it with supremely charismatic stage presence. This is something that his counterpart never quite got the hang of. Both have good reason to despise one another. Borden's arrogance once triggered an accident that cost Angier dearly, leading to an act of vengeance that threatened to cripple Borden's performing abilities for good. The two survived and went on to successful careers, but the seeds of hate were planted deep, and now the good things in their lives mean nothing when compared to the prospect of destroying each other.The interesting and visually brilliant technique that Nolan uses in keeping your interest in by enticing you with his abstract, and sharp color, as well as reminding you that if you look away, you might miss something--and certainly you might. As the film trails on, you are left to develop theories and ideas, knowing full well that your guess is as good as the person sitting next to you. There are jump cuts, quick edits, and long meditative shots on such beautiful starlets as Scarlett Johansson. This may be Nolan's technique for distraction as the background may very well be giving you the big reveal. The plot grows intensely complicated (the posters aren't kidding when they admonish you to watch closely) and sometimes strains credibility (fake beards come into play a little too often), but faithful viewers will be richly rewarded by the clever ingenuity on display.Nolan keeps it all together with the same tricks that have made his previous films so enjoyable: clever story development and focus upon character. Like Memento, The Prestige utilizes a complex editing style, cutting back and forth between eras to create a cinematic texture of misdirection and revelation (high regards should also go to editor Lee Smith for an extraordinary job). The results draw us close to the central figures, then let us watch in rapt fascination as their wounds and desires drag them down. A few problems and inconsistencies do arise -- places where plausibility strains or the twists become repetitive -- but like the characters on-screen, Nolan is so good at guiding our attention elsewhere that we soon forget such problems. His leading men give him plenty of help. Bale's knack for evoking the dark side is well established, but it's sublime watching Jackman turn his immense charm towards sinister ends (this is easily his best film performance to date). Both make excellent use not only of their characters' strengths, but also their fears and insecurities, which retain an ounce of humanity even as they seek new parts of their souls to sell.There is a lot to here to be creeped out by, especially when the end comes around. The darkness became so overwhelming to me that I had a hard time shaking it soon after. It made me fearful again of what humans are capable of and reminded me that there is still much to be learned about the dark side of the human psyche. The Prestige does earn high praise not just as a terrific historical thriller, but also because it grasps the medium's links to this subject so remarkably well -- just like Welles, Hitchcock, Wilder and all those other great filmic magicians whose ranks Nolan is well on his way to joining."
" Brilliantly written and executed
",,"I heard from a friend who saw this that this was the most brilliant made movie she had ever seen, and she couldn't seem to emphasize that enough. That was enough to get me to see it in the theater (which i rarely do). This was easily worth the price of admission. The plot line is genius and keeps the viewer guessing what will happen next. Even if you guess one of the twists in this movie, you will probably find that you overlooked 1 or 2 more that you didn't see coming at all! This movie was so good, I went to the theater two days later and saw it again. It's wonderful the second time, too. Maybe about as good as the first time. I noticed more and more very smart aspects of the movie the second time that I didn't catch the first. I didn't know it was a Christopher Nolan film (Memento, Batman Begins) until after I watched it, which didn't surprise me as his work has always impressed me in the past, and continues to. If you haven't yet seen this, go see it!!! you wont regret it!"
" A mixed bag of tricks.
",,"The Good: Great plot twists, very cool magic tricks, and of course, Michael Caine.The Bad: Three alternating time lines is confusing most of the movie, some of the twists are easy to spot before they are revealed.Too Small: The role of Scarlett Johansson's character.Any movie about magicians has to satisfy one cardinal rule: have lots of magic tricks to totally dazzle the audience. The Prestige follows this with true style, and the first time you see Alfred (Bale) perform his trick, ""The Transported Man,"" your jaw will be hanging down as you think, ""how the hell did he just do that?"" It's moments like that that make this movie lots of fun to watch, but you will certainly long for more than they give you, taking into account the length of the movie. At two hours and twenty-one minutes, it's like a roller-coaster going at half-speed. Sure, there's thrills, but it still leaves everyone hungry for a boost in the pace. Probably the best (and worst) example of this is a moment in the film's finale when, as a certain character dies, his last breath seems to come out twenty different times for him to spit out a Shakespearian soliloquy before he finally croaks. You can practically hear everybody in the theater thinking the same thing: ""Just die already!"" Before you check this movie off of you ""must-see"" list, however, take into account that despite the length, this movie is quite entertaining. The story of two competing magicians seems like it might be as dry as a bone, but the grudges that Alfred and Robert (Jackman) hold against each other are not just about pride; they are genuinely driven by heart and soul. It's easy to see how much these to guys hate each other, and don't worry about not knowing why, because you'll find out within the first half hour of the movie.As far as performances go, not enough can ever be said about Michael Caine. His brilliance as an actor steals ever scene he's in. Jackman has probably had his best performance thus far in his career, except maybe for Swordfish. Bale is terrific as always, bringing every part of Alfred right into your face. Scarlett Johansson also does a great job, but her role was far too small, and at the end of the film you'll be wondering why her character, Olivia, wasn't explored a little more.When you actually do go out and see the movie, a fit of confusion is going to come over you quickly, possibly lasting into the last 40 minutes. It's not the plot twists that will confuse you; those are pretty ambiguous, and many people will call them out before they are revealed. No, the way this movie hurts your brain is with its three time lines, which alternate between scenes. In the beginning, Robert is dead, and Alfred is going to prison. Then, all of a sudden, they are young, up-and-coming magicians. And before you know it, we're with Robert in Colorado, as he tries to find the secret behind Alfred's greatest magic trick. Sometimes, you will think that these time lines come in sync with each other, but I'll save you a lot of of confusion right here: they don't."
" A confusing yet brilliant work of art...
",spoiler,"This was the first time I've been to the movies in a long time. I wasn't really planning on seeing this until a week before it came out when I saw it's trailer and me and my cousin thought it looked pretty cool.The movie never really gets boring at all. It is very clever. However, I must say that unless you pay extreme attention-as if it were a magic trick-you will be very confused. This movie cuts back and forth and goes all over the place. I mean, you really have no clue what it all means until the end...when they explain it.Apart from that, this is a wonderful movie. Christian Bale and Hugh Jack man are two of the greatest actors I've ever seen. And Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors I've ever seen. He was able to take a film that could have been boring and stupid and made it into an awesome film. I mean, while watching a magic show is cool, a movie based on how magic tricks are done doesn't sound very appealing to me. However, this movie proves that wrong and gives the audience an exciting ride.Because of the language and a few sexual references, I would not recommend this movie for children under the age of 10. But even if you are a parent who doesn't care about that stuff, your child is likely to fall asleep because he won't understand a single thing that is going on.There is always that point in the year that starts in August and goes all the way through the end of October, that not one appealing movie comes out. At least, not for me. Well, as we move into the Christmas season, the movies are starting to get better and better, and I'm sure more reviews will start coming in. This movie was the perfect movie to kick off this new season of good movies. If they keep getting better, the Oscars will be very tough."
" What a movie!!! Just Excellent
",,"Oh where do i begin! I knew this is a good movie. I knew it is gonna be tricky. So i watched tentatively from the start, and i just couldn't blink or exhale. This is one good movie and definitely worth the money to watch.The story is unique, different and very interesting. Not only about magic and complicated tricks. It is also about the complex human emotions that are beautifully portrayed by a great cast. Acting form each individual was very convincing. There were few moments when camera movement was a little irritating and unstable, but all in all.. close to perfect.In short, the movie is interesting and is like nothing i have seen before. It is definitely worth watching in the cinema... may be twice. And it is definitely worth buy the DVD. I hope they will make a presentable box set for this great movie."
" Awesome sleight-of-hand
",spoiler,"Magic tricks and cinema share a lot of properties with each other in several ways, the two biggest being the way of leading an audience along towards a surprise and focusing the audience on a distraction while using sleight of hand to conjure up something surprising. They both have a long history in perceptions, demons, and the occult. They're both logical when revealed, and yet despite such revealing audiences are willing to return to see a show over and over and over again.These days it's no special deal to try and trick the audience... Mr. Shyamalan has decided to permanently affix his career to it. Unfortunately, sometimes the attempt to out-dazzle the audience (and thus sell tickets) leads in a lack of performance from the magicians responsible. In this case, however, everyone throws in their due and we're treated to a stage that's absolutely magical.I've never previously understood why people put so much stock into Christian Bale--I saw that he was good but I didn't think he was fantastic--until now. I'd say he's the sole reason to go see this movie, if it wasn't for Hugh Jackman's acting. I can't speak of either in terms of actor/supporting actor... there is no difference between their importance, and this movie is so full of doppelgangers you might as well just sit back and be prepared to see double. The two of them are amazing.Nolan has definitely evolved as a director and shows it here with a much more hidden role. He's definitely the Man behind the Curtain and not self-conscious in his directing, and this film's use of broken chronology is much more structurally sound than Memento and other out-of-order works. In this case, its hardly noticeable--I only realized that I didn't have difficulty following the plot back and forth AFTER I left the theatre.And the stage in which this movie is set is spectacular as well. The world is enticing with its intrigue and the many obsessive characters; I especially like the side story about Tesla and Edison, one that's only hinted at but that a short research into history of electricity will help reveal more depth to this already double-deep movie. David Bowie as Tesla was an odd choice... I hardly even noticed it was he.It's a very enjoyable movie and pretty spectacular in its own right.--PolarisDiB"
" Absolutely Wonderful!
",,"The best kinds of movies are movies that will make you think and that you'll continue to talk about even after the picture ends, I went with my family and we talked about the movie even days after it ended, We're definitely going to go and see it again, it's a complete delight and will keep you on the edge of your seat even though it's a very long movie. There are so many plot twists and it will keep your mind spinning long after you finish watching it again, and once you see it you'll want to see it over and over again. I had no idea that this was previously a book and now I'm desperate to read it. Bale, Jackman and Johansen are wonderful actors and did a speldid job with their characters, giving them depth and three dimentions you'll have trouble deciding who to root for!"
" Christopher Nolan's brilliant MAGIC act.
",,"""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary some thing do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" - Christopher Nolan.The above quote is yet another example of a case of delicate and extraordinary screen writing. Guess what, this movie stands to its expectations raised in first few minutes. This is not just about magic but the life behind the acts. As Cutter (Michael Caine) narrates above quotes we see a magician performing on stage. A strange thing happens during his act (which of course I am not going to spoil) which takes you right to the core of what this story is all about. That opening scene creates a lot of questions. But interesting as it has been it makes you create your own theories. Its for you to find out what happens next.This is a story about Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman)and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) who are working as assistants for a magician Michael Caine. Every single act they watch of their own master and other magicians, they become curious about the acts and try and break those in their heads. As the story continues the situations arise when they rival against each other. That turns into a quest. A quest for the creation of the greatest magic act ever. All you have to do is just sit back and enjoy this unbelievable ride into the world of MAGIC.First accolade for the movie goes to Christopher Nolan, who was my immediate favorite the day I watched ""Following"". He has an uncanny ability to present. He is a master story-teller. The movie has a lot of pace. Though I saw the twist an hour earlier but it rather made me look for an explanation and Nolan has one that fits right in. He gives yet another fantastic screenplay after Memento and Batman Begins. Non-linearly written, based on Jonathan Nolan's short story, this saga glues you to your seat.The performances were fine. Especially Christian Bale. His acting gives this project a real life. This movie shows us his talent beyond the action scenes of Bruce Wayne' other half. Hugh Jackman wasn't far behind him. He delivers his performance with much intensity as well. Their rivalry keeps you guessing and thinking all the time. Next up is Michael Caine. He fits quite admirably in the character of Cutter. Singing legend David Bowie is memorable in his short performance as Tesla. Scarlett Johansson looks stunning as usual.This movie is dark, tricky, illusionary, intense and of course has something that I have never seen before. Applause to Mr Nolan."
" A marvelously intricate construction.
",spoiler,"Christopher Nolan's previous films show him to be a master of plotting and misdirection, even in a relatively straightforward superhero film like ""Batman Begins."" Here, with Batman and Wolverine headlining his production (Batman, amusingly, plays a character named Alfred), he weaves another elaborate mystery set in Victorian Britain, as two stage magicians vie for prominence (when I first heard about this film, it reminded me of the novel ""Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell"", which was set in the Regency). Bale and Jackman bring little trace of their previous roles (especially Jackman), and have able support from Michael Caine, Scarlett Johanssen (in a rather throwaway part), and Rebecca Hall. However, the real surprise of the film is an astonishing performance from David Bowie as inventor Nikola Tesla; Bowie is incredible in this part, and one almost wishes for a movie about him. Much like a J.K. Rowling novel, the delight of this movie is the way in which Nolan scatters numerous clues to what is really going on through the proceedings, only to pull out a series of fantastic plot twists the cast a whole new light on everything we've see happen previous to this. There are several huge twists at the end of this film, any one of which alone would seem to be enough, until Nolan contorts the plot again, and things still hold together. I highly recommend this stellar production."
" Absolutely wonderful movie
",,"When I first went into the theater, it was to see ""Employee of the Month,"" however I am really glad I chose to see ""The Prestige"" instead. This movie can be a little confusing at times, but it makes a lot of sense at the very end. It includes several plot twists and is a thought- compelling movie. My friend and I discussed ""The Prestige"" for at least a half hour. The plot is very good. The only flaw with this movie was that it could become confusing because of the time shifts. The time-jumps were needed in order to inform the viewer of the entire story, but it can leave a few people feeling confused. I don't really wanna expose the ending, which is why I'm not writing much about the plot. The actors' performances were great, and they included a lot of passion in their work. I would definitely say that if you've got money to go see a movie, ""The Prestige"" should be on your list, if not #1."
" Not a feel good movie but a VERY good movie
",spoiler,"I heard someone say that he wished the special effects were better but that was not what this movie was about. I thought they were very good considering the years in which it took place. I hoped until the end...I thought they were very clever but so misguided. Both actors were so good, so cold. The decors were splendid, nothing to overwhelm the eyes, so we could stay focused on the story. Aahhh! The story!!! I will not comment on it, it was very well done. Some tricks still keep me guessing but the story was very well laid out.Rebecca Hall was incredible (don't know her) but Scarlett was bland (sorry, very pretty but bland)and Piper Perabo was very good, livelier. And Michael Caine!!! Oh Wow!! I expected the usual but not this.A mind is a tricky thing and I always say ""Great minds think alike"", well in this case, it was true. The greatness was in their wickedness and deception power and none could enjoy the power they had. They could not even take pleasure from it.But don't take my comment from granted and make your own opinion."
" Give This Film Time to Sink In...
",,"Leaving the theater, I thought the film was just okay. An hour later, I thought it was pretty clever. And now, the next day, I think it was amazing. Why the change? It took that long for most or all of the subtle hints to sink in and the real twists to be discovered. The film doesn't end when you leave, it begins.The story is the tale of two magicians in a bitter rivalry, always trying to do a better trick than the other and trying to sabotage the other's success. At least, that's what you think the story is until you finally see ""the prestige"".I can't discuss much of this film because giving almost anything at all away would ruin some of the fun. But a few notes: Christian Bale, as always is awesome. An incredible actor with a wide range and screen appeal. Christopher Nolan works well with him (see ""Batman Begins"") and I hope they continue this Burton-Depp relationship they have. I foresee only greatness.Hugh Jackman is also spectacular, probably giving the most diverse performance in the film, easily the most demanding. And he does this convincingly.Scarlett Johannson is Scarlett Johannson... if you've liked her before, you should like her here (though her role never really gets the full story it needs). And David Bowie... wow, he is so much better than ""Labrynth"" would have you believe.The visuals are stunning, but the real credit goes to the makeup department, who deserve an Oscar for this picture. Outside of horror films where extensive makeup is often required, this film probably does more to change the actors' appearances than any other film I've ever seen. And I was going along with the ride the whole time.If you see one film from 2006, see ""The Departed"". But if you see two, ""The Prestige"" better be on your list."
" excellent
",,"Without a doubt one of the best movies I have seen in recent years. where to begin? Surprisingly the best performance I thought came from David Bowie as the émigré to America N. Tesla. His struggles with English were the only governor to his genius. All the rest Bale,Jackman performed very well. I would give the edge to Bale as he perhaps had the more challenging role. Michael Caine comes to each role now with an accumulation of experience that makes his performances as taken for granted as richly designed tapestry unnoticed until you consciously examine the weave,cut,and design. Perhaps the only disappointment as far as acting goes is from Scarlet Johannson's performance although in looks as always she is a delight for the eyes. Obviously,to say too much about the movie risks spoiling it. The concept was original. The movie itself 'mirrors' the three parts of a magic trick. Needless to say the third part of the movie ""the prestige will not disappoint. Bill Hash"
" Fantastic
",,"The Prestige was incredibly well-made, and I for one was thoroughly entertained. There's so much to analyze and pick apart with this movie that I'll probably be talking about it for the next month. I'm not going to waste time with much of a synopsis or spoiler. The movie works best I think the less you know about it going in. Just know that The Prestige is about an obsessive rivalry between two great magicians. Also, you should know that the writing was crisp and clever (must have been quite a chore to adapt), the directing was masterful (the structure of this movie is just as complicated as Momento-probably more so) and the acting (particularly Christian Bale) was spot-on. Highly recommended, particularly if you like Nolan's other films."
" I'm surprised yet not at all shocked ...
",,"At the professional critical reviews that ""The Prestiege"" has been garnering. To claim that The Nolan Brothers have under-written or half-directed this movie, or that ANY of the players on screen gave less than stellar performances is as great an injustice as walking out on the film halfway through or before it's wonderful climax. In fact, I'm convinced that some of the critics may HAVE done just that!! Sure, some of the ""twists"" are a bit predictable for the above average cinema sleuth, but overall, there is a very clear dichotomy between the audiences in the film watching the ""magic"" on stage wanting to believe it is real, and the audience in the theaters watching this film and wanting to believe that the magic ISN'T real.This film is easily the best I've seen this calendar year, and The Nolans are quickly rising to the upper eschelon of my favorite filmmakers. Again, wonderful, layered performances from all of the involved cast, and beautiful set design and cinematography all around. If you're a fan of any of the above, or haven't seen a great mystery/suspense thriller with twists and turns that simply IMPLORE you to stuff more popcorn in your mouth to stave off the anticipation of ""how did they do that!?"" then this is a SURE BET for you."
" Beautiful!
",,"I saw flags of our fathers, what i consider to be a very mediocre film, but as far as the reviews have been going this past week, it's virtually the only film i knew had come out. I saw a preview for The prestige and decided to go, and I was so glad i did. Besides the flawless acting and triumphantly consistent tone, the movie strikes on you on a few different levels. It portrays all aspects of our lives in general-- our sacrifices and the prestige we sacrifice for. What are you willing to give up for greatness? GO SEE THIS FILM! I have not been satisfied by a film in so very long, although i recently saw the departed which was indeed a kickass film, but Nolan's style is so magnificent-- its totally encaptivating, and I just had so much fun at this movie."
" Three Parts Of A Magic Trick
",,"The Pledge:Christopher Nolan, the brilliant man who brought us Memento and Batman Begins and soon The Dark Knight, brings us The Prestige. Starring Hugh Jackman, Wolverine from the X-Men movies and soon to have his own film, and Christian Bale, Batman in Batman Begins and The Dark Knight and Patrick Bateman from American Psycho. The movie is about two rival magicians Rupert and Alfred, Jackman and Bale respectively.The Turn:Their rivalry is something more than two competitors. It becomes about revenge. Eventually one of them discovers an amazing trick. Soon the other becomes obsessed with finding the secret. Everything he does becomes about finding the secret to the first trick. Later he finds an even better trick. A trick so astounding that not even the man who builds most of the tricks can understand it.The Prestige:Trusts are broken. Loyalties are tested. Loves are lost. Watch the movie carefully. This one requires you to pay attention and follow along. The movie is told in a non-linear format, even more so than Memento. There are subtle clues in almost every scene. This is no movie to text-message, make out, talk with friends, or even go to the bathroom during. Each and every scene helps to build to this mystery of what's going on. Missing one scene means certain confusion. It's not something you can half pay attention to. Even if you do pay attention you might just have to see it again just to see all the build up to the final trick.The Response:Amazing. Though if you found Memento confusing you may want to skip this one. But if you're a Christopher Nolan fan or always like a good mystery you will be sure to enjoy this one. Enjoy this one while you can. Movies with this level of excitement do not come around too often."
" Borden (Tesla) vs Angier (Edison)
",spoiler,"Great movie with Great actors writers and twists.Something that i didn't see anybody said about it that rivalry between two magicians is reference to Tesla and Edison's rivalry.
In the beginning they worked together, then became opponents. I think Borden is Tesla cause he always was more talented than Angier (Edison) who stole Borden's idea.Surely on of the best movies in this century, be sure to watch it more than one time."
" Awt Good
",,"The defending good and have a fantasy. Accommodate is required, injuries for the great analyticated days. Because a twoed man a showed to a all in just one session."
" The twist at the end keeps you guessing
",spoiler,"Focusing in on this Nolan not only provides a great tense and entertaining story of two performers struggling bitterly to make the other question his reality and his perception of it, but the director also makes us question the reality of the film and the performance of the stars."
" Great film
",,This film is one of my top 5 films of all time. Great acting and plot and twist. One of Nolan's best films.
" The best movie
",,Thid movie is my favorite movie. This movie change my life.
" That storyline uffff
",,Daamnnn never knew a movie could go this deep the storyline is amazing the actors are amazing everything's perfect about it
" Excellent movie. Read below for my interpretation.
",spoiler,"This movie has 2 correct explanations. That's right. You can choose to believe either one.The first explanation is that Angier was given a cloning machine by Tesla.
The second explanation is a little more complicated. According to that this isn't a sci-fi film. There's no ""clone."" Tesla was buying duplicate hats and cats to trick Angier into thinking it was a clone and that the machine worked so he'd keep funding it, but Angier eventually figured it out. Angier realized that he had a much better use for his wealth: hire several doubles. Six specifically. Each would have to die (unbeknownst to them) after every run of the trick lest the secret be revealed. Angier had to kill each one. It's why his run of the trick (after the practice run where he shot the first double) was limited to just 5 shows - he could only find so many doubles.Remember: no one cares about the man in the box. So be sure he's the one you kill, or the one your rival wants to kill. It's the same as with the bird. Either you kill it or your rival does in his efforts to sabotage you.Also, remember the lines early in: ""Never lose control of your magic trick."" If the machine were creating actual clones, the control would be lost (what do they decide to do, where do they show up). No, those are hired doubles. Plus, the film would be legitimately terrible to use such a bad and impossible 1950s sci-fi gimmick (cloned via simple electricity with the exact clothes and memories? Ummm. Ok)."
" A giant movie !
",,The best movie I have seen in my life. Movie that inspired me and I cannot imagine my life without it
" what a prestige really!
",,"Usually when I watch something that is longer than two hours I always feel like the timing is too much even if I liked the movie. But here I didn't even feel how the hours passed! This amazing cinematography, brilliant acting and original story captured my mind for two hours straight and then left me with an open mouth at the end. I swear, this movie deserves even a higher rate. It's marvelously good. Struggle for victory, obsession of the lead characters to be the best and let's not forget, there's twist and excitement all over the place, The Prestige has everything to be a masterpiece. And it is. I'm doing you a favor by saying you should watch it! You don't wanna miss this.9.5/10"
" Why I gave it a 10.
",,"First of all I am kinda bias because I am a magician, but it is also because it shows the struggles magicians go through. Keep in mind they are overdoing the struggles, but having to do what they did are real things that happen sometimes as a magician. I really enjoyed it and anybody who likes magic should really watch it just do not try any of the tricks."
" Both a Natural and Supernatural Mystery
",,Both a natural and supernatural mystery. One might expect one but not the other. Excellent cast. Great premise. But the reveal was both anticipated and obscured as the lines of the genres were blurred. I'll leave you to figure out this riddle. I give this film a 7 (good) out of 10. {Mystery Drama}
" What makes a good magic trick?
",,"I like magic tricks. Even as a kid I knew they weren't real, but it didn't stop me from admiring the skill and the how-did-they-do-that moment right after the prestige, the final act of a magic trick. It's a kind of awe. But the success of a magic trick is based on the audience not understanding how what just happened, happened. Every magician knows this, which is why they're wary to reveal how a trick is done.And that's the problem with The Prestige. The movie is about dueling magicians and is in itself a magic trick. There are twists, double-twists, surprise characters, we don't have all the pieces, or do we, no we don't, yes we do, another twist, and then the end happens -- and Christopher Nolan reveals how the whole narrative trick was constructed, step by step. It's as if a magician just did the most amazing trick you've ever seen and then spends the next ten minutes explaining how exactly he did it. It's disappointing, deflating. Instead of feeling wowed, we feel let down. We could talk about the other elements in the film, like the acting or directing or set design, but all these are subservient to the mystery, and in the end there is no mystery; had the ending been more ambiguous I would've rated this movie higher. I've seen every Nolan film, and this is the weakest by far."
" Brilliantly crafted movie!
",,"This movie leaves you thinking and admiring its intricate details even hours after you have watched it. Mind blowing to say the least. Such an engaging and captivating story, and the acting is top notch."
" I really wanted to love it but .. alas
",spoiler,"Unfortunately I noticed Fallon was Bordens' twin/look-a-like early on in the movie so that's one of the two plot twists ruined. And as someone else mentions, we literally see Tesla's 'cloning machine' works so it's obvious how that will pan out, with Angier(s clone) getting out alive & Borden (although it seems it's Fallon, aka the angrier twin) being hanged.
Another thing I did not appreciate was Scarlett's accent, and maybe it's because i'm a Londoner, but i found it jarring.
I appreciate there was more to this movie than the plot twists, it was beautifully shot and I personally enjoyed performances by the two main actors and by the late Bowie but yeah, their obsession came to be a little tiresome."
" Perfection !!!
",,"One of my favorite films and one of my favorite actors starring in it. The film is one of the best movies that in ever created about magic. The movie perfectly gives the atmosphere of the 19th century in London. The clothes the environment, everything is great. also the plot is very interesting and appealing. One of the things that I adore about this movie is that it hast a twisted plot. You can watch it hundreds of time, but you will never fully understand the film and with every time you watch you find a new detail that you have not seen before which adds to your understanding of the film's idea.
In one word, this movie has everything. The action, the intrigue, the fear, the magic, the betrayal, everything. It has interesting plot and one of the best actors. And I will recommend everyone watching it."
" The best movie of my life

No matter what genre you prefer it is a must watch"
" Un predictable

" Do you believe in Magic?
",,"The Prestige: 9 out of 10: Two magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) develop a deadly rivalry that threatens them both.Some days I don't get critics. This is a fantastic film with a wonderfully twisty story, incredible acting, and excellent period detail. Yet it sits at a 75% on Rotten Tomatoes. One of Christopher Nolan's worse as director. The bloated Dark Knight Rises sits at an 87%It is a bit of a head-scratcher. It did come out during particularly good run of films in the theater ( Scorsese's The Departed, Eastwood's Flags of our Fathers) and it wasn't the only costume drama attacked that weekend (Sofia Coppola's Marie Antoinette was savaged by critics) Some people didn't like the end but I think it is more than a bit brilliant. One caveat is that I did like the film more on repeat viewings after a little time had passed. I can see how the initial reaction might be slightly harsher.Still, The Prestige has easily recovered and sits comfortably in the IMDB top 250 a couple of spaces from The Departed. (Time has not been as kind to Flags of our Fathers which is all but forgotten.... However, Marie Antoinette has also picked up some fans over the years and is bordering on a cult classic.)I am not talking about The Prestige simply because I don't want to spoil it. It is that good and should be seen with fresh eyes. Okay, one more hint it has the second best David Bowie casting ever."
" Are you looking closely?
",,"The Pristage is a great fantasy drama film, that keeps you engaged to the very end. Once you have finished the film, you will want to watch again immediately to see what clues you missed after the surprise ending. I love this unique and well made film. Nolan is such a great film maker. He always seems to cast the right actors for his films. This movie plays with your imagination and keeps you guessing towards the very end of the film. I think this is one of Nolan's underrated films, but it definitely does not disappoint."
" Great Performances
",,"Continuing my plan to watch every Hugh Jackman movie in order, I come to his 6th and final movie of 2006, The Prestige.Plot In A Paragraph: After a tragic accident, two stage magicians engage in a battle to create the ultimate illusion while sacrificing everything they have to outwit each other.I watched this for the first time a few weeks ago!! With great performances, a second twist I never seen coming, I really enjoyed this movie.It's not perfect, far from it, but I was engaged throughout, and at the end, I recommended it to a friend.Prestige grossed $53 million at the domestic box office to end the year, as the 61st highest grossing movie of the year."
" A twist too far...
",,"The movie is great, no doubts. Almost each element is perfect: filming, acting, pace, atmosphere.. The only flaw, imho, is the number of twists. There are movies that a single one does a fine job (e.g. The Entitled, 2011). But enough is enough, and Nolan serves even more. Otherwise the only fair note would be 10/10."
" EXCELLENT,OUTSTANDING,MINDBLOWING,STUNNING!!!!
",,This is the perfect example of what a prolific nolan can do the plot is an absolute smasher hugh jackman and christian bale have acted excellently and the movie doesn't feel as if it is getting stretched it is the perfect example of a blockbuster movie

" A Tight, Compelling Drama
",,"22 October 2006. The script is tight, covering almost all of its bases along with a tense and character-driven drama surrounding loss and revenge, prestige and sacrifice. While the relational dramas unfolding appeared somewhat chaotic, part is explained by the plot itself. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale provide was wonderful performances as well as the mysterious David Bowie as Mr. Tesla as an added bonus. There are a few harsh magical moments. The flashbacks are handled nicely without obvious ostentation except where appropriate for the character and context. The ambiguity of Jackman's and Bale's characters is also commendable. Overall, this is a fine movie, but there are a few editing jumps and a bit of underdevelopment of characters that could have provided full-rounded enjoyment. However, such trifles could come down to deliberate necessity because of the plot twists. A surprisingly eerie, compelling delight. Eight out of Ten Stars."
" What a Cast! What a Challange!
",,"Unpredictable scenario, great characters such as Alfred Boden and Insane plays. Firstly the cast shows everything about film . The cast says "" Watch me "" . After all there is a enormous challenge between Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. Who will win? Watch and Learn"
" Truly a masterpiece
",,"Such an underrated piece of art. Nolan's The Prestige presents so much, and yet, so little praise is given to this film. It's Shakespearean in many ways; hubris is the main focal point of the story and if you look closely, you may relate to this often cautionary tale of obsession, anger and blind ambition.This is also another one of his movies where he leaves so much up to interpretation, without shoving it in your face or being pretentious.A beautiful spellbinding film on the level of Hitchcock. Why Nolan has been snubbed at the Oscars so many times is a mystery. He's one of the greatest directors in film history."
" Great film

" Magical, Mystical Tour - The Prestige
",,"Such films as The Illusionist, Houdini and The King of Masks and others have all done excellent jobs with the subject of magic. The Prestige deserves to be right up there with those classics. I love magic and films about them, and I was not disappointed in this one. The King of Masks is my favorite all time magic film. This film comes close; the performances are impeccable, the direction is on the nose, and the production values are first-rate. The screenplay is erudite, and should be appreciated by the intelligent viewer. The really great magician in this film is neither of the leading actors, however. It is Tesla, one of the greatest scientific minds of all time; hounded by the heinous Thomas Edison, a person we were taught to revere in school. It is only now, in the information age, that we have found out what a despicable person Edison really was. There is no relation to reality and the Spencer Tracy film about Edison. He was a criminal. But the film is about magic, not criminal acts, or even Tesla (although we surely could use a good film about him). If you have even a passing interest or appreciation of good magic, then this film is for you. Enjoy."
" Review on movie
",,"One can relate to this personal human struggle for victory over another at all costs on a much grander scale, as the two magicians could easily be symbolic of how leaders of countries come to blows with each other, at the expense of their women and children -- something we struggle with right now in our world. There are deeper layers of this film that will be uncovered over time. The movie was well acted, interesting, entertaining, visually stunning and the twist at the end was surprising. The Prestige definitely is one of the best movies about magicians. I found out about this movie on flickstree and flickstree is really good and helpful in finding movies of our choice."
" The illusion of perfect
",,"""The Prestige"" is a film that takes a middle hit it and makes it very unique, with a great script, complex, yet exciting and mysterious time, the film surprises at times, ""Look closer"" is a phrase which is repeated in the film sometimes seems that Nolan puts it in the script to speak directly to the viewer, ""look closer,"" that's what you need to do look more and close as the movie is full of subliminal tips what's the big trick, you need to pay attention and be surprised, moreover, it is worth noting the fine performances of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, as well as Scarlett Johansson and Michael Caine, and even with a weak soundtrack and a dark picture, and costumes and simple screen elements, he convinces the film also touches on the subject of the obsession of the human being to be the best, no matter how expensive cost it, and in this respect Nolan is almost perfect, something lacking in the obsession of the characters , perhaps the fact that they are directly linked obsession with reason. In addition to showing the historical Tesla, we see a little about the world of illusions from the late eighteenth century, such a surreal way that now seem magical, talking about magic, it's cool as the film makes clear that the real magic is the science and that the obsessions are not worth the price of those we love. The film and good surprises the script and performances, but is otherwise common to conservative means too much for a movie about magic and illusionism."
" A masterpiece from Nolan
",,"This movie isn't the only unique narrative that has come from Nolan. Among the most known are obviously Interstellar and Inception. However, in my opinion 'The Prestige' takes the cake. It tells the story of two stage magicians driven by rivalry, hopes of fame, money and happiness.The movie starts off by explaining the three elements of a magic trick. 'The Pledge', or the ordinary, 'The Turn', or the extraordinary done by the ordinary, and 'The Prestige', the essence of the extraordinary (also called the reveal). The movie itself is implicitly split into the three parts, with Nolan building up to the movie's own Prestige. In the Pledge, the movie introduces our primary characters - magicians Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) in London. The movie explores how the two magicians who start off as friends slowly end up at each other's throats due to a magic act taking the life of Angiers' wife, and the water escape artist Julia.The whole script is written in a series of flashbacks, and narrations from a diary which consistently misdirect the audience's concentration like an attractive assistant in a magic trick. The whole movie focuses on proving to the audience how we, as the spectators, like to be fooled by the trick, rather than figure out the trick itself. Nolan puts all clues in front of our eyes, starting with the hats, Borden's weird behavior, Borden's ingeniør's character, his continuously switching love interest and yet, the reveal is unpredictable and comes as a shock when it finally happens.Angier is the typical showman. He knows how to charm his audience, but lacks the technical prowess. Borden on the other hand, understands the nature of stage magic, but fails to understand how to sell his show using proper showmanship. It all starts when Borden's urge to try a new knot in the water escape trick causes the death of Angier's wife on stage. This causes a long series of hatred, jealousy and cheap tricks(sabotage, accusations and killings) between the two magicians now working alone.For a movie on magic to have the desired effect, the ambiance created within the movie needs to be very powerful. This has been done exceedingly well in the movie as well. All the stage costumes, the background music, their disguises, everything creates a spell of immersion for the audience to enjoy.In my opinion, The Prestige is a must watch movie for anybody who wishes to give his/her mind a jog."
" Watch closely.....
",,"The Prestige is an amazing movie. This film is sure to blow away any and all audience members. From the superb acting displayed in every single scene to the terrifically well thought out storyline and writing. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are 2 very gifted actors and that is ever present all throughout the prestige, they have impeccable chemistry between themselves and all the other co stars they are performing on screen with. Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca hall are great here too, they both gave focused, intense performances. The plot seems rather simple and like there is not much to it by simply reading it on IMDb, but not everything is as it seems ;). This film is full of so many twists and turns that you'll have to really really watch closely.... As any audience at a magic show would. The movie leaves you feeling amazed and rethinking the scenes in the movie, piecing it all together drawing conclusions. Christopher Nolan is a truly truly talented filmmaker, that becomes evident and obvious to any viewer of this movie. 10/10 for the prestige, it's not hard at all to see why it's in the top rated 150 films. Oh and a shout-out to Michael cane, killed it, as always."
" Rivalry and obsession in the world of magic
",spoiler,"This film tells the story of two rival magicians, Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, in late Victorian London. After a brief introduction we see Angier drown as a trick appears to have been sabotaged by Borden and the latter in put on trial for his murder but are things what they seem? The story then unfolds from the time they were friends to the final revelation concerning what really happened in that opening scene.Angier and Borden's friendship is irrevocably broken when Angier's wife is killed when a trick goes wrong; Angier is convinced that it was Borden's fault. The two go their own ways and put on rival magic shows. Angier sees a chance for revenge when Borden attempts the famous 'bullet catch' trick; he hides himself amongst the crowd then volunteers to be the man who pulls the trigger, slips a real bullet into the gun and pulls the trigger; Borden survives but loses two fingers. Time passes and Borden develops a new trick; 'The Transporting Man'. This seemingly impossible trick sees Borden enter one cupboard then emerge from another almost instantly. Angier is desperate to replicate the trick but can't figure out how it is done. His ingénieur (trick creator), Cutter, is certain that it must involve a double but Angier is certain that the only man on stage is Borden. He performs his own version, using a double but is unsatisfied; determined to learn the truth he sends his stage assistant, Olivia Wenscombe, to pretend to work for Borden to learn the secret; she steals his notebook but it is encrypted. Angier forces Borden to tell him the key word (Tesla) and this leads him to search out scientist Nikola Tesla in Colorado to get the equipment he needs this ultimately works but not in a way anybody would expect.Anybody familiar with the films of director Christopher Nolan will know to expect the unexpected and shouldn't be put off by the non-linear narrative it isn't just that the story is told in flashback; instead it moves back and forward revealing aspects of the story. This isn't just a gimmick as it works to make things interesting. The way the two magicians' rivalry escalates perfectly encapsulates their obsessions; not just to be the best but also to destroy the other. The cast does a fine job; most notably Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine who play Angier, Borden and Cutter respectively. They are ably supported by Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson as Borden's wife Sarah and Olivia Wenscombe, there is also an enjoyable cameo from the late David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. The final resolution is rather surprising; largely because it is blatant science-fiction rather than a magic trick this might disappoint some viewers although others will enjoy the dark twist when they realise the secret behind Angier's version of 'The Transporting Man'. Overall I'd certainly recommend this impressive and intriguing film."
" Negative
",spoiler,"i Hate the climax in ""Robert Angier"" Character. But bottom line of the story is simply awesome. Two stage magicians engage in competitive one-up man-ship in an attempt to create the ultimate stage illusion. That illusions are shown in beautiful manner.In 1878, two young stage magicians clash in a darkened salon during the course of a fraudulent seance. From this moment on, their lives become webs of deceit and exposure, secrets and revelations, as they feud to outwit and destroy one another. Their rivalry takes them both to the peak of their careers, but with terrible consequences.That every magic trick consists of three acts: (1) the Pledge, in which a seemingly real situation is set up, (2) the Turn, in which the initial reality is challenged, and (3) the Prestige, where all is set right again."
" this is a prestigious watch
",,"The Prestige is another excellent work of Christopher Nolan , the script is smart and great , the cast is great , Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are great , the rivalry of the two is very well made in the film, and motivations are good, the track sound is great, and the picture and very good , the film some special effects, and the little that is used are good , the film has great moments , especially in the magic show, and the Nicola Tesla is in the film , and it is important the plot of the film , the Prestige only proves that every film Nolan is overcome creativity , Top 5 of the filmography of the director . Note 9.6"
" Another mind-boggler by Christopher Nolan
",,"As Christopher Nolan also directed Inception and Memento, it is no surprise that the Prestige is a complete mind-boggler. The Prestige is a great film because it is multi-layered, intricately written and demands the full attention of the viewer. It often cross-cuts back and forth between two separate narratives, which means you need to be completely engaged in the film or you'll end up confused. I've also never seen a film about magicians and showmanship before, so the Prestige opened up my eyes to a whole new film genre. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson were all great as the leads.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/4ZM11a"
" Beautiful but Empty
",spoiler,"I'm sorry but: While the period piece looks great and the plot is fairly twisted and keeps us guessing at what we are possibly missing, which should be entertaining. At the end of the movie we are left with a big why? OK, OK there is obviously the rivalry between the 'bad' twin played by Bale and the clone destroying Angier. And at the end they both lose pretty much everything they cared for coz of caring most for out competing each other. I'm left with scratching my head, if any sane person got his hands on a machine that could clone anything, why would they simply use it to kill their clones. Or if two twins really loved two separate women why would they agree to swap them among themselves for the sake of a useless plot device? Cost of playing a Chung_Ling_Soo like character all their life? I don't think so. Not to mention, what happened to the drunken double of Angier that outsmarted him?"
" Intriguing from start to finish
",,"The film opens up with a monologue by Michael Cain, surprisingly explaining how a magic trick or illusion is performed. Within minutes we are introduced to all the main character, which with nowadays movies, is rare. As the film unfolds the film seems to break and pull back the fourth wall, allowing the audience a ""behind the scene's"" if you will into the performance, forgetting that it's a film we are watching and not the performance. The acting and dialogue from all characters is second to none. The film leaves you deeply thinking with each scene , however the plot and ending (if you catch on early enough) are revealed during the opening to middle parts. A very well written, performed and spoken film from Christopher Nolan."
" beautifully presented.......
",spoiler,"what a way of presenting such a movie... Again a Christopher Nolan masterpiece. Scarlett Johansen gave an amazing performance. probably worthy of an Oscar though. movie goes slow but intrigues you into it. for me David bowie stole the show. was expecting more from bale and Jackman. two prolific name in a movie must make it truly special, but no they were not at their best... should be a must watch for everyone. giving 9 out of 10 only because of the writing, screenplay and directing. misses out 1 star though.. ha hawell this movie exceeded my expectations. i hope you will like it as well. the suspense kills you at the very end...again a nolan masterpiece"
" Excellent story, multi-layered, enjoyable, bears repeat viewing but far from perfect.
",spoiler,"I have a particular perspective on this movie, being myself a stage hypnotist. Whilst my art is quite distinct from that of illusionists such as are depicted in this movie (although I have performed as such also) the two fields do overlap and in the broadest common usage I am often referred to as a magician. Many aspects of the story I found to resonate with me on a personal level.I emphasise the story because that is what sustains this production. I have'nt read the original (though I have earlier work by the same author) but the screenplay sustains attention through what might otherwise be judged an overlong piece. To be frank, the movie starts slowly and dwells excessively on many scenes, some of which are irrelevant to the plot and could have been omitted with no loss. For example the one with the prank on the prison warder.The sets, photography, costumes, performances are all excellent but one would not sit through it just for those aspects. Until the story cranked up some momentum I regarded the movie as yet another to make jokes about rather than being engaged by. Indeed I chuckled when a magicians ""secret"" is revealed in mysterious seclusion as what appears to be a gigantic metronome with its cover on(it isn't, but looks like one). The slow start is not entirely the directors fault and in this respect the writing falls short of its overall quality. Deliberate humour is actually one thing entirely absent from the movie, which may be appropriate given the dark subject matter. However, the early parts, with a story told using intercut viewpoints and time-frames, flash-backs and flash-forwards is really rather confusing.There are sub-texts in the story which extend beyond the immediate tale itself and these are subtly flagged up in the script. The ambiguity of identity is only the most obvious theme. The best feature of the realisation only become apparent when one has already watched it and the metaphors hidden in plain sight throughout become retrospectively apparent. In a way, this is something of a magic trick in itself. Perhaps the attention spent on what I have suggested to be ""irrelevent"" scenes are after all a kind of mis-direction. A kind of magic!"
" A lecture on narrative
",,"The movie begins by letting the public know that in a magic trick there are three acts: -The premise, where we are shown an ordinary object, like a canary. -The change, where something extraordinary happens to this object. The canary disappears. But you don't clap yet, because you know that something else must happen, you are waiting for it.-Finally, in the prestige, the magician brings the ordinary object back. And that's when you clap. You think you are trying to figure out how he did it, but actually, you don't really want it. Because deep down you know that the old canary is smashed under the table.This is a narrative masterpiece, and we are being told what is going to happen straight from the beginning. Nolan takes an ordinary story of two magicians' rivalry; gives it an extraordinary plot twist, and while you are trying to figure out what is the trick behind it, he brings back the ordinary to the movie.But, just like in a magician's show, he needs to build up the tension. In a normal show, a magician begins with the simple stuff, something rather interesting yet nothing unique. Throughout the show, things get more amazing, until you get to the second to last trick, which you think it tops it all. But then it comes the last trick, the truly jaw dropping one; and you realize that the previous trick was simply the second best. A highly recommendable movie to pretty much anyone."
" fascinating
",,"a film about magic at different levels. the magic as art. the magic as axis of life. art as only way to survive. beautiful, mysterious, ambiguous and almost impeccable. in fact, brilliant job. and this status is result of delicate-precise mixture of acting, impeccable story, splendid atmosphere and the feeling than competition escapes from the screen. a seductive detail - David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, a role who gives to film a special flavor. at first sigh, story of a cruel fight for success. or a portrait of manipulation art. in fact, fresco of a time. and one of admirable roles for Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman."
" Ambition
",,"one of the greatest ruiner in life. The Prestige's main characters are full of it. One always trying to outdo the other, wanting to be better and feel superior. I always maintain a petty person, a person with a small ego tend to try to achieve more success than others. Whilst it can lead to great things being competitive it is only a few people that actually succeed. I kind of see this as a warning for the consequences of ambition, it reminds me of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were quite good in their portrayal of their characters, I found the characters to be unlikeable but I could still relate to their desperation. Their hunger for fame and prestige. Although I'm not the ambitious type. Hugh Jackman was smooth as he usually is and Christian Bale wasn't a robot half the time as when he was Batman in The Dark Knight trilogy. I can't believe that critics and viewers think Christopher Nolan's later movies are better than this. It is more honest about human nature in its portrayal. It shows the characters' dark sides without too much bull****. It is also dark, almost Gothic and not as sentimental as The Dark Knight. No hollow portrayal of light vs dark, just two humans driven by greed and desperation.One of the great things about this movie is it is about fooling the audience. Theater is about showing the whole machinery of theater, explaining how things work. With movies it is about tricking the audience and making its audience believe in the unbelievable. But since the movie centers around the stage and magic, it is a combination of both theater and cinema. Which fits well with Christopher Nolan's way of making movies. There is always a sense of Shakespeare behind his scripts, mostly it makes for a boring movie for me but here it actually worked. (Don't get me wrong, Shakespeare wrote great tragedies that are still copied to this day, he is very influential). I don't find his other works interesting, since he spends half the movie of making the movie explain itself to the audience. I often find it dull, because I often prefer not having the motivation behind characters, movie plot, plot elements and story to be explained. I prefer them being simply shown. This movie also spends a lot of energy explaining itself, but like I wrote earlier this movie is a mix of theater and cinema.Now I feel this is the only movie by Christopher Nolan to be worth a revisit. I didn't like it at first. At all. But it grew on me over the years and his movies does not usually grow on me. Maybe because it reminds me of Hans Christian Andersen's fairy tales. Whatever the reason I think this is a good movie. Although it is full of flaws (well like most movies are), but with a little suspension of disbelief this movie will do fine. A fine movie worth watching again."
" Industrial light & magic (rental)
",,"Well, i was reluctant to rent this movie as the story didn't appeal very much to my tastes : however, now, after watching it, i found it good, not exceptional or prestigious but better than the actual trend : Nolan is indeed a great director as he knew how to grasp my attention since the first minutes : The art direction is rather excellent with big theaters, stages and all the feel of the « Victorian » era. All the cast is at the same level : Wolvie, Batman, black widow Even the second parts are well filled : Perabo, Gollum, David Bowie, Michael Caine and for sure Rebecca Hall! The story is not as linear and simple as i feared : it's full of twists and flashbacks so we better pay attention and this competition between those two is rather violent, absolute and in a way, sad and tragic..."
" A Bit Love It or Hate It; I Love It
",,"Let us start with a quote from the film.""Every great magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The first part is called ""The Pledge"". The magician shows you something ordinary: a deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it to see if it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But of course...it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn"". The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it, because of course you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call ""The Prestige"". "" So says the opening narration of this movie. It's one of my favorite openings in film. Though film is a visual medium, I find that a good poetic speech every now and then can make more of an impact than many sweeping shots or well-choreographed action sequences. It's not a universal opinion, to be sure. But it is definitely one that I hold. Perhaps that's due to the fact that I am a writer to the deepest, darkest, most intimate corner of my heart and soul, as you can likely tell if you've read enough of these recaps.But if you want to talk about pure movie magic, look just to the content of the speech. Of course, it is about magicians, and it forms some detailed and resonantly captivating framework for the rest of the movie. But it could be easily construed as symbolism for the effect of movies and the movie-making process. Think about it. I did. You ground the audience in reality, take to the cinematic skies, and then stick your landing. I don't know if that was intentional. But it certainly is effective. Now, take a deep breath with me. And dive.Once again, I am an Nolaniac. If you want to call me a fanboy, so be it. You're wrong. Dead wrong. Damn wrong. In fact, I hate that term when it is applied to those smart and thoughtful who do not deserve it that it makes my blood boil. But I've been called worse. I... do have a tendency of going off on rants, don't I? Oh well. Whatever.But as a Nolaniac, I can safely say that this is the most Nolan-y of his movies, for better and for worse. I can safely say that there are 3 of his movies that even people who don't like his other movies or are indifferent to them all love. Those being TDK, Inception, and Memento. This is the 'measure movie', if you will. If you love this movie, you likely love Nolan movies. If you hate this movie, you likely hate Nolan movies. And if you're indifferent to this movie, you likely are indifferent to Nolan movies.The basic plot is simple enough, particularly for a Nolan movie: two magicians try to one-up each other. But this is not just a movie about magic; it's a film about pride, folly, showmanship, desperation, and the extents to which one will go to achieve their desires, even at the cost of their own sanity. Stylishly stunning with great acting and a gripping plot, it is one of modern cinema's great marvels as well a movie that wants to be seen time and time again.It may not be as haunting upon a second watching as Memento or as thematically resonant upon a second watching as TDK or as striking and impressive upon a second watching as Inception, it is the Nolan movie that I say reveals the most upon a second watching. Mostly due to the ending twist, which was... interesting, to say the least.Like Interstellar, I movie which I like alright but is probably Nolan's weakest to date, many of the people who hate this film hate it because of that ending. They feel like after the curtain was pulled up, there is nothing to witness. I disagree with them, but I do admit that they make a few good points.While it is not as big of a problem here as it is in the scientifically-minded Interstellar, the revelation of something that could conceivably called 'real magic' does mess with the tone of the film a bit. And it is not as sharp or thrilling or thought-provoking as many other Nolan movies, which is why I put in here on this list.Of course, I can't fail to mention that this film had a golden rating from me by the time they went to visit Tesla for the first time. Though I am a film critic first, I do say that I am not a cyborg (though that would be cool) and thus am not without feelings. And while the section is gritty and dark and accurate in its depiction of the landscape of the Old West and is objectively a high point, it is the combination of Tesla (one of my favorite scientists) and Colorado Springs (where I've lived since I was born) that permanently endeared this movie to me.Which brings me to my closing statements. This is a movie thematically about perception and like most Nolan movies, it runs along the tracks of its themes. So let me say this: your opinion of The Prestige wrests mostly on perception. If you are looking to bash on this movie, you will bash on it. If you are looking to adore this movie, you will adore it. And if you are looking with an open mind for an impressive film experience, you will not be disappointed."
" Amazing twists and great thriller!
",,"It was magic! An amazing Christopher Nolan thriller and a great drama. 130 minutes may seem long, but I did not even realize that I spent more than 2 hours when the film ended.The atmosphere was breathtaking, the costumes were original and represented the late 19th century quite well.Christopher Nolan used successful flashbacks; in every flashback you complete the pieces of the puzzle and your curiosity increases until you see the final scene.One last word for the performance of Hugh Jackman, it was spectacular, you really see that he feels his role deep inside his soul.Do not miss the magic, are you watching closely?"
" A Mind-Bending Psychological Thriller!!
",,"The Prestige is just one of the many Nolan movies that prove that he is one of the true cinematic geniuses in the world. A period film that is based on the life of two magicians, The Prestige, has all the ingredients that are necessary to challenge the viewers perception on what is truly happening. It has a narrative that is non-linear which makes it hard to pin down and fully understand the plot.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale star as the two magicians who are obsessed with proving the world who the better magician is. Both of them give charismatic, spellbinding performances that illustrate the depth of their rivalry and unyielding desire to perfect their craft.Christopher Nolan is one of the best directors in the world and the entire movie has his stamp of authority and he is in control of every aspect of the film. Even after a couple of viewings, it is difficult to fully understand the complicated plot.One aspect of the film that just does not live up to the standard is the music. It never manages to reach the heights that the cinematography had scaled. Apart from this, I would say that the only limitation that Nolan has is constructing strong female characters with substantial roles. In this movie as well, there is not much scope for the actresses to do something unique with their roles.However, if you are looking for a smartly made movie that constantly challenges the viewer and demands repeat viewing, then The Prestige will fulfill your needs."
" Where ambition can lead you..
",spoiler,"The Prestige follows two magicians over the course of their career. What started as a friendly rivalry turned into much more. Borden and Angier, the two main protagonists start off as stage hands to an experienced magician, but after a horrible accident in an illusion involving Angier's wife goes wrong and she ends up drowning. And so starts the battle between the two magicians, as the movie progresses through the years it shows just how desperate each one gets to outdo the other. Until one day Borden shows his audience his ""Transported Man"" trick, Angier's mind snaps. Little does he know that he's not really looking for the secret to Borden's trick, but trying hard to emulate and improve it. That's what the movie hides so well. The scenic landscape of Colorado and Colorado springs captured by excellent camera work helps bring the grandeur to the movie. It's not just the fancy footage filmed in the mountains and valleys that really make this film, it's the faithful recreation of late 19th century London which sets the dark undertone of the film. The inclusion of an all-star cast solidifies each character's performance and personality, especially the likes of Michael Caine and David Bowie. Obviously since this is a film about magicians, the ""what happens next?"" moment occurs quite frequently and it's not just limited to the tricks they perform. Music in a movie has always been extremely important to me. Fortunately in Nolan's flicks, one can find much to appreciate in how a certain suite or soundtrack really binds the scene together. Although the movie isn't noted for its soundtrack it was still important in completing the scenes. Nolan's movies sometimes have a tendency to have ""empty"" scenes, for me there were definitely a few scenes which I thought were just filler."
" Great story and characters make the slightly confusing storyline worth it.
",spoiler,"This is not a movie to be watched just for fun, but it is great fun to watch if you're willing to ""watch closely"" the entire time. It's a little confusing with the various timelines that I still don't have a perfect grasp on after seeing it twice, but it's not that hard to follow as Nolan films go even though you don't fully understand everything that's going on. The complexity of it will definitely make you want to see it again, but not because you can't follow it the first time around like Inception with all of the rules of the dream world.The two (or three) main characters of Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) drive the plot in their unrestricted battle. Their relationship is a little bit like that of Miguel and Tulio in El Dorado with the separate but equal partnership, but it is present more like the characters in Troy where everyone is the good guy and the bad guy at multiple points. We see both of their strengths, weaknesses, dark sides, and good qualities equally, leaving us to choose who to root for. Both men are good at heart, but their vengeful emotions and obsessive personalities lead them to do things that the audience knows they shouldn't do, but somehow, we know that they must. Michael Caine, as always, plays the voice of reason in the part of Cutter, the seasoned veteran magician who runs Angier and Borden's joint show. His voice over that dissects a magic act is a perfect compliment to the film. The lead female roles of Sarah, Julia, and Olivia provide a lot of motivation and sometimes means of Angier and Borden getting back at each other, but they all have importance and dignity. The magicians' relationships with their wives are where we really see that they are good, caring men underneath their obsessions. Sarah demands respect from Borden, which puts her a little ahead of her time with women's rights movements. Julia Angier isn't given as much depth because of her untimely death, but it's clear that Angier really suffers from losing her which is a plus for her character. Olivia adds a lot of depth to both men because she recognizes that they are ruled by their obsessions and knows that their trust in her shouldn't give her reason to trust them. Nikola Tesla and Gerald Root have a small parts, and are both really only important in advancing Angier's line.The plot is a little tough to follow since it's often hard to tell when some scenes take place, but if it gets confusing, just keep in mind that Angier and Borden's main two motivations are vengeance on each other and creating the ultimate version of the world's greatest magic trick. Part of the flashback confusion comes from the two reading each other's diaries at different times. It's possible, though difficult, to guess the ending, though that shouldn't affect how much you enjoy it. Regardless, it's a very strong story. I can understand how people think the story cheats by using Tesla's sci-fi invention, but the science element is incorporated proficiently enough that it works out well.The acting is about A to A- quality across the board. The script was phenomenal in my opinion, with lots of great lines that really stay with you even though they aren't very quotable. The costuming seemed pretty spot on, and the lighting was very well done in the different magic acts. The cinematography and camera work is spectacular at a couple of points like the first time we see Borden's trick and the shot of Angier as he listens to the applause while under the stage. The one technical point I would have changed is the slight overabundance of flashback scenes. Either they should have cut down on them or let you know that they were flashbacks a little better.If you like Nolan movies, a good story, or great characters, definitely put this on your list of things to watch. If you're looking for a group movie or something to just watch for the heck of it, look elsewhere. Also, it's a dramatic thriller and not a fantasy, so there's no ""real magic"" in the film. If you get bored with it partway through, I would strongly encourage that you watch it to the end because the ending is really worth seeing. Overall Rating: 8.65/10."
" Good movie..but I don't think angier really dies like most people think .
",,"Angier might not be dead.I know its an abrupt beginning to an opinion but there it is.after returning from the jail meeting with bordon angier meets cutter.here when or before the jail sequence something happened that is not shown in the movie properly because it is supposed to be like an easter egg.angier discovers bordons secret somehow.he then realises that though he was able to kill one of them(fallon,he gets hanged) he is not completely safe.in my opinion angier used the machine one last time.after cutter left he had just enough time before bordon arrived,only this time he ENDS UP BEING ""THE MAN IN THE BOX"". As the movie ends and the narration says YOU ARE NOT REALLY LOOKING its clearly shown that there is another angier in a water filled box except he is not one of those who have drowned before because you can clearly see bubbles going up inside the box as the movie ends.There was a lot of hype surrounding this movie.I actually found it very clever and boring im afraid at times.it does have a great story, amazing cast. But its the screenplay which is both commendable and ""yawn""able at times. The story always shows this fallon following bordon and the wanted avoidance to show who this character ist so fooling for me. i was able to figure it out halfway through the movie.so it was falling back a bit for me.the stitching of the scenes in the first half was a bit patch but it becomes really enchanting as the story progresses. All being said it was a good time killer for me."
" So glad this movie did not stay an illusion...
",spoiler,"in the filmmakers' minds. Instead, it became one of the finest films of the year 2006. ""The Prestige"" is a perfect example of what a movie should be like if it does not rely on you liking and cheering for the central characters. Neither Angier (Jackman), nor Borden (Bale) are likable characters at all. And yet you are completely under their spell as this film goes on. This may be a bit of a subjective take as I quite like Hugh Jackman and find Bale a joy to watch most of the time as well. And Johansson and Hall are among my favorite actresses as well. But it's not only the cast that makes it so much worth watching. It's also the visual side. Art direction, set decoration, cinematography and costumes are top-notch and even the rare special effects are pretty nice. The film managed two Academy Award nominations for its visual side, both of them very deserved and I actually would not have minded if it had won one of these over ""Pan's Labyrinth"". The film's director is Christopher Nolan and he also wrote the movie together with his brother after the first Batman film. He also cast some of the actors from his superhero trilogy, including Bale and Caine, the only one who didn't do that much for me. Now back to Nolan's script: I think this is probably the heart and should of the film. Such love to detail, so much suspense, so many surprises and all these great scenes like the doppelgänger parts or the suicide of Hall's character in the room with all the birds, which were actually the way how he met her when he talked to her nephew. Very very smart screenplay. All in all, the best thing about it, however, is how he wrote the two protagonists and their egos constantly clashing against each other, maybe because they weren't so different after all. Of course, Jackman and Bale play a great role here too why it worked so well, but still you cannot appreciate Nolan's effort enough. And his brother's. Lets not forget him. People say, Nolan has problems when it comes to directing and writing realistic female character, but I disagree. He managed in this film without a doubt and he also managed in others. When the two magicians fight each other or I should probably say get their hands dirty, literally everybody else in this film is constantly affected: their women, their assistants, their set creators...The accidental death of one character's wife sets off a deadly spiral which results in murder in the end. Or does it really? Nothing in this film is what it seems and we do not only get one major plot twist in the end, but two. Apart from that, the progress in terms of inventions and electricity also brings a completely new dimension of progress for the profession of a magician, actually for life in general, for everybody. So, we also get some interesting references on Nikola Tesla and Thomas Edison. I also liked how Nolan revealed some tricks, but not all of them, so the movie itself stays a bit of a mystery still. This was the second time I watched this film and it was as good as the first. I highly recommend watching the almost 10-year-old, 120 minute-long ""The Prestige"" It's possibly my favorite Christopher Nolan movie."
" Christopher Nolan does a good job!
",,"THE PRESTIGE is one of Christopher Nolan's most underrated films. When people think of his movies, they always think of movies such as Memento, Inception and The Dark Knight Rises (both Inception and The Dark Knight Rises has been reviewed on IMDb).I might not like the story of the film, but I love the direction of Christopher Nolan and this movie is awesometacular in every way. First off, the acting is great. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johannson, David Bowie and Michael Caine all did really great jobs in this film and I could have not been more pleased.The music, cinematography and visual style are also gorgeous and the direction is perfect. The movie is also the prime example of keeping you in your seat in theaters or watching this on DVD or TV, it is a true blessing.Overall, I don't like the story of this movie, but I can still watch THE PRESTIGE and this movie is close to being a smash hit. So, I will give this film an 8 out of 10."
" Subject
",,"I had no any about this film.It was one of the film in my archive in hard disc.Prestige is a name caused on me suppose the film in drama or etc. categories.Being sci-fi lover ,I was not wondered at first. In the point of own subject,deserved better than 7 rating man. Bcse of wondering whats gonna happen during the film,its not boring. I specially enjoy watching films which unknowable until it goes end. Using Tesla and some theories made film' atmosphere interesting and you feel yourself living in those times. As result of my own experience this film,I recommend it to every sci-fi lovers.Great Job Man!"
" Dark magical thriller
",,"This movie enthralled me in every shot. The actors showcased finesse in terms of acting and Chris Nolan achieves a tour de force in every shot. For a lover of period dramas, I found the movie incredibly well-directed and the suspense trickled drop by drop as the scenes progress. I have not read the book but apparently the author wanted Nolan to adapt his story. I would say he had an excellent hunch. Rebecca Hall especially made a mark. The last time I saw her in Parade's End (the BBC TV mini series), she took my breath away. Hugh Jackman lives under the skin of his character. Christian Bale succeeded in pulling the wool over the audience's eyes too. All in all, a classy movie."
" Great story of magic, rivalry and tricks
",spoiler,"The story literally blows away minds. It's nicely complex yet it spreads all the significant details right under our nose the whole time. Just as the Angier refuses to admit that Borden's trick is just a simple one, the movie nicely steers the audience into waiting to make a conclusion about the final deal about the secret of the prestige. The additional thing put by the magic tricks, the romance angles, Tesla and Edison, and the subplot with Borden's child is just great. But looking back to this movie, it feels strange that the movie reveals all the hidden secrets and resolves all questions at the end, which are not the typical of a Christopher Nolan movie. The acting overall is great. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale nicely put on the rivalry between their characters. Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall nicely complete the additional romances and intrigues angle. Michael Caine completes the movie with his mentor role."
" A Short Review ...
",spoiler,"The Prestige,is one of my favourite movie because of it's story line,it's suspense ,enthusiasm and passion of characters,awesome acting of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale ,other characters like Michael Caine,Scarlett Johnsson etc also did their role best. The best thing was the suspense that was totally unpredictable and the way by which story line was organized and had shown...I mostly liked the role of Hugh Jackman because of his craze to became a greater magician and to fool the audience ,the feel of his character was stunning and the dialogue which he spoke at last scene to Christian Bale before dying caught my heart,those were beyond the explanation,simply love that... The Best Dialogue of movie which inspired me was ""Obsession is a young man game""..."
" Dark, twisty, stylish and suspenseful
",,"This was better than I was expecting; dark, twisty, stylish and suspenseful. It's a fantastic period piece too and you really find yourself taken back to the Victorian era.The Prestige follows two stage magicians as they try to one-up and ultimately destroy each over the course of their careers. Always searching for that one next great magic trick and eventually revenge after Alfred (Christian Bale) is accidentally responsible for killing someone close to his brother (Hugh Jackman) Of course there are great performances from all involved and the audience is left trying to catch up and figure out the many twists involved. And while I got the how's of one of them ending up in jail I sure didn't figure out the big reveal at the end. Michael Caine plays their mentor, and there's a neat cameo from David Bowie. Worth watching. 12.13"
" Watch closely
",spoiler,"Definitely a film that can be seen more than once, Christopher Nolan's detailed and intense exploration of a rivalry between two magician's is intelligent, thoughtful and at a times thrilling drama piece set in the late 1800s; an exciting time of innovation and technological achievement. Making use of a non linear time line the director is able to explore several themes concerning human perception and obsession by tracking the triumphs and failures of two 19th century magician's which remains interesting right up to the last minute and does not lose it's energy and intrigue when exploring the mechanical and psychological techniques that the characters use to perform illusions. Complimented by an exciting 1878 setting, well executed Magician set pieces and strong performances from Christian bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine, this Drama cleverly allows the viewer to witness the secrets behind certain magic tricks that are performed on stage and the various techniques involved in deception so that the viewer becomes captured by the art and not fooled by it. What is interesting is the exploration of deception and trickery within characters as well as the apparatus's that the magician's use which makes this both a visually and philosophically fruitful movie experience. It's not clear whose side the audience is meant to take between Bale and Jackman's character, so the dramatic focus is all the more effective as the characters remain interesting and so avoid becoming archetypal good and bad characters Overall the films qualities are visual, meaningful, intriguing and suspenseful which compliments the actors and the director is this film of strong quality"
" Sleight of hand, comes in terms of writing by the screenplay of this.
",,"Sleight of hand, comes in terms of writing by the screenplay of this. The dexterous Christopher Nolan has mad a movie on Magic and he reveals how intricately and deceptively can a movie on Magic be made. With so many intercuts, mis-en-scenes, it's tough to grasp the pace and understand reason behind everything till the very end. The intrigue builds up with each passing scene but Alas, it falls flat in the end. The only thing I did not like is the last 2 minutes when so much revelation is done is so less time. For the rest of the time, its stupendously outstanding.The cast has done a prime job, especially Christian Bale. Hugh Jackman and the beautiful Scarlett Johansson have played their parts convincingly well. I cannot name the characters here, as Bale and Jackman play multiple characters in the film and it's tough for me to putting them and taking away the intrigue and mystery. Scarlett Johansson plays Olivia Wenscombe and adapts to it extremely well. The art direction is one that is extremely commendable and needs more than a thought, the setup entirely needed vision and the director Nolan had all that and more. The music is extremely situational and wonderful as it does not interrupt the narrative and still holds a place in the memory of the viewer. Mind you, this is not a film to watch for fun, it needs some brains to decipher this, to contemplate this and to get this into our head. So the prime most thing it demands is attention and some concentration, you give them to the film, it rewards you overwhelmingly and that's a great thing for a film. The cinematography is wonderful, some long shots at Tesla's place are really wonderful. The dark and intriguing atmosphere is well built up. Kudos to the cameraman Wally Pfister. It's a wonderful film and indeed one of the best film made on magicians. Having said that, it's a must that we have our brains intact while watching this. A 4/5 for this."
" ""...You don't really want to know. You want to be fooled.""
",,"Another classic by Christopher Nolan. Not only is this movie masterfully written, but the cast is great, and the performances are great. The movie is extremely clever and well directed. The Prestige will keep you guessing until the very end. The movie does run a bit long though, but, the movie is great that you can forgive it for its long run time.The movie tells the story of two magicians and how they slowly become rivals. A war ensues between these two magicians, and the movie transitions to being centered around a specific magic trick. This movie is great, and is close to being a Masterpiece."
" Loved this film.
",,"Great film! Great cast! Great Story! That is all. i remember watching this film and was well impressed, haven't seen it in a while will have to go back and watch it again! if you've not seen this your missing out!if you looking for a film which keeps you guessing and you enjoy it then you wont regret watching this. i had to read all about this film once i got back from the cinemas to discuss! even the magic tricks are just a treat to watch! Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are awesome as rivalries! and not forgetting Michael Caine who obviously doesn't disappoint!All in all perfect film don't think i can fault it!"
" Great Magician Duo
",spoiler,"The Prestige opens in London around the turn of the 19th century, with the death of magician Rupert Angier (Jackman), with Alfred Borden (Bale), another magician, as the only suspect. While Borden is held in prison during the trial, he is brought a copy of Angier's journal, which he reads and we see in flashbacks. One of these flashbacks reveals that years earlier, Angier got hold of a copy of one of Borden's journals and while Angier reads it we get a further flashback and so we have a flashback within a flashback, which allows us to see the story from both of the lead character's point of view.Both Angier and Borden began their career's as apprentices to the same magician. Angier's wife was the magician's assistant. One night, Angier's wife died during a water tank trick because she was unable to untie the knots in time; knots tied by Borden. This incident is the beginning of the rivalry and hatred between the two men that will carry throughout the movie.They both soon launch themselves into solo careers. Borden is the superior magician, but Angier, with the help of his mentor, Cutter (Caine), is a far better showman. Cutter hires Angier a pretty assistant (Johansson) and helps him learn a few new tricks. Borden on the other hand, while not as successful, performs tricks that Angier longs to master. After stealing Borden's greatest trick, The Transported Man, Angier becomes very successful, but still his greatest obsession is getting revenge on Borden by humiliation or any other means he can. His obsession lasts years and takes him around the world and costs him dearly, both emotionally and financially. Borden doesn't sit idly by either, matching Angier with acts of retaliation that prolong the rivalry. And the revenge on both sides isn't merely connected to their careers as both of them extract their pound of flesh from the other.Jackman and Bale make great rivals and while at times Jackman's Angier seems like the protagonist, they each rotate in and out of that role as the story reveals its secrets. In the end you might be wondering if the film contains a protagonist at all or if both characters haven't each received what was coming to them. Caine's and Johansson's roles are both supporting as their character's lives are dictated by Borden and Angier."
" New and Unique Movie
",,"Amazing movie ever seen on Magic, absolutely perfect making, though the plot based with the theme such as grudge, revenge, obsession etc, the way it is portrayed is totally awesome.This movie could be called as something like ""Batman Vs X-men"", yeah Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play a role of a typical magic professional rivals, who always search for the good time to pull each other down, the only strategy that both use to do so, is find something best than other, both strive a lot to come up with some much more innovative magic tricks than their respective opponents, both sabotaging the tricks of each other trying to gain the recognition along with to fulfill their grudge, both come up with teleportation trick and each other try to depict themselves as the real 'Transported Man', the more they get competitive the more the things begin to get nasty, the story gets curious when Angier come up with some new magical innovation with the help of Nikola Tesla, he finds the way to form his own multiple duplication which is required for his magic tricks and he steadily gains the popularity as 'The Great Danton', but once when Angier was performing his popular trick Borden get down to find out an actual secret behind his mysterious magic, but surprisingly Borden is accused of Angier's death and is subjected to the death sentence, at last in the climax how Borden escapes the death and how Angier pay for his brilliant cheat full illusion forms the rest of the story.The way the story has been presented is totally fine, screenplay plays the prominent part of this movie, performance by those superheroes are great, splendid direction by Christopher Nolan, the mention of the characters such as Thomas Edison & Nikola Tesla makes to seem like a satire of their respective true life conflicts, overall it's a unique try and a perfect making."
" Nolan's Masterpiece
",,"Up until very recently I had Inception as my favorite Christopher Nolan movie and quite frankly I thought that the remaining movies I had to watch weren't up to the task of dethroning it. With Following and Insomnia still in my list to watch, The Prestige is now the movie to beat. With a simple story about a rivalry between two magicians lies a complex script full of symbolism and that itself is presented as an illusion. Combined with Nolan's mastery in technical aspects and you've got yourself an enthralling movie that will leave you asking questions long after its finished (much like Inception did for me).Like I said this whole movie feels like an illusion and it's like the audience is being played. The question is will you want to be fooled? Or will you want to find out the secret. I won't go into plot details as I feel you should watch this with as little info about it as possible. About what I found was great in the movie, of course the technique put in by the crew complimented the movie very well. In a movie like this, though, the performances are the key to connecting with the audience and both Jackman and Bale show why they are the top talent today. Scarlett Johansson,Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine and even David Bowie contribute well to the movie and only add to its greatness. Some people might condemn it for being over explanatory, but personally I don't believe this to be a problem as I still questioned a lot of things after the movie was over. See it for yourself and find out if you were fooled. For me it was definitely worth it.Rating 9,5/10"
" impracticable magic
",,"I watched The Prestige in class. The first time I watched it, it was really hard to understand, because the action jumped from the past then to the present too many times, so that made me confused. However, that jumping from past to present turned out to be a big adventure in this movie. The changes in time happened because the story frequently followed the events written about in a diary which was written by a magician. One of the main characters was a man named Borden, who had his hand injured during a dangerous magic act. He had a twin brother, but the two of them pretended to be only one person. Because of this, the second twin had to cut off two of his fingers in order to look exactly like his brother. Also, one of the twins always had to pretend to be someone else. They did this to fool people in their magic act. I asked myself lots of questions while watching The Prestige. If I were in the movie, I do not know if I could give up my fingers to be popular. A Chinese magician in the movie also lived a lie for by pretending to be old and weak just to make his magic work. He did impracticable magic that people were amazed by. I could never do that. I think this movie does not focus only on magic tricks. It shows us how humans are unreliable, greedy, delouse and full of tragic madness, all to create amazing magic."
" Great movie
",spoiler,"This is a movie I would definitely recommend watching. If you're like me,constantly looking for some brain teasers,this is the movie for you. Throughout the whole picture,Robert(Hugh Jackman)focuses on how Alfred(Christian Bale) performs a certain magic trick with two doors and a ball. Many different characters appear,even some historical figures (such as Nikola Tesla) which indirectly contribute to the final answer. Even though this is the main question of the movie,it also shows us the individual lives of both of the main characters,as well as their disputes over the years,and how their rivalry came to be. It is designed in such a way that leads you to think the answer is very complicated,but that's where Michael Caine comes in,offering a hint to solving the mystery which is the 'teleportation' magic trick,by saying that it is,in fact,very simple. In the end,when Alfred finally revealed that he has a twin brother with whom he performed various illusions,I felt very dumb. How was I not able to see such a simple answer? They've got you thinking it's real magic,or perhaps duplication,but,as Caine said it is nothing but simple. What makes me love this movie so much is that it leads us in a very different direction,only to stun us with the finale. And that,my friends,is the greatest illusion of all!"
" One of My Favorites
",spoiler,"The Prestige is one of my favorite movies of all time. On a list of Pulp Fiction, Memento, Fight Club, and Donnie Darko, The Prestige is high up there on captivating movies with a twist ending. Christian Bale did a tremendous job in his role and so did Hugh Jackman. I'm not really big on directors but Christopher Nolan is one of the few who just does such a great job with his movies and the story telling within the story telling. It's really an all around, well rounded, movie. The only downside is it's rarely on TV and it's not on Netflix. If you can purchase the movie, do it, it's definitely worth keeping in your collection. As soon as I remember to buy it, I certainly will."
" Great movie with some flaws.
",,"First off, I want to say that when I was young, I used to visit circus a lot and a lot of events which showcased Magic Tricks, I was even enthralled and excited at such events being held at my school. I was also interested and learning Magic Tricks and showing them to my friends and parents. There is nothing to be ashamed about in this case, a lot of people watched Magic as kids. The basic premise of the Prestige is just perfect for my taste as it is about Magic Tricks and two Magicians.When I first heard about the Prestige, i thought it was some kind of a wizard movie with real magic, People having a reason for flying and transporting simple for no real reason other than it's REAL MAGIC. Luckily when I did more research I was glad that it was actually more realistic and based on Magic Tricks. This movie tells you about the life of Magicians back in the late 1800s, Magic meant everything to them they were obsessed with their tricks and they felt revealing their tricks would ruin them. Secrets were everything to them. The setting of the movie mind you in fantastic, the visuals, the areas, the clothes and even the *FUNNY* accents kind of suit the setting. A rivalry between two magicians which starts as a personal one turns more into a obsessive and professional one as one gets obsessed with the secret behind the other's trick and wants to prove he is the better magician.The plot is very good overall, but the movie can and will get confusing because the timeline is not depicted well, when you are watching the Long Past, the recent past or the present, things will get confusing and there is not text guiding you to understand which year you are in. This will cause the viewer to mix things up and he will lose attention. The story would have greatly benefited from a chronological order or at least a proper descriptions of the years. The plot also starts out extremely slow and drags out till the rivalry actually starts.Acting wise, the film is excellent, Hugh Jackman is awesome as Angier or the Great Danton, he is just natural in his acting, Christian Bale gives a great performance, many may find his character confusing and hard to understand at first but it will all come to ahead, his fake accent is not good though. Michael Caine is great and actually has a natural accent. The rest of the cast does a great job as well.I also feel like that an addition of such a Sci-Fi dimension kind of hurt the movie, not only it is not exactly believable if the time period is taken into consideration a more logical explanation would have worked better. The secrets of Bale and Angier serve as the twists of the movie. Angier's was disappointing whereas Bale's was something I saw coming a few minutes before it took place. After a second watch it is laughable how many clues were there, perhaps more analytic and deep thinkers would have seen it coming a mile away, and I won't be surprised if they actually did. The twists are not exactly a strong suit.The ending however had a good, clear and true message, we do not exactly always look for the secrets behind the tricks, because doing that ruins the trick and we won't want to see it anymore, that is exactly why the secrets are a magicians life. Few flaws aside prestige should see, any Nolan fan, Bale or Jackman, movie fans or even people who used to enjoy magic tricks at various shows should watch this great movie, few minor flaws aside, you are in for a great treat. Overall 8/10."
" Make sure you are watching closely!!
",,"Arguably the best movie directed by Nolan. Every time I watch it, feel like I have discovered a new secret in this movie. Sometimes I feel one can do doctorate on this movie. A movie made from a good book always makes sense. Though I have not read the book still I feel it is one of the best movies based on a book. Its a complete Psycho-mystery, as it progresses form two different psyches. This movie allows you to be the judge between the good and the evil, and yet it leaves many doubts in your mind.Dare you allow your mind to wander on something else while watching The Prestige,you will miss many things. This movie can be presented in hundred ways and the way it has been presented and edited, leaves you full of surprises and doubts.It will confuse you but will entertain you and will give you optimum utilization of your time.I am sure I have not given you any valid reason to watch this movie, but if you like watching movies, you must have already watched it or you don't really like watching movies."
" Another Nolan masterpiece
",,"Christopher Nolan has made many fantastic films. Not including the Dark Knight trilogy, he has created a reputation to keep you guessing until the very end of the movie, and often after you have left the theater. ""The Prestige"" follows the vein of Nolan's earlier works such as ""Shallow Grave"" and ""Memento"", in which the twists come fast and furious during the last third of the film. To summarize, Hugh Jackman (Robert Angier) and Christian Bale (Alfred Borden) play magicians who were once friends and now are out to ruin one another's career and life. Nolan creates narratives that intertwine from each magician's point of view, as both Bale and Jackman have each other's journals and are reading what they are believing to be each other's secrets. The time period is fantastic to see(late 1800's) with costumes and architecture breathing life into the film. Jackman plays an intense and determined role of Angier, while Bale often comes across as calculating and manipulative. The direction by Nolan was excellent in that he creates a story in which you genuinely like one character and loathe the other in the first half of the movie, and then your mind is changed the second half. That impressed me and kept me very interested to see the conclusion and how each character's obsession deteriorates their lives. It is a film you watch several times, as you get much more out of it after a second viewing, knowing the twists and seeing the subtle clues that Nolan cleverly waves in front of you. And of course, you don't know what hit you until the credits start rolling."
" Obsession and Revenge
",,"Around the turn of the century, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo), and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are assistants to the magician Cutter (Michael Caine). Due to hubris, Julia is killed in one of the tricks. It sets off a combative obsessive competition between Angier and Borden that ends in their eventual destruction. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson play other love interests.This is a dense complicated plot. If you figured it out before the ending, then you're much smarter than me. Christopher Nolan and his brother have woven an intrigue story of obsession and revenge. The twists will leave you stunned. The reveals of the tricks are jaw dropping. It doesn't get more mind bending than this one.In a way, the flashforwards are not that necessary. It throws a complicated story into more confusion. It's too much. The movie may be better to be more straight forward. Personally, I like the challenge."
" The Prestige: Are you watching closely?
",,"The Prestige is Christopher Nolan's adaptation of Christopher Priest's book by the same name. Some of the most memorable aspects of this film are the interactions and dialog between its characters. There's a scene where Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) tells his wife Sarah Borden (Rebecca Hall) that he loves her. She asks him to repeat it and he does, ""Not today"" she says. Confused, Alfred asks her what she means. Sarah: ""Well some days it's not true. Maybe today you're more in love with magic. I like being able to tell the difference, it makes the days it is true mean something."" Nolan is trying to show how Alfred's obsession with his hobbies is interfering with all other aspects of his life. But there's more beneath the surface. These interactions allow us to understand the movie's characters on a deeper level, a peek behind the curtain of their lives if you will. The actors picked to play these characters were nothing short of excellent; Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, David Bowie... Hugh Jackman brings an unanticipated passion to his character Robert Angier. I'll admit when I thought ""magicians"" Jackman was not the first name to pop into my head. However I was pleasantly surprised with his spectacular performance. He really shows his versatility as an actor when you see him play his drunken barfly and prospective double, Root. Speaking of versatility Christian Bale has always been an intense method actor. It really shines through in his cold and devious take on Alfred Borden, so much so his character is even fearful and menacing at times. Bale truly makes you believe his character is willing to go to great lengths to become the world's greatest magician. Under the direction of Christopher Nolan, The Prestige is clever, daring, and ultimately surprising. He continues to prove himself as an established director in the industry with his brilliant take on the source material. He's created a unique film with a wide vision for this time period. With an all-star cast and a keen eye for detail, Nolan provokes audiences to see past the surface to the deeper meaning behind the illusions. Symbolism is a huge facet of multiple scenes which begs the question, ""Are you watching closely?"" I particularly enjoyed the element of suspense he was able to inject into this type of film. After all, what good magic trick doesn't keep you guessing? The fact that I couldn't immediately tell the fate of most of the characters involved was extremely refreshing. That element of suspense created another feeling of fear for the wellbeing of each character. I often found myself wondering, ""Who would best the other and how would it happen? Are these men willing to kill one another just to prove a point?"" The Prestige is dramatic story of rivalry, betrayal, and sacrifice. This is a world where people want to believe in magic, they want to be fooled to think that there is something greater outside their average and ordinary lives. The magicians know the secret and the audience might think they know, but as Borden says, ""The secret impresses no one. The trick you use it for is everything."" The quest to hold that bewilderment over the audience is a central theme these magicians seek to control. The road to this type of power is wrought with greed, bitter loneliness, and even death. Another theme here was that of a broken heart. Tragic though it may be, some hearts just never mend. How far would you go to peruse your passion? How far is too far? This movie is about becoming so consumed in a lust for vengeance and fame that nothing else matters. At our very core we are human and humans make mistakes. I'd like to quote Alexander Pope by saying, ""To err is human; to forgive, divine."" If The Prestige is meant to teach us anything it's that we often lose sight of what's most important in life, that we can even lose sight of ourselves. The secret here is nothing is more important than the lives of your family and loved ones. We should also be content with what we have; obsession poisons the hearts of men. Nothing is worth destroying the existence of others to benefit ourselves. In this case, the end will never justify the means. So again I ask you, how far are you willing to go? Would you take a life? Would you save one? This is a film that will surely resonate with its audience for some time, as it has with me."
" The Secret Impresses No One. The Trick You Use It For Is Everything.
",,"An ingeniously crafted tale of twists & turns, a fascinating vignette of obsession & jealousy, and an interesting illustration of friendship & rivalry, The Prestige is a magical piece of thrilling cinema by Christopher Nolan which comes with its own set of pledge, turn & prestige moments just like any great magic trick and cleverly manages to take its ordinary premise & turn it into something truly extraordinary.The Prestige is the story of a friendship that became a rivalry which later turned deadly. The plot concerns two renowned stage magicians in London near the end of the 19th century who engage in competitive one-upmanship in an attempt to create the ultimate illusion but their increasing obsession to best each other's tricks eventually leads them on a path which culminates with devastating consequences.Directed by Christopher Nolan, the film presents the master director in sublime form & is quite possibly the most creative work of his film career. He might have upgraded to making only big- budget blockbusters ever since but this is where Nolan's talents as a filmmaker are at its most bare. Each element is carefully processed & cleverly integrated into the picture and the final pay- off is as satisfying as it is spellbinding.The screenplay marks the first collaboration between Nolan brothers & is deftly adapted from the novel of the same name. Art direction wonderfully brings late 19th century London & Colorado to life, Cinematography captures every moment in clear, crisp detail while also making extensive use of hand-held shooting & cold colour temperatures, Editing is the film's finest aspect without a doubt while composer David Julyan chips in with a fitting score.Coming to the performances, The Prestige features a star-studded cast in Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall & Michael Caine, and they're all pretty convincing in their given roles with Jackman & Bale impressing the most as two rival magicians. Even Caine's character plays a significant part here unlike his supporting roles in other Nolan films. And Johansson does a good enough job playing both pawn & player in the featured rivalry.On looking back, what's even more astonishing is that everything we want to know is right in front of us. From its opening moments, the film keeps dropping obvious hints about its mystery yet successfully manages to create an illusion of hiding a big secret. And just like those people amongst the audience waiting to be amazed by an upcoming magic trick, we fail to see it because we're not really looking. Because just like them, we want to be fooled.On an overall scale, The Prestige is one of the finest achievements in the directional career of Christopher Nolan that intertwines its three acts of storytelling with three acts of illusion in a highly rewarding manner to deliver a cinematic experience that's magical in every sense of the word. An immensely compelling take on obsession, rivalry, secrecy, sacrifice & duality, The Prestige is that great magic trick which viewers won't soon, if ever, be able to recover from. One hundred percent recommended."
" One of the best films that I've seen in awhile...
",,"This is my favorite film of all time right behind Schindler's List. This is my favorite film of Christopher Nolan, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman (besides Les Mis). The acting is Perfection. And the concept is mind blowing. I had to watch the ending several times to fully understand it. But I like movies that make me think. If you don't like movies like that or you don't like mind twisting films then you may not like this film. But this movie is perfection. If I could give it a 9.8 I would. I recommend this movie for anyone who enjoys films like me. If you love a plot twisting, perfect film.. This one is for you. So I hope that my review helped you and that you take this movie into consideration because personally I thin it's worth it."
" Another Nolan Masterpiece!
",,"The movie is a gem. 'What else do you expect to happen when Batman and Wolverine fight each other with magic tricks?' The quote is wholeheartedly true. A film of magicians, who add more magic to the film. The concept of the movie is distinguished and it is exhibited to the viewers in the finest possible fashion. The movie has got one of the most devastating story lines; it's rich with first-rate quotes, skillful acting and a flabbergasting climax.The effulgent star cast urges you to watch the film. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman both have grabbed their chances of working in a Nolan film with both the hands. Both playing magicians have done a magnificent job.Christopher Nolan's direction was peerless, this goes without saying. He is undoubtedly the best, second to none. And he proves it every time he decides to direct a movie.Spend 2 hours of your life watching this movie and it will be very, very rare if you don't get impressed."
" Startling Magician Story.
",,"Christopher Nolan directs this imaginative, original, and quite unpredictable story of two rival magicians(played effectively by Christian Bale & Hugh Jackman) who escalate their rivalry when Jackman's wife dies, and blames Bale for it. This leads to increasingly daring magic tricks, each trying to sabotage the other, until a double-twist ending that no one saw coming...Film also fictionalizes a meeting with real inventor Tesla, who had experimented with new power sources and electricity, but was largely forgotten by history. In this story, he invents a machine that both magicians covet, but which doesn't work according to plan.Densely plotted but mesmerizing and superbly crafted story ends on a most surprising yet satisfying note. Just like a real magic trick, its all about deception and misdirection, so pay attention!"
" Must See !
",,"Great twist after twist after twist! Maybe the final twist had something to be desired and could have taken the movie all the way to the upper echelons but like I say, MUST SEE ! The actors are all fantastic and maybe Bales' best role ever. No matter where Micheal Caine plays, it is always an added success to the movie. One sees that evidently from the movie Inception (also by Nolan). Script fantastic with all the twists and like I said above (not mentioning details so that no spoilers involved) the final twist could have had the element to take the movie rating to 10 and reach the upper echelons. The director has taken the movies to new levels giving the era of the screen play but could be very contemporary."
" Really Wanna Watch This.
",,Hey. I haven't seen this movie yet but I can't wait to see it. I really wanna see it. My friends have seen it and they really like it. I can't wait to like this movie. I really want to see The Prestige. Is there anyone on this site who wants to give me a summary or something. I am a very busy dude and so I don't know when I'll get to watch this movie. I really want to see it though. Can someone loan me this movie. Where can I find this. Do they sell this at Walmart. I have a gift card to Walmart that's why I'm asking. I really want to see this. I almost watched it last night but I didn't. It's okay though because I was just talking with Riley I don't know if anyone on this site knows her. She's a great gal. Riley has seen The Prestige. I want to watch it because Riley has watched it and so has her family. Chayse has seen it too and I bet Ana has seen it as well. I wanna see this flick.
" My favorite movie for a reason
",,"People tend to react really hyped when it comes to movies they really enjoyed. We leave the movie theater and compare stuff we liked, which impressed us and stuff which we didn't. 7 years have passed since I watched ""The Prestige"" for the first time and although I must have watched the movie for several times now, I never feel totally ""in control"" over my emotions. The central question about ethical behavior around which this movie has been built never seems to be as clear or as easy to answer as the ones all the other movies I have watched have presented to me. The Prestige is build like a ""magic trick"" which consists of three acts itself (genius: The official Trailer tells you more than you could have known). The plot is told from different times and from different angles so that you never really know what is going on till the end. This doesn't necessarily mean that this is good way to tell a story, but Christopher Nolan has perfected this way of telling a plot since Memento. There will be times when you will think that you know exactly what is going on or you know what this movie is about but believe me: You don't. I don't want to spoil anything but if you like any sort of medium that really challenges your mind, you need to do yourself the favor and watch this movie. ""ABRACADABRA!"""
" Too much in some ways
",spoiler,"I really enjoyed this movie because of the craftsmanship and intriguing story/characters. The performances and scenery are top notch. The directing and story telling were intricately and skillfully made. The story is rather tragic, so don't watch this one to be uplifted. The shortcomings of this movie are: 1) It is too intricate. The scenes are out of sequence jumping around from recent past to years past to present without any blatant cues as to the time period. It took me about ten minutes or so to get a feeling for the jumps. Once I got a feel for how they were indicating the time, I was able to lose myself in the movie, however, the others who were watching it with me had a hard time. If you are someone who has trouble with flashback, you probably will not enjoy this movie for this reason alone. Although, I think that they did a very good job in this aspect, it will probably alienate many viewers through confusion. 2) This is not really a scifi story, yet it has scifi which I think detracts from the story. They could have easily written it without any scifi at all and I think that it would have been a more satisfying and interesting story. Throwing in a little bit of scifi unexpectedly and using it as a significant plot device at the very end of the story ruined my suspension of disbelief. There are so many puzzle pieces to assemble regarding the characters' actions, motivations, and secrets that throwing this curve ball in at the end detracts from the effect that they had worked so hard to achieve. This movie is about characters and intrigue rather than fanciful technologies."
" A tale of misdirection, bitter rivalry and incapability to deal with loss
",,"What I've always admired about Christopher Nolan is his ability to make even the most extraordinary tales and people seem believable. Here we have a story about two stage magicians, set in the late 19th century - or possibly the early 20th - where they try to outdo each other with outlandish magic tricks and performances. Throw in some scifi elements, or at least storytelling aspects, near the end and you have a tale that's very out there. But it's told very close to earth, with identifiable characters, none of which is the outright villain or even the protagonist. The story is mainly told from Angier's (Hugh Jackman) perspective, but there are bits here and there that show us the viewpoint of Borden (Christian Bale), which keeps the story grounded and allow us to see that that neither of these men are completely right in their quest for revenge and recognition. One can of course argue in either direction, but the matter of the fact is that both of them were given the chance to stop, but they didn't take it, which allows the story to exist, yes, but which also makes it a bitter one.So that's one aspect that absolutely works. There are many more, such as the characters themselves, or perhaps I should say the main duo, Angier and Borden. The rest of the cast isn't bad - with Michael Caine being the everlasting beacon of solid performing - but Jackman and Bale are the main attraction of this film. They work off each other beautifully and they truly took these characters and ran with them.Add in some real twists and genuine surprises and you have one of those timeless stories in your hands. This is a story that could be told over and over again in many forms, and it'd still work. It has great themes, clearly defined acts and above all else it's captivating. Still, given the magician aspect, I believe that it works in the given time period perfectly and the late 19th century is showcased beautifully.So what doesn't work, you might ask? Well, most of it does work, but as I stated, there are some slight leanings towards science fiction near the end, which I thought were unneeded or at least distracting. They do allow for the story to reach its logical conclusion and give us some really disturbing scenes, but it's still weird to see such stuff in a film where there were none before. A deliberate choice in this case, true, but it doesn't come off as well as it should. Still, more of a matter of taste than a real flaw.All in all I really like this film. It's solid from start to finish, with great characters and even greater story. One of Nolan's better ones and that's saying something."
" Pretty entertaining and worth a watch.
",spoiler,"This film is a revenge film and deals with two professional magicians that share a tarnished history.I enjoyed watching the story unfold, and while it was predictable at times, I thought the cast made up for some of the weaker plot issues.The only major issue I had was the strange time line used by the film. The film frequently transitions from present time, to the past, and to different locations, and the transitions are not the smoothest. At times, I found that it was a bit challenging to recognize these transitions, and while you will figure it out eventually, this confusion took away from the film as a whole.Definitely worthy of a watch, and while it's not one of the greatest films you'll see, it certainly won't be the worst either.7 of 10 stars for: Good actors, good production values, and a decent story."
" The Great Trick
",spoiler,"I thought this movie was great. Although originally, I thought the story sounded dull, the writer was able to make this movie flow well and maintain my interest.The twist of the duplicating machine and the twin brother took me completely by surprise, though I know I should have seen it coming. The suspense and depth to the movie helped keep me intrigued and thinking about it after the movie.The one issue I had with the movie was the teleportation/duplication device. Up until then, the movie, seemed pretty realistic. Despite this, I feel the magic device helped really spice things up and I don't think it would have been the same without it. Perhaps it was a double-edged sword.Overall his descent into anger and jealousy and loss of his woman helped make the movie much more intense."
" Prepare to be amazed
",spoiler,"Christopher Nolan certainly knows how to make thrilling dramas with loads of interwoven plot points amalgamating into an inextricable storyline. In a way, the movie was one act of magic itself comprising of a pledge, a turn and the prestige of its own. The final voice over of the movie indeed leaves the viewer smiling because he does not want to give too much thought to the intricacies of the plot and wants to be fooled. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were both great in their portrayal of a spiteful relationship between two magicians,comprising of continuing acts of one-upmanship and revenge. Michael Caine does what he does best. He acts as the viewer's guide to the movie, moving the plot along and presenting the lesser known facts that lie below the surface. Scarlett Johansson looks oh so desirable in the movie showcasing her grace and her voluptuous figure as an assistant to the magicians who unknowingly gets involved in an unpleasant tussle between the two. The inclusion of the AC vs DC argument between Tesla and Edison is something that the science lovers would relish. Both Andy Serkis and David Bowie act as rather mysterious caretakers of the science side of the movie and indulge into it only as per requirement of the plot. In summary, when people go out for a movie, they wish to be enthralled, to be shocked and to be entertained during those two hours and The Prestige (in general, all of Nolan's works) serves them all of this and more."
" What the heck
",,"The Prestige, directed by Christopher Nolan, is one of the best and clever movies I've seen in a long time. The film stars Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale as two rival magicians who will do whatever it takes to show each other up. Both of these two actors play their characters very well.Why did I like the Prestige so much? Well, it is like Inception, in a way one of my all time favourite movies, also directed by Christopher Nolan. It is very clever and unpredictable, with lots of twists you'll never see coming. It's genius. The sets are all very believable, all the magic tricks are cool, and it is acted very well. Particular props go to Hugh Jackman.The Prestige is great. It's one of those movies you'll be thinking about for a while after you see it. The ending is so confusing, hence the caption of this review. It has a great story and it translates beautifully onto screen. And I think, as a viewer, that's what matters the most."
" Censorship of Home Video?
",,"I rented a copy of the Prestige and when the scene came up with Alfred Borden's complex illusion, the full take was cut. Alfred Borden bounced the rubber ball, went in one door, and then the take was cut before he came out of the other door and cached the ball. I really remember being blown away the first time I saw this scene in the movie and I am 100% sure the full scene was edited out of this rented copy. Why would they edit this scene out of the movie? It was breath taking, but would it really be considered a disturbing image? I really think there is a special place in hell for censorship. If this artful scene was simply to provocative for some small minded Christian, then people need to be aware they are not getting the full advertised value of their purchase. I really feel bait and switched, ripped off, and offended by this beautiful movie being edited for reasons I find difficult to fathom. This movie ""titled"" THE PRESTIGE, 2006 was rented from Family Video, and was distributed by Buena Vista Home Entertainment Inc. Burbank California If I find that this movie was edited at the request of Family Video I will cancel my membership with that establishment. If this censorship is the work of Buena Vista Home Entertainment I would demand that Family Video no longer stock titles from this distributor. If the efforts of Buena Vista Home Distribution are to censor films then I consider this company to be criminally destroying cultural history and your actions are akin to an Orwellian ""ministry of truth"". I personally feel like part of my history has been taken away from me. I have heard rumors of censorship in the home movie industry but until now I was not aware of it affecting the art I love."
" Brainmelting
",,"We learn within the first minute just what ""the prestige"" is. It would turn out to be what the film is really all about, its third act. The prestige of The Prestige is twist after twist after reveal until an ULTIMATE climax, but after the second big twist your brain will be mush. The film closes with a line about ""being fooled"" and I was certainly fooled. There are many questions that are answered, and further more questions that can have answers- but pursuing them would be pointless. The writing is incredible as far as the plot is concerned: the 'first, next, then' is well managed, but the ""why"" at the end has lots of ambiguity. Some won't like the lack of denouement, but it's almost certainly an artistic choice and thus subjective.The plot is not linear- if you read the back of the Blu Ray or IMDb description, you will be bewildered by the first 20 minutes. Keep an open mind and just absorb the scenes in the film- there is great reward.Artistically amazing, the turn of the 20th century is a unique time period hardly explored by genres of than the historical drama or biopic, both typically ""boring"" if well made films. The costumes, lighting and atmosphere are moody, like the film content. And it's really weird to hear Christian Bale's regular voice.There are issues however: the opening scenes are jarring, and it's always tough to tell when and how much time has jumped between scenes. Considering the high level of Nolan's films, especially their beginnings, this confusion put a damper on the whole film. Also, the initial friendship between Angier and Borden is hardly shown, and poorly sold. The themes of obsession and rivalry dominate the film: what would you do to get ahead of your opponent? Would it have a permanent effect on you? Both magicians cut moral corners, leading to another interesting idea: who's the good guy? Bad guy? Even by the end it can be tough to decide, if you choose to decide.The Prestige is an excellent film that boggles the mind, but I feel it too loose to be considered a Nolan masterpiece. Its plot, characters and acting are incredible, conveying a very topical feeling of magic. Nevertheless a worthy view, if you can tolerate small cracks throughout and chips off at the end. 8.5/10"
" Magic Tricks no problem
",,"To watch a film you must have three elements with you 1. Always pay attention to what's happening on screen 2.Pay attention to the plot elements 3.Make sure you take these elements with you when watching the prestige. Yes its not hard to tell that the Prestige is probably one of the most complicated movies out there and keeps you asking what's happening,sure its hard to understand but its a very exciting movie and even though I had to go to the toilet for the last half hour of the film I just couldn't miss a single minute.We all love Christopher Nolan but if your one of those who have a short attention span this film is not for you. But for the rest of you this is just Nolan at his finest and who is the better magician? Though you may be left wondering at the end even if you've payed the closest amount of attention it still would be a classic(and that's what you call a great film)Don't expect this film to be understandable because its not and you'll probably enjoy it no matter the age limit for kids would enjoy the magic tricks and us older men would enjoy it for the questions it asks and keeping us on the very edge of our seat for 2 hours(now thats what you call talent)The film is a bit slow (films 2 hours 10 mins long)for some parts and the questions are very hard to solve so it becomes an 8 1/2 out of 10"
" Challenges The Audience
",,"The Director's trademark complexity and fanciful film gyrations are sometimes a bit too complicated, and in an era of many movies with shallow, silly, stories it's hard to argue that something is too cerebral. Intelligent, thought provoking, layered messaging is not really in vogue.But this too can be a deterrent when things get out of hand when the sleight of hand and misdirection is overdone to the point of viewer fatigue. The magical momentum that is at the heart of this film can be lost among the intrigue somewhat, and can leave the audience with a bit of an overwhelming experience. This, depending on your movie watching IQ, can be exhilarating or exhausting.After all, it is a very good film with style and deep twists and turns and is another in a string of surprises from one of today's best Directors."
" Do you want to see a magic trick?
",spoiler,"Christopher Nolan's 'The Prestige' is first off visually as it looks stunning with its beautifully assured direction, excellent sets, & stunning effect. It's brings out to the world of the magicians of the turn of the century. The story itself of two warring magicians does have its charms, as both Christian Bale and Hugh Jackson were great in their respectable roles, playing the two rivaling magicians searching for that one jaw dropping trick to out shine the other. The two begin as friends, but when tragedy happens when a trick gone wrong, setting up for their lifelong battle to out shine the other begins. The charm and the magic of the film is painted gray as director Christopher Nolan (Batman Begins) brings a very dark and suspenseful look to Victorian London. The two leading stars followed up with Michael Caine, whom good in his role as a mentor type trying to inference and make peace between the two warring factions, but yet making it worst. Scarlett Johansson character is inter-twisted with both leads, but the acting from her wasn't much. David Bowie is nearly forgotten in his role as Nikola Tesla but yet his character is one that puts 'The Prestige' from Victorian historic melodrama to more Verne Steam punk Sci-fiction. He doesn't come into the film, until ¾ in. His role isn't large enough, nor long enough on film, but his character and his invention serves as the final twist in the story. The film is filmed & edited in a way throughout that feels as if it is concealing its hand in just for the final reveal. Unfortunately the reveal isn't as satisfying as it could have been, with half of it being a slyly admirable in its innocence & the other half simply jarring with the films tone & genre. It wasn't much to add it, as it was clearly out there before the final reveal. Is it worthy of the high marks? Not really--- it's works as suspense, thriller, but is it watchable after once--- sadly not. The film barely shows any other mood—then dark emotion that to the point, can serve to be somewhat depressing to watch. It's clearly not the film to watch at a party, or a get together. For a movie, it's really demand it's viewers to pay attention to every fact. It's hard to explain based on only viewing. The film is great, but it's semi overrated due to the popularity of Nolan. Watching the movie would do no favor if not watching it on BLU-RAY. It's one of the cleanest & sharpest BLU-RAY releases ever. It's a unique picture in this day & age for sure, & holds more showmanship & gloom than its counterpart 'The Illusionist', but the latter is a more satisfyingly (if only because it plays it safer) rounded film."
" The conclusion is comically implausible, but the preceding two hours are thoroughly engaging.
",,"Ultimately, like so many of Christopher Nolan's films, 'The Prestige' is ridiculous and far-fetched. The story twists in a way that beggars belief, in a way that's so desperately lacking in plausibility that one asks themselves 'Did I hear that correctly? Has it really just gone in that direction?' Thankfully, this occurs at the end of the film, the preceding two hours produce, generally speaking, a delightfully realistic, taut and human period drama that engrosses far more than I expected. The film follows two magicians Roger Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) whose rivalry becomes so bitter and intense that it escalates to deception and violence. Their desperate attempts to exceed each other are genuinely engrossing, especially when Borden first develops 'The Transported Man'. Angier and Borden's romantic partners, Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) and Sarah Borden (Rebecca Hall) respectively, are dragged into the acerbic rivalry, resulting in betrayal, adultery and depression. Indeed, the aforementioned twist is a vital device that makes the film, in the writers' minds at least, 'work', which means the film is rather flawed. The climax undermines everything that made the film good, but those two hours soften the blow considerably. All performances are solid, particularly Rebecca Hall's, who has a real, sweet naturalness about her that struck me as soon as she graced the screen. Christian Bale's accent takes at least 40 minutes to get accustomed to, it has an odd, contrived strain to it that normally only appears in interviews. As everyone knows, he's British, but I think his true accent was lost in Hollywood a long time ago, I'm no longer sure what his real accent is, and I don't think he does either."
" Christopher Nolan yet again shows us a Masterpiece with ""The Prestige""
",,"Christopher Nolan with ""The Prestige"", yet again shows his sheer brilliance and graces us with a Masterpiece. The Prestige revolves around the rivalry of two magicians; Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) who's friendship turns into a bitter rivalry after Robert's wife is killed in a magic trick gone wrong and he accuses Alfred of the dirty deed. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale's acting in this movie is impeccable. From the opening scene you get the feeling that both actors are literally as one with the character they are playing and this is what a top class actor must be able to do. The plot of the ""The Prestige"" is intricate and genius; full of twists and turns that keep you in suspense and keep you pondering on what will happen next. I literally sat on the edge of my seat the whole movie. It is a well thought out and original plot that Christopher Nolan executes with mastery. Robert Angier's and Alfred Borden's whole past is shown and the whole story revolves around their rivalry in a manner deserving to be truly called a masterpiece. The rivalry between these two is depicted in a strong and vivid way and you feel as if you yourself are in the movie standing right next to the two characters. Nolan uses the idea of each of the obsessed characters reading each other's diary and this brings out a series of flashbacks mixed with the present happenings and this is what makes up the excellent chemistry of the movie. The whole movie is a thrill to watch and the ending is profound and fitting for the whole plot; it is unexpected and one can only but give a standing ovation. I cannot begin to explain how much this movie amazed me. Nolan set out to keep the audience thinking the whole movie and he succeeded by a landslide. It is truly a movie that one cannot ignore. A story of two men's obsession with revenge and being better than the other but who can pay the ultimate sacrifice? ""Sacrifice is the price of a good trick"" --- The Prestige."
" ""It is very rare to see... real magic.""
",spoiler,"Oh man, this one had me right up to the part with the transporter/duplicator machine. Until then it was a compelling and complex tale dealing in murder, mystery and intrigue with a clever backdrop of magicians attempting to outdo each other with the grandest illusion of all time. What I'm not going to do is go back and watch this three times in a row like I did with ""Memento"" because when all is said and done, I won't be any better off. In a way I felt cheated that an 1880's era film would bring in a fictional sci-fi element the way it did. It seems to me the story could have gotten around that contrivance to come up with a more realistic resolution that confined itself to existing science and techniques of illusion. Then, when Borden (Christian Bale) had his final showdown with Angier (Hugh Jackman), he could have caught the bullet to end the picture on a more promising note. I don't really mean to sound so harsh on the film because like I said, up to the Tesla part this story was going great guns. Maybe because the guy portraying Tesla looked so much like David Bowie, it kept me off stride for a while as well. Then it turned out to be Bowie when the credits rolled, and I was back to thinking about that business with the cats and the hats. Maybe the whole thing was an illusion."
" The Prestige: A critique on the concept of movie
",,"I conceive that the any movie as a matter of fact can become successful if its core is a concept. Its a movie pertaining to human behaviors who are interested in becoming successful by following an idealism. whenever two persons fighting to achieve a single idealism finds it hard to find the secrets of that idealism, or he wrongly interprets the idealism, then he reaches a stage of perverted mind set. Even in this movie Hugh Jackman though right in presenting himself as a magician, making illusions, he goes wrong by losing his ""prestige"" both in show as well as in understanding the idealism. In spite of Mr.Cutter's immense knowledge of the trick, Jackman does not believe his words. The human behavior is to keenly know what others are doing and do the same either steal or copy or pull their legs for the self raise. But when it satisfies the extent of challenging the nature, nature or the destiny makes sure that it will always exist by destroying the unnatural one. The story has a nice balance and surprise maintained till the climax designed by Director Mr.Nole. The story also depicts how two mental status under a single guidance(teacher) turning into two rivals because of business and PRESTIGE issues. Prestige when exceeds the desires and ambitions of winning the others at the cost of challenging the nature, though nature looses some of its very needy part, does not hesitate to destroy the artificial existence. All that we need to remember is :- Anything Great deserves Sacrifice."
" Genre also may be fantasy or sci-fic
",,in the beginning the movie seems to be a competition between two magicians.i thought it would be very interesting to see that what new tricks of magic they will discover to make them self better than other and how they will ruin each others trick after reavling the truth behind that tricks in front of audience.but i disappoint when an unreal trick came to movie.it totally changed the plot of movie.how they can do this to a good going movie.this trick was about to make a duplicate of anything in a machine.so we suddenly enter in a fantasy or sci-fic world from a real world and this reveals after mid of the movie.so this is also a fantasy and sci-fic genre movie.
" Near-enough to magical; Nolan's twisting, agonising tale of love and aloofness makes for good viewing.
",,"The Prestiege is about performers performing at the top of their game without necessarily being at the peak of their well-being. It's about an emotional drive; a lust to conquer the seemingly impossible, a lust to pound one's opponent into the ground by showing up their entertainments and furthering the superiority that yours has. There are points in the film in which sheer anger and pure, unadulterated drive born out of one's deep feelings see certain characters get to where they are in the entertainments business depicted within; successes born out the hatred for a competitor, and the need to trump him, rather than because their respective show naturally progresses to the performances they end up doing.Director Christopher Nolan's film explores the quite maddening extent to which men within a particular field go, not necessarily for financial gain but to see their competitors, with whom they share a painful back-story, go nuts in trying to work out the extent of the practise. His film is ultimately a peek into the depraved nature of such a pastime, an exploring of a lust for quest for supremacy in so much one person is able to do what no one else in the world is capable. Such a back and forth is played out in The Prestiege, it here having an air of freshness to it in so much it is played out not as a contemporary crime thriller or similarly toned piece making use of the familiar hypothesis, but as a period drama, in late nineteenth century London, and somewhat remarkably revolves around people engaged in the career field of magic.We begin in the present on a strand seeing Christian Bale's Alfred Borden in prison, a man seemingly guilty of a drowning which he is accused of perpetrating; during these early scenes, we get a small measure of how much the secrecy of these people's magic means to them when Borden holds back on certain nuggets of information - despite both his freedom and his daughter's well-being there at stake. Miles away, Borden's ex-partner, Hugh Jackman's Robert Angier, is desperate for a meeting with an elusive elderly gentlemen based in some isolated snowy American nether-regions; his presence rearing the attention of somebody operating there, whom he has before neither met nor seen, but who directs praise at Angier for his work within the field of magic and stage trickery. Running on what Nolan achieved in Memento, in terms of tearing up the time-lines and flitting from one moment in time to another, we dart back to the very beginning of where it all began to go wrong for Angier and Borden.In the past, the pair of them operated in a troupé led by the suave expert in his field, John Cutter (Caine); Angier's wife Julia (Perabo) and a master of ceremonies character in true-to-life magician Ricky Jay. Backstage, and prior to going out so as to perform what they've been performing for a good stretch of time beforehand, the characters appear to clash in regards to what direction the group ought to head from here on in; Borden desiring the moving onwards and upwards to better things but whose enthusiasm is unmatched. During one particular show, tragedy strikes when disaster befalls a specific trick involving Julia and a seemingly-impossible escape from a glass container full with water; Julia not getting out in time and drowning before Angier's very eyes, thus the murder of which Bale was accused during the opening thus rears its head. What unfolds is an extension of the diligent lengths Nolan went during 2002's Insomnia, a film about a police officer seen killing another police officer by the very man he is there to catch; a film spilling out into a power struggle between two men of whom moral lines are blurred and one appears as distasteful as the other in spite of the fact they are near-enough poles apart. This is another one of those films in which heterosexual romances unfold around the fact that the film is ultimately about men and men co-existing with one another, and that nothing can deter them from what life's true purpose seemingly offers up: the need to quench a drive for implementing defeat upon them.Nolan deals with each strand attentively and in a thorough manner; the film's story, cascading into a bitter rivalry built on resentment never quite made clear as to whether it's out of anger of a false-accusation; unadulterated revenge or just pure hatred and jealousy for another man, is difficult not to get caught up in. Amongst this, the multi-equilibrium approach expressed through Angier's apparent attempts to bury ghosts in his venturing to America acts as a fascinating post-scripture to predominant duelling. It is something that furthermore carries with it enough enticing drama, as this lead becomes more and more involved with apparent recluse madmen, to follow the film on through to a denouement dealing with questions posed throughout the project's main body. A quaint parallel lies with the fact Nolan knows he is making a film about people putting on a show; people wanting to do their best for a paying audience out to see those whom they recognise going through motions inherently and professionally. His film, itself full of tricks and twists causing us to take a step back and think about it, is just as good-a slice of showmanship as anything his characters can conjure up."
" ""Are you watching closely""
",,"The rivalry between two magicians is exacerbated when one of them performs the ultimate illusion.Yes, another Nolan film reviewed. This guy is a legend, but perhaps I should say with his more smarter films. Prestige, I admit, is not as good as people say it is. I do love the magic, and I do love the twists, but I think this and Following were purely experiments for him to mature in his movie making. Or perhaps that was just Following and Prestige wasn't my movie. The actors were very good and the acting was very good, the only thing I have to complain about is the movie. Okay, so, the point is that if I rate something I complain about higher than what I'm saying, it did it's part, but didn't use my part to complete it's part. Simple. Prestige is the movie that many people will love but many people will turn away from it. I think I'm a bigger fan of Nolan's blockbuster films and his more independent films I'll keep away from from now on. But if your his independent kind of fan and hate his Batman reboots and hate Inception, you'll probably end up loving this film. 6/10."
" Illusion In The Service Of Great Story Telling
",,"The art of prestidigitation is an apt metaphor for the contrived artifice of cinema. Christopher Nolan, like the master magicians depicted here, is intent on capturing our attention & imagination with his very skillful cinematic sleight of hand. And then in his bid for recognition as the ultimate showman, he risks his entire production on our natural human inclination to WANT to be deceived. He nudges & prods us into accepting this - our complicity in this deception - and then proceeds to taunt us for it. He smugly shows us the props & tools of his nefarious trade, and still he gains our confidence. As he entrances us with his magical visions we hand over to him our faith - and our cash. That's Hollywood, folks.This film is essentially a mystery thriller that is doubly confounding because we are continually being reminded that everything we are witnessing may well be an illusion. We are repeatedly put on notice that our perception of the film's reality is to be doubted, and therefor the reliability of the actions & identities can only be highly suspect. Yet we are compelled to persist in our assumptions, our suspicions, as Nolan is quite masterful at charming us deeper into his ploy. Just past the mid point of the film I became aware that I was being set up for an exceptionally confounding deception. And so I doubled my intense analysis & scrutiny of every action, of every character, of every word, intent on detecting a clue to the approaching ""twist."" I am not embarrassed to say that I did not figure it out. I was damn surprised by the very clever, very ingenious gimmick that is finally revealed. Only because the set up was so wonderfully watchable do I not resent this film's blatant manipulations. Just as you must respect, ultimately, anyone who fairly outsmarts you, I tip my hat to Christopher Nolan. And I am STILL not completely sure of what I witnessed.Hugh Jackman is a true Hollywood star and plays Robert Angier, an ambitious magician who competes with an old counterpart, Alfred Borden, for the title of finest in the land. Jackman's mere presence illuminates the screen, and he easily handles his character's subtle shifts in mood and tone. Christian Bale as his professional and then personal arch enemy certainly had the more challenging, less attractive role but somehow manages to maintain our sympathy. Michael Cain as Cutter, their one time boss and mentor is, as always, wonderfully natural & convincing. David Bowie, who previously seemed to always be playing a slightly grander version of his already expansive self, is here surprisingly low key and centered. He role was a fun, recurring element. But the women are a little less remarkable in their portrayals, as Scarlet Johansson's reading is often muddled and unfocused. She is, however, absolutely stunning to watch, her voluptuous curves and magical face seemingly created expressly for the big screen. Rebecca Hall as Alfred's put upon but loving wife is quite compelling despite her somewhat underwritten, sometimes clichéd role. As we are so emphatically informed at the outset of this fanciful con, the real trick, the real Prestige of a magical illusion is in bringing back the disappeared object or person. So, thus warned, I was eagerly anticipating the magical return of a vanished element. What or who should we expect to be returning is the persistent question that this film begs. And just as consistently, it foils and thwarts your every guess. The Prestige is remarkably effective at raising the bar on the challenge of openly conceding to us cinema's deviously dubious nature, while still dazzling us with its superior artistry."
" One of the better C.Nolan movies
",spoiler,"i must start by saying i am not a christopher nolan fan, i dislike most of his movies. most of his movies are just over the top with his know nothing to do but jumble the scenes so the people would be more impressed with the outcome in the end when he pours all the important scenes required to understand wat the hell is happening in a random order leaving your brain struggling to arrange the storyline together and forgetting all the details that usually doesn't make sense, quickly ending the movie in a really RUSHED manner, and all that just takes the fun away of any movie [1-develop lots of questions 2- deliver the answers in a highly compressed package 3- End] that wat CN does, and thats why i would never recognize him as one of the great directors like Spielberg, Osborn, Jackson. But in this movie although i did not know at the time CN made it i realized that halfway through and it was confirmed in the end where it was a little too 'Nolany' because they gave as little information/details as possible but was wrapped up nicely (the dark knight syndrome, which i hate BTW.) and i always have to ask my self is it really logical? can this happen in reality? or did he just put all those twists and turns to leave an impression. But in this movie i think it was best that CN direct it because of its nature but again it was a little too much to fully enjoy the movie. i think his brother JN made a good balance, and i feel contrary to many opinions that CN cannot portray/present a story but rather write it, so i don't like him as a director. the story itself was especially priceless because it ended the way i wanted to in favor of chritian bale, the movie was never slow exciting form the start i liked its pace excecpt the last 30 mins where it turned all 'Nolany'. and i need to watch it again to see if it will satisfy my highly logical mind, as there are still some tiny events that is not ironed out."
" The Prestige Review
",,"The Prestige is a brilliant story of revenge, jealousy, and obsession between two 19th century magicians. This movie really works because of the good performances, great direction from Christopher Nolan, and a story that keeps you guessing. Alfred Boden (Christian Bale), and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), start off as two magicians aides that are quite good friends. But after a series of unforgivable events, the two becomes enemies constantly trying to one-up each others work. This is when the story becomes a gripping revenge and obsession thriller, with each magician vying to create the perfect illusion. Jackman gives one of the best performances of his career as the emotionally tormented and obsessed Angier, a man who loses everything in order to create the ultimate trick that not even Boden can top. Bale gives a good enough performance, but he does come off as a smug jerk of a character throughout the majority of the film. The good acting as well as the intense direction really keeps you on the edge of your seat, and leaves you just as perplexed and frustrated as the magicians in terms of finding out how these illusions are performed. One thing I was worried about with this movie was that after going through many twists and turns, it wouldn't all tie together in a conceivable way. Once the movie reached its climax, however, the whole thing made complete sense and came together in a very nicely. Overall, this is a great obsession story that really makes you think, and also features good acting and near perfect direction. A definite must-see, especially for Christopher Nolan fans."
" Yeah... I'm thrilled again
",,It happens with every Nolan movie. The guy can't do anything wrong. Of cause we've got to give credits to Christopher Priest who came up with a great story and Nolan's brother Jonathan for helping hem. So it's about a... I don't know... a war I guess between two magicians. One is more of a showman and the other is obsessed with tricks. Well don't get me wrong they both obsessed but Christian Bales character is really obsessed. So for the most part the story runs in London in 19 century. Oh yeah good old London. And it's great because the city is beautiful. So the plot is incredible. I know you've heared it a lot but there are twists after twists. And when you think that there possibly can't be more they give you more. So that's that. The acting is great again as always in Nolan's film. He knows who to hire. I liked Bale and Caine the most. They're great(did I say great like 3 times?) Special effects are good I guess. Well it's not Dark Knight nor Inception there aren't so much but those which are there are great. So yeah there you have it. Another masterpiece by Nolan.
" The Prestige-Illusions of Mystery Betrayal Thriller
",,"This is a well crafted movie of a thriller mystery genre.To start with the movie has got all good casting.It brings in the flavor of magic in the movie by a perfect art direction and costumes of the cast especially.The place shown which are setting reflects the period of the story which gave the movie a nice ambiance.The magician's roles were well crafted by the director.Also best acting from both the lead magician's of the movie.The movie goes around with illusions and there are so many twists and betrayal in the plot which makes the movie interesting.Not much role for Rebbeca hall she comes and goes here and there in the story.Scarlet's role as portrayed well.The drawback was the overall length of the movieWatch out for a different thriller, mystery, betrayal.I would give 7.5 on 10."
" A magic trick in itself
",,"This twisted, cleverly plotted movie is a favorite of mine. The movie progresses like a magic trick which as you're told at the very outset by veteran genius Michael Caine's character has three parts: The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige. Analyze the movie after watching it and you can identify how well it fits into this description. Everything unfolds in front of your eyes but you still didn't watch while Nolan amazes you with a new trick from his seemingly inexhaustible bag of tricks. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play the obsessed magician roles perfectly while the cinematography and terrific production values set this mystery drama in Victorian London. One can uncover a few plot flaws on re-watch but that is because you know the secret. Once you know the secret, the magic is nothing."
" Great Movie but one major fault (spoilers included)
",spoiler,"I really like this movie. However one major fault i cant find a way around is why does Bale tie the hands of Jackmans wife while Jackman ties the feet? Bale has said he wants to tie a special knot which he is told not to do because it is a dangerous knot. So why not just have Bale tying the feet instead. If he does that then Jackmans wife doesn't drown and there is no story.... Also I watch bits of it the other night, tuning in and out throughout it, and I cant remember why Bale is so surprised when Jackman starts appearing on the balcony at the back of the theater with his version of the Transported Man. Bale has already sent Jackman to Tesla so why would Bale not be thinking that Jackman is just doing the same as him now? Why does bale just use his Transported Man trick to appear on the other side of the stage as opposed to far away, as Jackman is doing? I only though of this when i was watching bits of it ie i wasn't watching all or concentrating so i may well have overlooked something here. However the knot tying fault I cant think of a way around this... but apart from that though a great movie... very enjoyable indeed..."
" The best movie experience
",,"I must have watched this movie a 100 times bye now... its an awesome experience and shows the pure genius in Nolan. The movie is perfect in the sense it has a great story, portrayed by an immensely talented cast and directed by a genius... after this movie i ve become the biggest fan of Christian bale.The movie is all about the fight between 2 magicians and the quest of Angier to figure out the secret of the trick named ""the transporter man"". The movie successfully rides multiple story lines simultaneously and merges them beautifully at the end... The twist in the climax scene was breathtakingly awesome..No other suspense movie (usual suspects,6th sense, the illusionist) noting will be close enough to give a competition...Its a 10/10 and a must watch movie for anyone who loves sensible cinema."
" A Thrilling Magician's Tale!
",,"Christopher Nolan has turned out to be one of the best directors of this century so far. He made fantastic movies such as the two latest Batmans, Memento, and Inception. This is another movie to add to that list. It's not as good as those mentioned but this is a worthy addition especially with the excellent acting of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale.This takes place in London at the turn of the 20th Century. It tells the story of two rival magicians who will do nothing except get the best out of each other.The acting is solid. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were the ones who carried this movie. Of course, Scarlett Johansson looks as good as ever. Michael Caine also deserves some credit.Overall, this is a nice, dark-toned movie. I loved the setting background and the costumes. One side note, I could not recognize David Bowie. This is a great movie. I rate this movie 8/10."
" Batman vs Wolverine
",,"One of my favorite movie from Christopher Nolan, but what can I say the guy is a brilliant director. This film literally has style and substance, the plot with it's twist and turns will keep almost every audience entertained and intrigued. Even the ending is awesome and very original, it's those WTF kind of endings but in a good way. This movie isn't really a period piece although it takes place in Victorian era, it's more about the plot than the the time period and this was intentional as well and the plot is intricate and fascinating. It's basically about Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman who are magicians and basically rock stars of that time, going against each other and trying to beat each other at there own game, which leads to something much more. This movie is very entertaining and original, to the point right after I finished watching it I had to see it again.8.7/10"
" The Prestige
",,"In a period story full of plot twists and lengthy flashbacks, two friends and stage magicians called Robert Angier and Alfred Borden (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) start growing apart after a tragic accident during a show results in the death of Angier's wife. Both are keen on constantly one-upping each other's best tricks and dedicate themselves to their careers with the help of their loyal engineers who design new tricks for them. So tough is their competition that even family and lovers become secondary to them... Who will ultimately gain the upper hand in the battle of the two masterminds?The direction, cinematography and acting are all work of professionals. The dark visual style is skilfully created and the two leads are convincing, if a bit polished, in their roles. Of the supporting actors, the always good Michael Caine keeps stealing the show as usual, but Scarlett Johansson fits in her role of Angier's double-crossing assistant decently too. The complex narrative may seem unnecessarily twist-driven for its own good, but in the end the most interesting aspects of the film lie under the surface of the turns and revelations.As the story advances, the style becomes less and less interested in realism. After the introduction of the famous real-life inventor Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), elements of science fiction are introduced to the mix and strict demands of believability are better forgotten. The identities of the magicians, the difference between their acts and realities and the nature of their rivalrous friendship start becoming blurry and provide the actual meat of the film experience, as opposed to the less-than-credible plot turns that don't always feel quite right in the world of the story.While I feel the overall atmosphere could have been grittier and more down-to-earth, The Prestige provides a fairly absorbing tale of the effect of obsession on one's mind. Nolan has examined the theme of hidden or otherwise unclear identities in his other films too, so The Prestige easily fits in his body of work and fans of his style will enjoy it without a doubt. Personally I would like to see Nolan return to more small-scale cinema where the underlying themes wouldn't be buried under the need to wow the audience with constant spectacle, but in the meanwhile his big films are among the best output modern Hollywood has to offer in any case."
" The Prestige is a Magical piece.
",,"The Prestige is a movie about two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Agnier (Hugh Jackman) work as apprentices to Cutter (Michael Caine). During their work for him, one of the tricks suffers a terrible accident and Agnier develops an obsession for being better than Borden. When Borden develops a trick that Agnier can't figure out, things continue to escalate until both men are at each others throats.This movie is great. It plays with the time line and actually starts at the death of Robert Agnier. The viewpoint shifts between Borden and Agnier to keep you involved with both men, and while the movie goes through both men manage to become ambiguously protagonist and antagonist. The movie is a mystery, when the magicians develop tricks, you aren't told how they are doing their tricks right away. In a way, its like seeing a magic show while seeing the movie. The movie is filled with twists that keep you on the edge of your seat, though near the end it can seem like its getting dragged out a bit, you eventually catch up to the present events taking place and the actual ending to the story.Even though this is a great movie, its not without its flaws. Near the start in particular, it was hard to tell what was going on exactly because of the non-linear time line that the movie uses to tell the story. You might be confused a little bit on the characters and what all is going on for a good part of the opening, but it clears up quick enough, and maybe its just me. There's also a bit of a problem with the female characters. The main female characters, Borden's wife (Rebecca Hall) and the stagehand secondary love interest (Scarlett Johanson), manage to garner attention and seem to be written to be really important to the plot of the movie. Unfortunately, this just isn't realized very well, and by the end of the movie its questionable if they even had to be there in the first place, or if they were just put on to the set to be eye candy.Overall, The Prestige is a great movie, perfectly done and well performed. I haven't read the novel (yet) and therefore can't comment on how well it did with the source material, but from a basic movie stand point, it is very exciting, and a movie you should see, even if it doesn't take highest priority.8.5 out of 10."
" Are you watching closely?
",spoiler,"The Prestige, is yet another example of how talented is Christopher Nolan is at screen writing and film presentation. He has this thing of creating the illusion in the audience's mind and finally tricking or fooling them in the end. The film itself, is a trick, and it is up to the audience that whether they get themselves fooled or they find the reason behind it.As the novel, the film revolves around the obsessive rivalry between two fellow Magicians, Angier and Borden. They do a lot of hard work in cheating each other, defeating each other, and in the end -- None of them wins, exactly. The film is presented in different threads of story lines, which are interwoven together and near the end, these threads, produce the real picture, the reality. Outstanding work has been done for the film by both Nolan brothers for writing such a complex yet sophisticated adaptation of the novel. The film's plot joins the list of twisted ending films like the Sixth Sense.Production values are marvelous in the film. Cinematographer, Wally Pfister gets each and every shot perfectly pictured. The lighting, the colors are magnificent and they complement to the film's dark tone. It is, Wally Pfister's best work, so far. He really brings the chimera of the film through his camera. Editor Lee Smith, again, does a great job, perfectly pacing the film and getting the right scenes at right places. Production Designer Nathan Crowley's set are outstanding, the era of Victorian London of early 1900's is beautifully created by his team. However, music by David Julyan is underplayed or perhaps his score itself is bland, as compared to such an amazing film.This film is not Christopher Nolan's best, but yet it is very good, and will keep you on the edge of the seat until the secrets are revealed. Not to be missed. 8/10"
" A Beautiful Lie
",,"The Prestige is one of the most well crafted movies I've ever seen and it kept me thinking the whole time. Once I thought I understood it, something else came along and changed that. This lasted throughout the whole film and it wasn't frustrating, but extremely intriguing. Pacing was really good and I never lost interest. The story was actually very interesting to me and nothing like I've seen before. The ideas were brilliant and gave the movie the character and spirit it had. Completely original and didn't take from anything else. The performances were great and totally fit with the ending. (You'll see what I mean when you watch) The movie was a magician's act itself, and I would love to see it more than once."
" Christopher Nolan's Best Film
",,"With all the furore surrounding Inception, this is a good time to rediscover Nolan's earlier (and, it has to be said, much better) movie, The Prestige. The tale of two competing magicians in the 1800's, the film is blessed with great performances throughout and a story so ingenious, so convoluted, so beautifully realised that it will keep you guessing till the final frame and will have you discussing the story for days after first viewing. While it evidently didn't achieve the box office clout of Nolan's bigger films, this is nonetheless a superb piece of cinema and one that I would heartily recommend to anyone who appreciates an ingenious story.Philip Caveney"
" Don't watch the movie with some expectation
",spoiler,"I am not telling that this movie was worse as this movie actually is great treat. At the same time, I want to warn you not to watch this movie with some kind of expectation.I watched this movie, after reading many articles and reviews about this movie. After reading those reviews, I thought this movie will have no super hero magic stuff but just the magic that anyone could witness in the real world. So that this movie won't be fantasy but just a real movie. But this movie was not like that. The main trick, the guy getting into the electro machine and gets double like real magic and the doubled person coming out from another box kept somewhere too far. This is not practically possible for now.There is another two things that I am not satisfied with this movie.1. You try yourself to go in street, find a person who look just like you within weeks or even months. It seems THAT easy in this movie. Hero just like that wanted to find a person who looks exactly like him and he so easily finds a person who is like him. This also broke the reality feel I expected in this movie 2. A person is sent to death sentence for killing hero. But hero never died. And still he didn't try to save him. I was admiring him as the hero from the beginning till the end but only at end, I happen to understand his mean character that he no more cares about others life just because he want to shine in his business.Only because of those expectations I had before watching this movie, I got all these disappointments. If I had watched it without all of them, I would have enjoyed more and that is for sure.One more thing: It was predictable for me that Hero will be inside the water box in the last frame of the movie."
" A thinking man's director - a satisfying film - hard to classify
",spoiler,"THE PRESTIGE is a fascinating, satisfying if flawed look at magicians and passion through the lens of a thinking man's director using details of turn of the century history as his palate. Most satisfying if you're up to following the unexpected details, but it must have been frustrating for the releasing studio to try and figure our how to SELL the film when it first came out.Is it a simple classic costume mystery? (It isn't) Do you give away that there may be science fiction elements? (They didn't - to even hint that there may have been some inspiration in the STAR TREK series and its fictional technology might have been a major spoiler, but without buying into that concept, the film has a serious logistic flaw - and the mere incorporation of references to the period science - heavily extrapolated - of Nicholas Tesla wasn't enough to get the point across for many) Are the great Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale big enough stars to simply sell it as a vehicle? (At that point they weren't) The film didn't find its initial audience and went to DVD all too soon, but it's rightly developing a fair cult now, because it IS a fascinating experience for audiences knowledgeable enough to bring at least some awareness of Nicholas Tesla (the Sci-Si Channel's great series EUREKA has helped a lot on this front), willing to actually pay attention to Nolan's complex story telling which uses the flash-back and flash-forward more effectively than most recent films, willing to take a leap of faith or two and anxious to enjoy the excellent work from a uniformly superb cast and director.It is all too tempting to see the first shadings of director Nolan's lighter but more complex ""thinking man's extravaganza,"" INCEPTION, in THE PRESTIGE. Both are films which require an audience willing to pay full attention and actually LISTEN, not just lie back and wait for the car crashes and exploding buildings to entertain them. Both are stories which use the pain of lost love to unexpected advantage motivating their core characters. Both are immensely rewarding to those willing to THINK and not just absorb.In the film and real life ""the prestige"" is a magician's term for the final reveal which makes a trick pay off. On DVD, THE PRESTIGE is a prestige item serious film buffs will want to savor more than once."
" Prestigious Film About Magic
",spoiler,"Christopher Nolan always seems to satisfy us with a unique story or way of telling the story. In The Prestige, he does a bit of both. This film about competing magicians who grow increasingly contemptuous of each other is set during the spiritualist craze of Victorian London. Like a Sherlock Holmes story, it feeds us hidden clues carefully woven into its dialog and plot. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are equally compelling and reprehensible as the two competing magicians, and Piper Perabo and Rebecca Hall are the two hapless women in their respective lives. Michael Caine is the marketer and mentor of Hugh Jackman. Scarlett Johansson is the young girl who shifts from one to the other, playing an assistant and mistress. David Bowie is the enigmatic Tesla, disappearing almost completely into character. As with his last film, Batman Begins, Nolan's film contains sumptuous art and set direction, cinematography, and costumes. The soundtrack is also not intrusive, although the audibility of the dialog and volume of the sound throughout the film seem quite low. The film is Hitchcock-like in that its success relies more upon how its executed than individual actors and/or plot points. The film-maker tries distracting us like a magician with shifts in time and points of view changes. It's truly a mesmerizing, multi-layered, and thought-provoking film. Although the film's puzzle may ultimately be deciphered by the discerning viewer, it should not spoil the enjoyment the film provides. However, the fact the film is rated so high on the IMDb's top 250 list is more a tribute to the idea people like to be fooled than its greatness as a film. ***1/2 of 4 stars."
" nolan is definitely one of the best director

",,"I think most of the reviews here cover the finer points of this film. Yes, it's a terrific story, with a fantastic cast, with Christian Bale once again giving a flawless performance. Yes, the direction is superb, and further confirms Christopher Nolan as a master of his art. Yes, it's a great film, and well worth a couple of hours of anyone's time.However, two things bugged me about it, which I feel compelled to warn others about. The first problem was Scarlett Johansson. I don't particularly rate her as an actress anyway, but here she's really bad. How other people can suggest she gives a solid performance must surely mean 'solid' as in 'stiff' (as in 'wooden'). Yes, she's pretty, but she's also pretty unconvincing and her English accent, while an admirable attempt, still falls some way short.The other thing that threatened to spoil my enjoyment of The Prestige was the utterly bizarre decision to cast David Bowie as Nicolas Tesla. At the best of times, he's a mediocre actor. On a positive note, this was one of those times, so he was at the top of his game, in a sense. Sadly, when he's on form, he's still crap, and his accent was nothing short of hilarious. I'm not sure what it was meant to be, but it sounded like the voice Ricky Gervais does at the start of his 'Animals' show - a kind of weird French, German, via North London affair.There was one other thing that bothered me, which is the stuff about Hugh Jackman's 'machine'. It's totally ridiculous and doesn't fit with the tone of the film at all. I won't say any more than that, as I don't want to add any spoilers.In spite of these issues though, the rest of The Prestige is so good it's easily worth eight out of ten."
" Great film! Very under-rated!
",,"You can't even begin to write a comment for this film without trying to give the plot away. Christopher Nolan has really shown his depth and imagination with this film. Its fantastically edited and directed. It's cleverly narrated through two magicians diaries, one reading the others of past events, with several scenes deployed in the middle which show current events.The film is about two magicians, Borden (Bale) & Angier (Jackman) who become rivals after an accident at a show (that they have been performing before), where the magician on stage picks two members from the audience (ie: Bale and Jackman), they tie up Angier's partner by the hands and feet. She goes into the glass cage filled with water...from here on - the rivalry starts. Throughout the film, Bale & Angier are determined to get the better of each other by coming up with better tricks, but the film takes such a dark twist into something more sinister, which is what the makes the film's conclusion so great and simple. It's not until Borden perfoms the most greatest trick that Angier has ever seen, that he is determined to better Borden's. This leads onto a great exploration of one person's desperation to seek his true goal in life, to become the greatest magician over Borden.A lot of people here say ""Oh it was predictable"" - maybe it was, but then, you still don't expect even when you know the truth.It's a film that didn't really give the impact that it probably should of done on the public, it wasn't a huge film publicity wise, but its a great film with a magnificent story, and the acting is second to-none. Cane, Johansson and Bowie do fanatastic jobs as sub characters - although Johansson's English accent is one to be questioned.Overall its a really enjoyable film, a tiny bit long, but the story drags you in to make you watch it to the end. Top purchase on DVD! Go buy!"
" One in a Million.
",,"There are occasions, when you know, you have seen something amazing. Something you don't see quite often. In movies, Prestige is definitely that something. I left the cinema with the feeling that I have seen an amazing movie, comparison to which I can hardly find. There were some good movies that came out recently, but Prestige is truly one in a million.Prestige belongs to the mystic genre of movies. It's mystic not only because there's a mysticism, but also because of the indirect narrator's style. It belongs with movies such as : Sixth Sense, The Butterfly Effect, Donny Darko, The I inside, Angel Heart, The jacket etc ... . Can't say it's the best in the category, but I definitely enjoyed it more than anything I listed.The ending twist point was already done before ( Snapdragon, Les Rivières pourpres ). But as Michael Caine's character stated : You have got to know how to sell the trick. The outstanding way this twist point was sold to us, the viewers, makes the whole movie original.The interesting plot and the perfect performance make this movie enjoyable, and unforgettable. I'm definitely going to buy this movie on DVD to watch again with my friends and family.Just watch it!!!!!!!!!"
" Wonderfully dark and tense atmosphere (Possible spoilers)
",,"Cristopher Nolan does it again! He is definitely someone to watch in the future. In THE PRESTIGE he creates a wonderfully dark and tense atmosphere, thanks to excellent use of music and superb cinematography and set design. There is hardly any day exteriors at all. The approach of scrambling the continuity works fine here and makes you pay extra attention, soon it will become such an often used device that audiences probably wont even notice. The acting is overall uniformly excellent, Michael Caine stands out as a center of gravity for the plot and the rest of the ensemble. Even David Bowie has improved his acting with age, and now also has great authority and weight, he hardly registers as ""Bowie"" at all. What you will make of the payoff is probably very individual, I thought it fitted the slightly surreal and dreamlike ambiance the rest of the movie had. The cinematography, as I mentioned, is stunning. It must have been an ordeal for the focus puller, since it is anamorphic, mostly hand-held, and often shot in under-lit locations."
" An excellent Thriller
",,"First off, let me tell you some other movies I like in this Genre.The Usual Suspects, The Inside Man, Phone Booth - Movies where the plot is never standing still; There's always something happening, and you always want to know what's happening.As The Prestige started, I was thinking that it could be alright, but it was a lot lot more. It was AMAZING.An extremely good script, and an even better plot.A good performance by Scarlet Johanssen, A great performance by Michael Caine, a fantastic performance by Hugh Jackman, and an outstanding one by Christian Bale, tied together with one of the best, most original twists ever, gives you a movie that you'll be thinking about for the rest of the day.The twist was so good in fact, that about 24 hours after watching it, I was still thinking ""Oh man, that was excellent!!!"""
" Good film experience
",,"Enough positive comments have been made about this film BUT I didn't get the ending! Could someone tell me what happens at the VERY end: Who dies & who doesn't? Replies to salamu@iprimus.com.au appreciated.I cannot think of any more to comment but I'm being asked to write 10 lines! So I hope this extra will be accepted! Does anyone else have this problem? Why can't we only write a few lines? Beats me.Casting was good with Bale turning out the most impressive performance to date. Jackman not as impressive. Bale was the more contained & restrained. The brief appearance of ex-Gollum would have gone unnoticed had my husband not pointed it out, as with Bowie acting as Tesla, and a nice job he did too. Now that must be 10 lines surely!"
" holds you but isn't always easy to follow
",,"Intricate, serpentine thriller—not a surprise since it's co-written and directed by Christopher Nolan—set toward the turn of 20th century London about two ambitious magicians, one a charismatic seeker of fame with a penchant for showmanship, the other a sly and dazzling illusionist, who are devoted partners until their greatest trick goes tragically awry. Torn apart by their resentment and mutual desire to be the best, they become bitter enemies who'll stop at nothing to learn each other's secrets, and their rivalry escalates into a lifelong obsession of deceit and sabotage. Slow at first, but the story is interesting, the two leads are formidable (Jackman lively and flamboyant, Bale mysterious and subdued), and there's a lot of chicanery and hocus pocus to please the eye, but the plotting is confusing, almost incomprehensible at times, and the ending feels contrived. Still, director Nolan does a good job of building suspense and intrigue, but you'd probably have to watch it multiple times to appreciate all the skill and craft. **½"
" betrayal,deceit and loss
",,"i watched both ""The Illusionist"" and then this movie ""The Prestige"" in my mind both are very good movies.both of them deal with illusion,but the similarity ends there for the most part.they are two very different movies.""The Illusionist""is very low key,almost sublime.the story of ""The Prestige"" is more vivid in its presentation.it's on a grander scale,if you will.it has a bigger scope.there are plot twists in both movies,but many more in ""The Prestige"".it almost demands a 2nd viewing to fully understand it.this movie is,at it's core,a movie about betrayal,deceit and loss.there are some well known heavy weights in the movie.all put in very good performances.however,the two people i was most impressed by are Piper Perabo and Scarlett Johansson.i think Piper is very talented and underutilized in the industry.she always has an understated quality in every role.Scarllet impressed me with both her acting and her flawless British accent.i thought it was flawless,anyhow.both actresses hold their own very well.as for the movie itself,i think it is as good as ""The Illusionist"" for some of the same reasons and many different reasons.my rating for ""The Prestige"" is an 8.5/10"
" What prestige to pull a trick that costs your soul?
",spoiler,"An apocryphal Nikola Tesla played by the phenomenal David Bowie as the undoing of two rivals is what really makes for the film based on a book from UK sf novelist Christopher Priest.For my part, it was Hugh Jackman's character of Rupert Angier obsessing over revenge that led him to his dark path; while Bale's Bowden character in literally leading a double life and never letting himself take the blame which led to his near destruction.Michael Caine as the man who taught them both was an endearing and yet clever touch... The theory that Tesla had mastered alternating current to the degree he had and thus creating the ultimate Prestige was in and of itself intriguing.I see many tricks that were conducted in the movie were advised by David Copperfield, yet the Hugh Jackman specialty at the end of the movie can be clearly seen as a variation on a popular trick from Criss Angel.The plotting, acting as well as cinematography are all worthy of Oscars not 2 forget the costume and art direction and layout - very prestigious, I look forward to checking the book now! http://bajanreporter.blogspot.com"
" A magically wonderful film
",spoiler,"Very rarely does a film tell you exactly what's going to happen within the first five minutes. And it's one in a billion that the movie still keeps you on the edge of your seat right up until you say ""Oh my god"" at the end. Such is the new thriller ""The Prestige"".Brothers Jonathan and Christopher Nolan (writer and director, respectively) team up again for the first time since 2000's ""Memento"" to adapt Christopher Priest's novel about two magicians in the late nineteenth century, dueling for supremacy. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) start their careers as audience plants for an aging magician. After the untimely death of Angier's wife, which he blames Borden for, the two separate and challenge each other for best entertainer in London. As they progress the challenge further and further, it begins to get dangerous for the two men, both sustaining sever injuries.Angier has greater means at his disposal, enlisting the help of his manager Cutter (Michael Caine), assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johnasson) and famed physicist/engineer Nikola Tesla (David Bowie). But Borden is craftier; having the most magnificent trick that Angier just can't figure out.Nolan is one of the most intriguing directors of this generation. His films unfold in a way that's conducive to the actual plot of the movie. ""Memento"" was told backwards, so we had the same feeling of being lost as the main character. In ""The Prestige"", Caine explains the structure in the form of a magic act. First act is the pledge, the set up the exposition, as with any story. The turn is where we see that there's something more to the story than meets the eye. And the titular prestige, that's the payoff, the wow factor. And it's an amazing payoff. They tell you to expect the unexpected, but you're still fascinated and glued to your seat.The film is presented in a very dark and sinister manner, which accentuates the escalating duel between the magic men. It's the same tone Nolan brought to the resuscitated ""Batman"" franchise.It's a supremely talented cast that Nolan was able to put together, everyone at the top of their game. Jackman is the real stand-out, breaking away from his action persona he's carved for himself and taking on a demanding dramatic role that showcases his true talent. Bale continues his impressive streak as one of the top actors of this generation. He has this intense screen presence that very few others have and is just mystifying. You could see it in ""American Psycho"" and ""Batman Begins"", his performance is what really made those films, and helps propel this one. But I can't forget the scene stealer in Bowie. He plays the role of Tesla very dark and restrained, giving him this air of creepiness.I can't wait to see what the sibling auteurs do with future projects (including a ""Batman Begins"" sequel), but if their tried and true track record holds, we're in for a cinematic treat."
" Pledge, Turn ,Prestiges everywhere!
",,"Besides the two main characters rivalry, and the notable overall Nolan's trick i d like to mention: -very suitable Scarlet Yohansson's acting cause it meant to be flat. (She's the blond assistant remember?!!). Watch out for her trick. -Kane is great cause his acting is suitable for someone who just cannot be the magician. Besides that he plays all the same to me. Every f. time. Anyway watch how works his trick in the plot as the assistant's above.SPOILER follows!The film was so compact! You can't take anything out. I ll only criticize Nolan on the bit early focusing on the engineer character. Too early focus i think.Anyway, among the best ever! dz"
" Excellent, but David Bowie was for me the unexpected triumph
",,"I loved the film for many reasons. But one of them is an element of the film that will probably be ignored by most other reviewers so I feel the need to underline it: David Bowie in this movie did the unbelievable. He performed a character who is *more* conventional in every possible way than he himself is. The way he found to totally camouflage his own outstanding (exceptionally weird) self and to invoke an entirely different self who beamed a totally different intensity is ...obscure to me. Astoundingly artful.In a way, he captured the greatness of the character he had played in the ""Man Who Fell to Earth"" by being someone entirely different. And (coincidence?) the character he plays in ""The Prestige"" (the real historical person) is also rumoured to have ""fallen to Earth"". Plus he had a similar lifepath to the character David Bowie played in the ""Man Who Fell to Earth"" - but a radically different persona, a mesmerizingly stable, solid presence with intent and intensity. A perception bender. Prestigious prestidigitation.Petros, ttetpos@yahoo.com"
" Fantastic, the second time around.
",,"This movie has a lot of twists and I admit I was confused the first time around.Watch it again and everything makes sense. It seems a little more confusing then it actually is. Whatever you are thinking what is going on, you are probably right.2 magicians in 20th century London, played by Hugh Jackman (Angier)and Christian Bale (Borden), go to desperate attempts to try and out do each other.Michael Caine was fabulous as an adviser/manager of Angier.I think Scarlett Johannson is a terrible actress and she disappointed in this movie as well, luckily you are so intrigued by the 2 main stars you don't care.One of my faves this year. 8/10."
" The Obsession
",,"On the surface this movie was about a rivalry between two magicians to prove who was best at his craft. But deeper than that lied love, revenge, and obsession over their craft.""The Prestige"" was about two magicians that were once partners and a tragic accident made them bitter adversaries. This movie, like a good magician, held my attention throughout. The two magicians were constantly trying to one-up each other to the point that they would sabotage each others act. Even though I thought the rivalry was a bit juvenile, I still wanted to see what each of them would come up with next to outdo the other.These two were so utterly obsessed with their craft that they risked life and limb to be the best. They were entrenched in a battle with each other so fierce that the ending could only be tragic unless they both woke up and realized the perilous path they were upon.I gave the movie high marks for its story and its successful attempts to captivate me and hold my attention until the end."
" Less adventurous than Memento, but plenty of fun
",,"""Step right up folks, for the next entertaining and annoying confection from the clever Nolan brothers, who make a perfectly credible plot disappear before your very eyes and send you out of the theatre with a warm glow but also with a vague feeling you've been had."" Actually I think my anonymous sideshow barker is being a bit harsh, for this particular confection, viewed as sheer entertainment, has a lot going for it. . First, there are two strong performances from Hugh Jackman, and Christian Bale as the two dueling magicians (or is it illusionists?), Robert Angier and Alfred Borden. Then there's a faultless supporting performance as Michael Caine, in wise old buffer mode, as Cutter, the trick deviser. Then there's the invocation of the late Victorian/Edwardian atmosphere, when society seemed to be so straitlaced and stratified, yet unimaginable change was already on its way. Lastly, there's the paradox that even though, especially via Cutter, we get to see the magic business from the inside, what's really going on is concealed until the end  and possibly beyond.This is a long movie - over 120 minutes and I did get a little restless at times. The intensity of the rivalry between the male leads tends to put their women in the shade, and Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall were rather overshadowed (though Rebecca does the better of the two). Although the Tesla sub-plot was interesting, and David Bowie was a suitably cagey Tesla (the real-life electrical inventor), the leap into rather fuzzy sci-fi was rather out of sympathy with the main themes of the picture, putting on illusions and getting revenge. Still without Tesla there would not have been Andy Serkis's gem of a performance as his sidekick Alley.As in ""Memento"" where the story was essentially presented backwards, Christopher Nolan plays around with the time-frame, but much more conventionally. Thus the movie opens with Borden in jail after being convicted of Angier's murder, but of course that is not the end of the story. The storyline is not a challenge until the end when rather too much is revealed at once. Still, the stars are easy to watch and the music-hall atmosphere beautifully evoked. Whether or not Tesla could do remarkable things with black cats and top hats, not to mention people, is beside the point; the story here is powered by good old human passion."
" Raising the stakes in this tale of illusions and revenge
",,"Director Christopher Nolan has gone from quirky,disturbing mystery director(Following,Memento)to mind f--er(Insomnia) to dark action movie director(Batman Begins)and with the Presitge,back to mind f--er.One-time friends,cohorts and now rival magicians in Victorian England,Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman,who seems to be in everything lately)and Alfred Borden(Christian Bale,returning to his native accent)engage in a war of out-doing each other and,possibly,doing harm to each other as they try to outwit and out-perform each other,both looking to perfect and improve upon the art of creating the perfect illusion. The fuel for their rivalry isn't entirely in their heads:Borden's inexplicable inability to save Angier's wife(Piper Perabo)from a botched escape routine has set Angier out to make his act not just an act but a personal vendetta to destroy Borden,and Angier's ruining of Borden's first public performance(along with part of Borden's right hand),steels Borden to sabotage and monitor his old chum's performances.Years later,when it appears that Borden has found a way to near-flawlessly perform the ""Transported Man"" routine,Angier goes to great lengths--specifically,the mountains of Colorado--to look up charismatic and mysterious inventor Nikola Tesla(a saturnine,mesmerizing and brunette David Bowie)to help with a contraption that will enhance the act. The contraption proves to be a much more powerful device,one that threatens to destroy whomever uses it. Or does it?The neat thing,to me,about magic/con movies is that they always challenge the viewer to keep up with it. They may not always succeed,but they at least try to keep the viewer from being passive. Such is the case with this film,which is visually enchanting and acted nicely. The leads,in particular,are studied and focused as increasingly bitter rivals. Michael Caine is fantastic as their mentor,a sage and patient man who senses that he has little power over what's about to happen and merely wants to stay out of the way. The lovely Scarlett Johnnson makes the most out of her late addition character,an attractive magician's assistant who is brought up by Angier but finds herself smitten with Borden.Mood and atmosphere are important here,and this film makes the most of it. It may not be perfect,and it did seem like it left a few too many plot lines to dangle,but overall,it was effective,and that's what should count. As one of the lines in the movie exhorts you the viewer to do:watch closely."
" An awesome and magical film
",spoiler,"I have to say, when I walked into my local theater to see ""The Prestige"" I did not expect this film to be anything special, but I was taken for a huge surprise and I walked out with an indelible experience.The plot was wicked and suspenseful and fun to watch unfold, but even more watchable were most of the performances that rounded out the film, making it all the more worthwhile. My main reason for seeing this film was Christian Bale, who totally delivered, but so did Hugh Jackman (although I would have preferred if he kept an English accent the first half of the film), Michael Caine (no surprise there), as well as David Bowie (who did surprise me) and Rebecca Hall. Everyone was solid, except Miss Johansson who dished out an utterly unfulfilling and dull performance which went nowhere and did nothing for the movie.At any rate, the film was great and I'll definitely be going back to see this."
" An amazingly well-thought out film lost in imperfect retelling
",spoiler,"Two magicians, Angier and Borden, become arch enemies following the accidental death of Angier's wife during a magic trick. The conflict between them escalates as they desperately seek to create the perfect human-transportation trick.I found it profoundly difficult to follow the plot for a good first half of The Prestige, and for good reason, I believe. Two people, both dressed in black for the most part of the film, both engaged in magic tricks, both with a similar build, composed the soul of the story. Yet, it was hard for me to tell both of them apart, or indeed identify them as the main characters when they appear. In fact, seeing the movie poster again after watching the movie, I realised that the two faces on the poster does seem like the same person. To add to the difficulty of telling the characters apart, both main characters disguised themselves at some parts of the film, and it happens that understanding who is who at these portions is crucial to an understanding of the plot.In addition, cuts that messed up the chronology could also have been found throughout the film. Some were crucial for an effective and impactful climax and resolution. Others, especially the relentless flashbacks to the prison scene, only serves to show off the director's knowledge of the flashback as a story-telling device, and ultimately leaves the viewer very confused.After two hours of intricate building-up of the conflict, the story reveals with cunning and wit how certain elements of the plot were even possible. At the same time, it raises germane and thought-provoking issues, challenging the viewer's original perception of certain things in the story.What makes the concluding revelation all the more keen was how it could have been guessed prior to the revealing itself. Clues, like the duplicated cats and hats, and key elements, like the revolver and the water tank, were already known to the viewer, and all it took was a missing link to conceal the actual dynamics of the plot. This allowed the revelation to be done elegantly and without being a forced reconciliation of the plot.An amazingly well-thought out film lost in imperfect retelling: that's my feel on The Prestige."
" The Prestige is Nolan's masterpiece!
",,"With The Prestige Christopher Nolan has crafted a masterpiece of a mind bender, in essence, he has created a cinematic magic trick (much like the novel is a literary magic trick). Everyone is in absolute perfect form and you can tell that at this point, everyone in terms of Nolan's crew, is right on the same plane. The performances are top notch, Hugh Jackman shows us range and emotion that he has not yet displayed on the screen. Wally Pfisters cinematography is absolutely radiant, capturing the light and shadows and bringing another time period alive. Nathan Crowley's production design is impeccable, he has constructed complex and detailed sets that evoke the time period and the atmosphere of this rather dark film. For me to say that this is Nolan's best film so far is certainly tough. All of Nolan's films are masterpieces in their own right, but I think that The Prestige is a knock-out. I can only hope that come Oscar time, this film and all of the individuals involved are remembered for their flawless film-making."
" An excellent movie
",,"The Prestige was a wonderful movie. It had great actors, a great storyline (though sometimes kinda confusing), and was a great thriller. Although I knew the actors playing the characters, I was so into the movie I did not see Hugh Jackman or Christian Bale. I just saw their characters, and that means that they did a good job. I was always hooked on the storyline and was never bored throughout the whole story. I just wanted to see what would happen to the characters. My only problem was that it was kinda confusing. The good guy was the bad guy and vice versa, and the whole concept of cloning was tough to understand, but they ended it very well and in a way that I understood the whole thing. That whole day all I was thinking about was that movie."
" The Prestige- 2 magicians in battle
",,"BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!! If you are human you will love this movie. I can't believe even 1.1% of people thought this movie was awful this movie deserves a 73289754093 out of 10. If you want to see a movie that shows you the dangers of obsession, this is the movie for u (and also for people who don't want to see a movie about that.) Good for over people 12 and over. No sex scenes, but contains blood at times. There is no movie better than this one. After I watched it I watched another movie (Bridget's Jones's Diary) and I couldn't appreciate it because it just wasn't The Prestige. That is only bad part about it, I can never watch another movie in the same way. It will take Hollywood years to top it."
" Great movie
",spoiler,The Prestige is a movie done by the same man who did Memento and batman begins. It is a moderately dark tale of two magicians. I left the movie talking with friends about the intricate plot. Hugh Jackman and Christian bale play their roles superbly. The only fault is the characters not being particularly likable.However you forgive the writers towards the end. Hugh Jackman is very different from his role as wolverine. Anyone who has read the book by Christopher priest would not enjoy it as much. However the book presents an interesting viewpoint to the movie. David Bowie and Andy Serkis are funny. Andy Serkis longs for that cod piece so well known as Gollum's own. This movie i enjoyed because it is a clever roller-coaster ride of emotions. you feel great disgust for Hugh Jackman's character at the end. Him killing himself each night is a fantastic twist and the end part where you see the large amount of boxes filled with Hugh Jackman's body and Michael Caine's narration is fantastic. I felt that Hugh Jackman would be the good guy. And was surprised when he was evil
" Okay Plot but Great Character Development
",,"I was pleasantly surprised by this movie. The plot is perhaps a little thin, and often asks the audience to take great leaps of faith or insults their intelligence. Where The Prestige really shines is in it's ability to convey a message about the nature of obsession through its two main characters, rival magicians Borden (Bale) and Angiers (Jackman).Will The Pretige keep you on the edge of your seat with heart pounding action and excitement? No. But if you're looking for some food for thought and a good topic of discussion among people with more sophisticated movie tastes, I highly recommend it."
" When the Magic is Missing
",,"The Prestige Director Christopher Nolan (""Memento"") pulls out all the stops for his latest film, the thrillingif emotionally voidThe Prestige, in which the strapping Hugh Jackman (""X-Men"") and Christian Bale (""Batman Begins"") face off against each as two magicians locked in a never-ending game of one-upmanship. Set in turn-of-the-century London, the film unfolds via flashbacks and flash-forwards that keep the audience guessing, unraveling the back story behind the murder mystery that serves as the backdrop of the plot. As the film begins, Alfred Borden (Bale) is locked a prison cell awaiting sentencing for killing someone, and that the identity of the unknown deceased comes as no great shock when it is revealed in the second act is only part of the film's troubles.As we learn, Borden and fellow illusionist Richard Angier (Jackman, nicely shedding extended claws and rubber suits for snappy tuxedos and top hats) were once colleagues whose partnership came to an end following a tragedy caused by one of Borden's too-risky magic tricks. After parting ways, the men end up haunting each other's livesstealing each other's tricks, doing underhanded deeds, and transgressing in ways that only alpha males driven by ego and showmanship can do.The film moves along at a brisk pace, its story punctuated by jumps back and forth in time and thrilling sequences of the men performing their awe-inspiring tricks onstage. The stakes are rather highindeed, matters of life and death are often up for grabs; yet for all the drama and heartache alluded to in the script, the film is ultimately a triumph only in style over substance. As he did in the similarly gimmicky ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia,"" Nolan places all the emphasis on events rather than characters, pulling audiences along on the adventure but never really giving us the emotional payoff the story truly deserves.Which is a shame. Jackman and Bale both deliver commendable performances, with Scarlett Johansson luminous as always as the criminally underwritten assistant who becomes a pawn in their game of revenge. The film is also gorgeously shot and briskly directed, drawing one into the time period with such authenticity to detail yet driven by a contemporary pacing that the late 19th century feels like it could have happened just yesterday. The plot twists are often surprising as well; Nolan (working with brother Jonathan on the screenplay) is certainly a master at delivering surprises at every turn. But, ""Batman Begins"" excepted, Nolan's downfall as a director is his maddening inability to connect to his own characters. Like the feuding magicians depicted here, The Prestige merely gives the illusion of a satisfying period thriller. You may leave the theater feeling elated, but the effect wears off quickly, leaving you with the opinion that Nolan is a talented director who could afford to get himself a new bag of tricks. Grade: B."
" A dark, intense intriguing journey of rival magicians filled with unpredictable twists and turns.
",spoiler,"You won't have a problem paying close attention to this mesmerizing and sometimes shocking plot, but if your attention wanders even for a moment, you'll be lost in the end. I'm still explaining details to my husband of the unexpected ending, where and when the details were set up earlier, and how and why. He totally missed the fact that Borden was not the most evil after all, but that Angier was the worst of the two. He missed catching onto the fact that Borden had created his own double (a real twin?), but kept him around as a constant companion, confidante and equal partner - while Angier murdered each double immediately after the great trick was finished and his usefulness was ended.Few movies will succeed in keeping me in the dark for so long with their unpredictability, but this one surely did.

You will want to watch it again, to catch it. One question will haunt you. Was it magic? ""Prestige"" is certainly movie magic, there is no doubt about that. After having waited in anticipation for many months for ""Prestige"", I was pleased to have it exceed my expectations. Starring Christian Bale (""Batman""), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine from ""X-Men""), Scarlett Johansson (The Island), Rebecca Hall, and Michael Caine (Secondhand Lions, Alfred from ""Batman""), ""Prestige"" is certainly filled with prestigious people. The cast also include Piper Perabo, Andy Serkis (Gollum), and David Bowie.Chris Bale and Jackman play two magicians who begin as friends, but the friendship turns to obsessive rivalry when tragedy strikes. Bale is obviously the better magician, but Jackman has flair. When Bale performs ""the greatest magic trick he's ever seen"", Jackman decides to get even and the make a name for himself at the same time. Their hatred for each other puts Bale's wife and child and Scarlett Johansson in the middle of it all. The danger increases and the intensity rises as the men make attempt after attempt to outwit the other.Chris Bale and Michael Caine had the most impressive acting, and I loved every minute they were on camera. That's not to say that Johansson and Jackman aren't great too. Surprisingly, Bowie gives a pretty good performance, not at all reminiscent of ""The Labyrinth"", which is a relief.According to Caine's character, ""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The magician makes his ordinary some thing do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" The magician of this movie is the director, and the actors who make his film come alive. When you see ""The Prestige"", you will see something shocking you've never seen before. You will look for the secret, but you won't find it. Because of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. Interestingly enough, movies, just like illusions, consist of three acts. ""The Prestige"" converts a film into a magic trick. If you think you have it all figured out, think again. Because the only parts you've seen are the Pledge and the Turn. The Prestige is still to come."
" An intricate story line with superb twists
",,"I was intrigued with the trailers of this movie and thought they did it justice.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were excellent in their roles!I could almost feel their anguish and anger as each part of the movie unfolded.I was very pleased how they worked their diaries/journals into the plot with surprising results.Jealousy and hate were mixed in with their admiration of each other.Scarlett Johansen is remarkable in her role and is always a welcome addition to any successful movie.Michael Caine was wonderful and added beautifully to the support and the success of this movie.David Bowie was also a pleasant surprise. I feel he was highly believable as the reclusive scientific genius.In summation, I am happy to had the opportunity to view this movie. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves mystery and intrigue."
" Even if you know the ""big"" trick, it's worth watching
",,"Spoilers follow Unfortunately I had seen a new Outer Limits episode (nothing about magicians) that was very relevant about sacrifice and moral choices inherent in the science employed. Nolan offered clues very early (depiction of the reason for the trial, Caine's comments about the sailor, and Jackman walking past the hats on his first trek up the hill)combined with the OL episode, on the secret. The more interesting parts were how each man sacrificed along the way, not trying to hurt anyone but themselves, and leaving a lot of damage in their wake.Is there a disconnect between Caine's supposed knowledge of the trick, demonstrated to the judge, and his decision near the end? Surely the visiting judge did not take at face value that the machine just ""worked."" Is that how bird tricks really work? Surely, performers can't do that stuff these days. Every time I saw Bale in his studio with those numerous bird cages along the window, it gave me a pause. I'm sure that was Nolan's intention because they are prominent visual and auditory feature of every scene in that studio. It was a great way to demonstrate that performing magic is about life and death."
" There is more to it than meets the eye...
",spoiler,"I saw this film this afternoon with an open-mind, having no clue as to what it was about it. Seeing a few of Chris Nolan's movies, I knew it was going to be good. Boy, it blew me way away! i'll try not to give too much of the story away, (for it is so cunning and amazing with scheming). It's about two magicians in competition (Jackman) and (Bale) who try to gain fortune and glory, but also learn and reveal to the masses of the ultimate magic trick. both set off in a face/off of lies, deceit, obsession, greed, pride, and murder that can lead to serious consequences. That's all I'm going to reveal of the story, for it is so cunning and amazing with scheming that when yo think you've figured it out...think again! It has a powerful all-star cast. Hugh Jacman and Christain Bale were an awesome couple of foes, who deserve some recognition in the Oscars. especially Jackman, for he plays a very ambivalent character; not to mention the rest, Scarlett Johansen was both good-looking and had talent, Michael Caine was absolutely fabulous, which he always was, and a surprise guest star of Andy Serkis was also really decent in his role.The film-making was mind-blowing, with realistic looking visual effects, that didn't look CGI, even though they probably were, the set-decoration and costume design, was vivid, and the music score gave a very depressing, but moving feeling, that made the film flow even more. However, the film made unexpected changes from scene to another with a lot of choppy editing, which came very untimely, making the film very confusing and hard to follow. The pace was also relatively slow, for the two hour film felt more like three hours.otherwise, this is one of this year's best films! it has pretty much everything a good film needs, acting, story, and film-making quality. Chris Nolan has pulled it off again! ***1/2 out of **** See it, it is worthwhile!"
" Terrific
",,"Since I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone who hasn't seen it yet, I will simply explain the basics. Two rival magicians compete with each other to see who is the better magician. Hugh Jackman's character becomes obsessed with one of Christian Bale's magic tricks and tries to discover Bale's method. Throughout the story, many twists and turns arise and I found the movie to get better as it went on. The acting was top-notch and the movie was executed wonderfully. However, the ending, which I will not divulge, had good aspects and bad. Still, the movie was so intriguing that it kept my interest the whole time. Some said that the movie was too long but I disagree. The two hours and fifteen minutes flew by. You should definitely see this movie which is one of the best of the year."
" Not Today, Double Fantasy
",,"Greetings again from the darkness. Comparisons with ""The Illusionist"" will abound as both are 19th century pieces centering on England's fascination with magicians and illusionists during that period. Although the settings are similar, it is important to note that ""The Illusionist"" is at its core a love story, while ""The Prestige"" is the tale of dueling illusionists and their fierce, even deadly, competition to be known as the BEST.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are the competing masters of illusion and after an onstage accident caused by Bale causes the death of Jackman's true love, the quest for best takes off on tangents that few could predict. To help confuse the issue, another master of illusion directs the film! Christopher Nolan brings his warped ""Memento"" twists and turns to us so that we, as viewers, are left floundering at what the next trick will be.The cast includes Michael Caine in a pretty strong role and Scarlett Johansson, who is given little to do other than squeeze into an assistant's costume and wear gobs of lipstick. There are nice turns from Piper Perabo (""Coyote Ugly""), Andy Serkis (""LOTR"", ""King Kong"") and David Bowie (yes, THAT David Bowie) as world renowned scientist Tesla, who himself is in a competition with Thomas Edison.Although many of the plots twists are pretty easy to see coming, it is nonetheless a joyous ride for those of us who enjoy a wild screenplay. And it must be noted that Bale is just outstanding as his brooding and near mystical presence adds a great deal to the film. So chalk up another victory for Mr. Nolan, and please don't give away any of the fun to those who have not seen the film."
" Dud!
",,"Yes, I was pretty excited to go and see The Prestige. Supposedly brilliant twists and an ingenious puzzle...directed by the man who brought us Memento. Well, all the pieces of the puzzle were laid out quickly to the audience and not to far in the two main twists presented themselves too. After that clues were forced down our throats until I started to believe there had to be a third, more brilliant twist to the story. It never presented itself though. Shame on you Mr. Nolan! The acting is pretty good, the film looks good, but I still felt robbed at the end. Do go see it though if you usually aren't able to predict the twist. It will leave you feeling really smart."
" An illusion of a magic thriller.
",,"The Prestige begins as does The Illusionist (2006): Magic tricks in the 19th century that astound the audience in the film and in front of it. The difference is that Prestige offers the secrets of many tricks where Illusionist bares few if any. Perhaps that difference reveals a figurative distance between the similar films: Prestige keeps an emotional distance, as do its characters, while Illusionist is very much about love between a man and a woman with the illusions serving that love. Indeed, ""prestige"" from the Middle French means illusion and tricks.The Prestige tells of Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), rivals for a lifetime. Their intense competition centers around being the best magician in London, a feat mostly connected with Borden's electromagnetic transporting a man in a split second to somewhere else. Angier wants the secret, and that's no secret in the film, nor that both men share the affection of Angier's assistant, played by the increasingly curvaceous Scarlett Johansson.The convolutions of plot are no surprise coming from Christopher Nolan of Memento fame. The downside is that the plot becomes repetitious, especially as it circles the doppelganger motif. Truth and illusion are served well, many times over, until redundancy and boredom set in, certainly for this reviewer who usually loves ambiguity and paradox.A ""prestige"" is the final stage of a trick, the one that brings back whatever had vanished and asserts the magician's preeminence. This film did not bring back for me the terror of the trick as Illusionist did. The trick is probably that Prestige looks like The Illusionist but is an illusion of just such a magic thriller."
" Suspend disbelief my ass!!!!!!!!
",spoiler,"I've heard of suspending disbelief but this is ridiculous. Tesla did not invent a teleportation machine. Creating this fantasy isn't a satisfying solution to how Jackman was able to do his teleportation act. ""The Prestige"" isn't the sort of movie where the motivations of the characters is enough to carry the plot, as it was in Amedeus. So much of the plot is sprinkled with revelations of magic tricks that I was expecting a rational explanation for Jackman's trick. I don't think anybody can claim this is irrelevant to the plot. Quite frankly the only thing about this story that held my interest was the possibility that the explanation for the trick would be clever. Instead it was just as disappointing as the time my parents told me there was no santa claus.""The Prestige"" was long, boring and the plot twists were trite."
" Best movie I've ever seen!
",,"I just came from seeing the movie and it is now by far my favorite movie of all time. I had hoped this movie would be as good as the trailer made it seem, and it DEFINITELY was. I really don't like all the mainstream crap that's stamped out like a cookie cutter, so this dark, intelligent, fun, and imaginative movie was great. And it really keeps you thinking--trying to figure out what you just saw after it's over. Great acting, time-period setting, and twisting plot too. Just a great all around movie. Can't think of anything else it reminds me of really. The confusing nature and multi-level plot and meaning reminds me a little of ""Lost Highway.""ONLY thing I didn't like was a couple birds dying."
" One of the best this year.
",spoiler,"The Prestige a Review by Lacy McKayThe newest Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) release is The Prestige, out today. It is an intricate story with delicate details that require the viewer's undivided attention.The Prestige details an intense rivalry of two turn-of-the-century magicians. This rivalry is ignited by Alfred Borden's (played by Christian Bale) accidental (or is it?) killing of Rupert Angier's (Hugh Jackman) magician's assistant wife. From the moment she dies, the two set out to out do each other in increasingly dangerous and awe-inspiring tricks. Their passions take them from London to Denver and back again. There are so many swaps in advantage that the viewer is almost challenged to figure out the next.Christopher Nolan does here what he does best: provides a chronologically disconjointed film with a story that almost instantly draws you into a world you are only vaguely familiar with. Also, as per Nolan's pattern, the story is never what it seems. The obsession of Angier turns dark and scary. His degeneration of his character is almost shocking.Casting here is very well done. Bale and Jackman are very convincing and draw us into their characters' dark, mysterious worlds where secrets and deception are not only important to their work, but essential to their beings. Scarlett Johanssen steps out of her recent, vampy roles to put on a convincing performance as both Bale's and Jackman's mistress/assistant. There are also great performances put on by a very strong supporting cast of Michael Caine (as the machinist behind Jackman's tricks), David Bowie (as a scientific mastermind, Tesla), and Andy Serkis (as Tesla's assistant).This is one of the top wide releases this year. Definitely a must see.9/10pace."
" To all the Haters and Skeptics out there
",,"This movie is Amazing! and to all of the people out there who say it ""didn't live up to the expectations."" Get a Life! If you expect a perfect movie, you are going to live your whole life being disappointed. Just accept a movie for being great. I gave this movie a ten, there are probably 20-30 movies i would give a ten. 10 doesn't mean that this movie is better than any movie out there, it just means it is great...as it was. Christan Bale and Hugh Jackman along with Sir Michael Cane all gave phenomenal performances, this movie had me and every one i have talked to at the edge of our seats the entire movie. So to all the movie fans out there Thanks for letting me blow off some steam, and go see the Prestige, it will leave you breathless."
" After a third viewing this film gets better and better
",spoiler,"Love this film despite all its conundrums.It has been postulated that in the Prestige (the third part of any magic ""trick""): the trick is right in front of us, but it is not easy to spot. It is established that when Angier uses the Box, the double is produced practically instantaneously. The scene where Borden rages about how quickly Angier (which we know to be the double) appears on the balcony underlines that the film-maker wants the viewers to know it (at least, if we are paying attention). Why, then, (and this is the fundamental point) does the double fail to appear on the night that Borden barges backstage?It has been suggested there are two explanations. First, it has been suggested that the copy hears Borden as he hacks at the tank containing the original Angier. Yet we are shown several seconds of silence, at the end of which we hear Borden shouting from underneath the stage. If the Angier copy simply hears Borden, then we need to explain why he didn't appear within a second as in every other performance. An alternative explanation is that Angier allowed Borden to sabotage the show, in order to see him jailed. But the same problem applies: either Angier and his latest clone are telepathic, or they knew he was coming in advance. And neither of these possibilities is suggested in the movie, nor, for that matter, the original novel. Nevertheless, Angier's clone does survive; in fact, the narrative relies upon it.Although the person postulating this says this makes no sense it is clear the first theory is incorrect whilst the second is obvious but it is not the clone that survives but the real AngierI shall be watching this again"
" Seen a dozen times but the same pleasure every time
",,"A movie that keep you in it from the start to the end. The first thing I thought of at the end of the movie was to ask myself when I was going to be able to watch it again. A good intrigue that keeps on going in which you really try to understand what is going on. A good acting game that makes it all fabulous. In addition, we learn a lot about magic and how a magic trick is organized so that it is successful. This is just one of my favorite movies, if you have not seen it, do not wait anymore!"
" A first rate movie! The Prestige is a timeless treasure! Will be enjoyed forever!
",,"Just in case the reader of this review has not watched this movie somehow. I've included no spoilers. I just watched The Prestige again now some 8 years later after its original release with some friends. Even though I still remembered a bit of what to expect in this twisting, turning show. Was still blown away by this first rate movie! My friends who were privileged in it being there first viewing. Had an even more high tend experience as the credits rolled. Yet because its such a well done show. In its direction of story, screen play, and acting. It all comes together to make a timeless treasure! A movie your going to enjoy again and again. Its movie magic and will entertain people forever! Don't miss out on this movie. This is why movies are made."
" Are You Watching Closely?
",,"It's Interstellar week so my quest to go back and review all of Christopher Nolan's previous films continues.The Prestige is another one of Christopher Nolan's non-linear films that gets better after every time you watch it. It's one of the reasons his films make incredible amounts of money. They require you to go back to the theater and re-watch the film any number of times. I love everything about The Prestige. It has two of my favorite film characters of all time in Alfred Borden and Robert Angier. Both are incredibly deep characters that seek power and legacy. They are rival magicians who get caught up in besting the other and tend to lose people closest to them along the way.It's non-linear structure works to it's benefit by showing flashbacks and flash forwards of them reading each other's diary which has the many tricks each of them have used. As we find out more about each character, we find out that it's become a lot more personal between the two than we previously thought. Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale give terrific performances that have become a bit understated. But the men aren't the only ones who give great performances, as Scarlett Johansson and Rebecca Hall give incredibly powerful performances as well. Hall hadn't been in any big movie to this point so her ability to hold her own up against Bale and Jackman is unprecedented. Scarlett is as sexy as ever but also surprisingly effective as an assistant to both of them at various points in the film. It's another film that you don't really want to know a lot going in without being spoiled. All I can say is, you will be shocked enough to press play again once the credits roll.Nolan's work here (in only a few month shoot & production) is impeccable. He is quite simply one of the greatest storytellers we have today and has an incredible knack for interweaving multiple story lines and a complicated script into something extraordinary. He's also the best at ending a story. Every one of the endings to his films have been perfect and stayed true to his respected characters. I hope Interstellar gives us another memorable ending for the ages.+Bale & Jackman +Friendship that became a rivalry +Nolan's effective non-linear structure +Hall & Johansson's powerful performances +That ending though..10/10"
" Best Film of the Year
",,"Earlier tonight I went to the cinema with a few friends to see The Prestige. I had seen Casino Royale the day before and felt that was the best film I had seen this year by a long way. However this all changed when I saw The Prestige. Not only boasting a great cast that included Jackman, Bale, Johansson, Caine but also a fantastic director and an exceptional screenplay composed by Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. Without giving too much away all I can say about the story is I think it contains some of the best story telling I have ever seen on the big screen. The acting in the film is also of a great quality with probably Jackman's best performance and Christian Bale continuing from where he left of with Batman Begins.Simply this is the best film I have seen all year and one of the best I have ever seen. A must see."
" Obsession and the prestige
",,"The Magic I have found that many of my friends seem incapable of enjoying magic tricks. They have an overwhelming desire to guess how the trick is performed  if they succeed, the trick is essentially ruined as no element of mystery remains. If they should however fail, they feel frustrated and cheated. It seems that the only way to truly enjoy magicians is if you let them fool you. In the last fifteen years a genre of films closely following the pattern of the best magic tricks has begun to emerge  films that incorporate a shocking ""twist"" ending which often change the nature of everything that had gone on before. Arguably the best (and one of the first) was the excellent ""Usual Suspects"". The film's twist was largely unexpected (not just the nature of the surprise ending but also the fact that it even exists) and as consequence was an immense popular and critical success. After that, many films have taken up the strategy, with varying degrees of success. The trap that many of them fall into is that the twist ending overshadows everything else in the film. If the audiences know that a twist ending is coming they might overlook the film itself in trying to guess the ending. M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"" suffered from the disease. Despite being possibly the most intelligent dissection of superheroes ever committed to film, a disproportional amount of attention and criticism were directed against the relatively weak surprise in the end, largely due to unreasonable expectation of following up or even outdoing ""The Sixth Sense"".At least in one part of the reviews and responses, a similar response is shaping up for ""The Prestige"". This is deeply unjust. The film's point above all else is the characterisation of two obsessive characters: Angier and Borden, and that is accomplished brilliantly. And the ending might not that be that bad either.The RivalsAs others have stated the film revolves around the conflict of two magicians of the XIX century, which starts after the death of Angier's (Hugh Jackman) wife for which Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is partially responsible. From then on, the two engage in an escalating and destructive game, which largely revolves around the ""Transported Man""- a trick they both perform. This cat and mouse game leads to some extraordinarily tense scenes that Christopher Nolan directs to perfection. Because the film relies heavily on trickery and misdirection, we are never clear where the events will take us. Furthermore, since there are no clearly defined heroes and villains, the expectations of each character's fate are further confounded.The cast is phenomenal. First and foremost, Christian Bale gives an acting masterclass. His Alfred Borden is a deeply obsessed, cold and conflicted personality etched with remarkable clarity by Bale, especially considering the relatively constricting screenplay. His character is not inherently sympathetic but Bale is able to infuse it with enough charisma that he threatens to completely take over the viewers' sympathies. His scenes with Rebecca Hall (who plays Borden's wife) are especially effective  Bale is equally believable as a loving husband and a man too obsessed with his magic to care for his wife.Hugh Jackman does almost equally as well (although he can't quite match Bale's powerhouse performance). He has a more interesting role and a better-developed character arc. Angier starts off as a relatively positive figure, a light-hearted showman and a more obvious protagonist than the brooding Borden. The main plot of the film shows his growing obsession with Borden and his more increasing disregard for anything or anyone else. By the time the film pulls into the final third, his character has undergone a deep transformation into a much more sinister and unpleasant figure  an almost out and out villain. Jackman more or less pulls it off and only seems out of his depth in a few scenes opposite Michael Caine where he, and anyone else, are reduced to scenery as Caine gives a deeply human and above all effortless performance.The most curious of all however, is David Bowie. How he chooses to portray Nikola Tesla is inspired, fiercely original and unexpected. His Tesla functions perfectly in the context of the plot  Bowie giving him just the right tone so that the Tesla of the film can be reconciled with the Tesla of reality. In addition, Bowie's performance is sufficiently layered to leave an open door for a more satisfying interpretation of the ""surprise"" ending.The TwistThe film, by the time it ends, gives an explanation of how both versions of ""The Transported man"" are performed. Borden's version is the film's central mystery and some viewers may feel cheated because the solution is relatively easy to guess (personally I was completely fooled up until the very end  and as consequence was tremendously entertained).Angier's version is also clearly explained  and represents the films biggest weakness. The explanation offered is a major disappointment and it mars the tone of the film significantly. However, at second glance, there is another interpretation that the film seems curiously unwilling to completely deny. Apart from a single shot, which gives credence to the ""official"" explanation, the film chooses to be ambiguous. Every other scene that takes us behind the scenes of Angier's trick is either deliberately unclear or depicted in flashback. Considering how obsessive the Nolan brothers are about tying up loose ends, it is difficult to believe that the ""alternative"" explanation is accidental. As the film itself puts it: ""Once you explain the trick, you are nothing."" Is it possible they deliberately left it unexplained? After all, that's what a prestige is for."
" It Only Gets Better...
",,"All I will say, is that if you get to the ending and are disappointed, you've missed the the prestige of the movie itself.This is the most incredible case of pulling the wool over an audiences eyes I've ever experienced... If you don't know what I'm talking about, you don't get the movies crowing achievement... you've been deceived by the movie.A hint that doesn't spoiler: There isn't a single piece of science fiction in the movie... Rethink it.. The acting is absolutely superb, and there are moments of superior skill shown by both Bale and Jackman, especially once you have seen the movie and understand it's plot.It is a movie that will leave you gasping... If you get it"
" Magic movie
",spoiler,"Christopher Nolan is a director who seems preoccupied by the human mind and psychological troubles. Each of his dark, thriller type movies has focused on one such a thing, fear, insomnia, memory, stalking. As befits the subject matter, The Prestige is a slippery kind of film, full of disguise (the array of false beards used by the two central magicians is quite dazzling) twists and turns and revelations. Like his breakthrough masterpiece Memento, Nolan uses a non-linear time scheme to great effect in disguising where the plot is going and where it has come from. As in Memento, the time of the scene is shown through the character's physical scarrings (Leonard Shelby's facial scars here become Robert Angier's limp) that suggest an earlier mental scarring not yet revealed in the film. Drawing an obvious parallel with his own profession, performance is also a central theme of the film for Nolan. Hugh Jackman's Robert Angier (AKA The Great Danton) is a consummate performer, a showman who is able to pull in huge theatre crowds while rival Alfred Borden shies from the limelight and from dressing up his tricks and thus often finds himself playing to small rooms of people. Angier is driven by performance so much that even ""Robert Angier"" is as much of a persona as ""The Great Danton"". He needs the acclaim of his audience, this is what defines him as a character. Jackman's charisma as a leading man has never been in doubt since he strapped on the claws and sideburns of Wolverine and this charisma is perfectly used for his stage performances as Danton, expertly selling the tricks. Meanwhile, as the obsessive Angier, Jackman brings a great range from the pain and anger after the death of his wife to the dangerous obsession and desire to discover the secret to his rival's trick. Even despite the cruel and slightly mentally disturbed things that Angier does, Jackman maintains the audience's sympathy for the most part and this is to his great credit. In his second feature with Nolan, after the superb Batman Begins, Christian Bale delivers an equally impressive performance as Borden, an intense, brooding but brilliant man who is able to spot the secret to Angier's and others' tricks with ease while they cannot see his. Borden has a similarly obsessive dedication but it is to creating the perfect trick, he lives his life purely for this and not for the audience acclaim like Angier. This sets up an interesting dichotomy in the motivations of the character that is reflected in their later actions. Bale and Nolan do bring some lighter moments for the serious Borden in his happy relationship with his wife and child. Seeing Borden as a happy family man brings the sympathy back round to him. With such attention on the leads, the supporting cast have less to do. Scarlett Johansson's role does not extend far beyond looking amazing in the saucy magician's assistant costumes. Meanwhile, the presence of David Bowie as enigmatic electricity manipulator Tesla is more of a distraction than a strong piece of casting, despite Bowie's obvious cool factor. However, the venerable Michael Caine gives a great weight to the character of Cutter, Angier's mentor who creates the mechanics of his tricks and tries to persuade him from the path of obsession. Caine is the heart and soul of the film, its moral compass and it is another superb performance of warmth, dignity and regret that suggest the great man is only getting better with age. No film is quite perfect and one minor flaw comes with the fact that with performances this good, the script doesn't need to say some of the things that it does. Writing with his brother Jonathon again, as in Memento, Nolan here has a slight tendency to overuse voice-over through the device of the magicians reading each other's diaries. The diaries may be a strong literary device in the source novel but are less cinematic. With Jackman conveying so much emotion wordlessly simply in his below stage bows when he wishes to be above, in front of the audience, there is no need to have his diary tell us this is how he felt. However, in general, the Nolans construct a strong script that provides a good balance between the lead characters and has a great momentum towards its strange climax. The twist in this film is not one that completely pulls the rug out from under you, that nobody will see coming, as this is often quite a lazy way of ending a movie with no relation to what has come before. Instead, Nolan threads the film with subtle references to what is really happening so that the film rewards paying close attention. Like the best magic tricks, it is not the outcome that amazes, it is the execution of it and even if you guess what the outcome is to be, there are still a couple of surprises waiting for you. Visually, Nolan brings up a number of stylish, arresting images of duplication, repetition and duality and objects that seemed just visually interesting earlier in the film gain in significance as the film progresses. The opening shots of a huge number of top hats in a forest or the cages full of pairs of canaries are prime examples of this. They are at first just a nice image, later the objects gain a significance and finally, the symbolism of the image has implications for the themes of the movie. The Prestige is, simply, a true prestige picture. An expert piece of film-making on virtually every level. What is more, five films in, it confirms Brit Nolan's place as one of the finest directors of his generation."
" Hmm well it was excellent IMHO
",spoiler,"I was reading some of the reviews and this was certainly love it or hate kind of film. But there was review that made feel very sad. People, pay attention to what you are watching, one reviewer goes on and on about Borden's ""clone"" and we never saw Tesla make clone of him so this just didn't work for me. Borden didn't have clone he had a twin brother! Sheesh this person was not paying attention at all and many other negative reviews must not have been either because what I saw was an engrossing, deep and very dark portrayal of what anger and jealousy can drive people to do to each other. Bravo Christopher Nolan, I can not wait to see your next film!"
" The Prestige is Superb
",,"""The Prestige"" is a superb drama. It represents the struggle between two masterful magicians in London. Hugh Jackman gives a superior performance as the tall handsome Robert Angier. And Christian Bale plays Alfed Borden, the counterpoint in this exciting and slickly done cinema. Scarlett Johansson is the younger attractive blonde wife, Olivia Wenscombe, who assists in unraveling the competitive nature of the constant battle. One is particularly impressed with the cinematography and muted color that only enhances the enjoyment. The young daughter, Sarah Borden, gives an adequate child performance as the fulcrum of Christian Bale's plight. And last but not least is Michael Caine's portrayal of Cutter, the magic show manager who weaves this tale in a suspenseful fashion to the delight of the entire audience. It is a remarkable film that is likely to be a top contender this year."
" Don't miss this intelligent entertaining film!
",,"Christopher Nolan may be the best young director in Hollywood. ""The Prestige"" is not nearly as challenging as ""Memento"" but is more intelligent than the average fare. You don't need a PHD to get it. Nolan has now made enough films that we can begin psychoanalyzing him. He seems to be attracted to stories that include obsession, revenge and deceit (self and otherwise.) All of these elements are crucial to the plots of ""The Prestige"", ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins."" The ending is a bit ambiguous but this is the world of magic where nothing is apparent. It's hard to take sides in this film. There is ruthless conflict between Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale's characters but neither is completely the hero nor the villain. Some of the 'trick' plot devices are a little obvious but it does not spoil the film. It's a fairly visual film and much better than the standard muck so I recommend seeing it in the theater if possible."
" Even spoilers will be of no help!
",,"The movie, if to be described in a single word, is unbelievable, with the word taken in it's utmost literal sense. Christopher Nolan does his magic on the novel written by Christopher Priest in 1995, and brings it to life in a way no one could have accomplished. With his ability to use flashbacks and mixing the past with the present, Mr.Nolan makes those watching the movie, his audience. The Pledge is simple, two magicians; Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) are set to out-do one another. But it seems as if every step the movie takes is The Turn of the whole trick and you must ask yourself, are you watching closely?. The Prestige is where you will be left mesmerized and trying to connect the dots.At times, it may seem as if the movie is moving too fast or if it's too hard to grasp but believe me, when the final curtain is drawn, you will know everything."
" really good movie
",,"one of the few movies I've seen in the past few years that completely captivates the audience. people aren't reaching for their cellphones of kissing their date but instead are holding their breath waiting for the next word. i had almost forgotten what a truly good movie can do to a room of people. from the first line of the movie you will be memorized by the mystery of it all. the cast is flawless along with directing. the plot is cunningly so constructed in such a way that is gives great satisfaction to the viewer. if gives enough hints for the sharpest of eye and will spin you in a one-eighty once you think you have figured it out. the minute you think that this is just another easier suspense movie, think again and make sure ""you're watching closely."""
" Creative, intelligent, well-written and top-notch acting
",,"The movie follows two competing magicians through their careers, as they each try to upstage the other and as their rivalry escalates. In the fighting, they both loose things dear to them, and each loss is more brutal, right to the very end.The movie was very well written, well directed and the acting was top-notch. Christian Bale plays a magician who is extremely talented when it comes to magic, but not so much when it comes to showmanship. His rival, played by Hugh Jackman, easily surpasses him in that area and catches the eye of the crowd far better. Bale, upset at being the better magician but not seen as such grows bitter and wants what Jackman has.At the same time, Jackman envies what he sees in Bale - his talent, and his tricks and he becomes obsessed with trying to figure them out, namely his most impressive trick, the Transported Man. Jackman comes up with his own version of it, aided with a machine built by Mr. Tesla himself (played by David Bowie of all people, and with surprising accuracy).However, the trick isn't quite what it seems. Really, really, really not what it seems.As a matter of fact, neither is Bale's trick what it seems. Nor is his family life.It all builds up right to the end, with very well placed twists, and the last one the most shocking of all.It's good. Go see it. You'll like it."
" Superb!
",,"This movie is pure genius from the story to the directing to the acting. It entertained and bewildered me and finally crescendos into a PERFECT MASTERPIECE! This is one of my all-time favorites.I saw THE ILLUSIONIST which I also liked and even thought it was better half way through this one. But I was fooled. I have only received such a feeling after a movie finished when I saw The 6th Sense.I will see this movie at least 3 times.Your friend, Randy Vild"
" to envy or not to envy? to hate... or to hate bitterly?
",spoiler,"Seeing this movie filled me with wonder at the power of visual imagery! At the power of human emotions! Not a story about magic... but a story of rivalry, then envy... down the pathway to anger then hatred... to murder... and there are no heroes... no good men.Not about magic, this story revolves around opposing, forceful personalities which finally clash to ultimately destroy one another.This movie is not a feel-good type, but dark, brooding, and intense. It is cinematically and artistically beautiful and the time-period adds mysterious overtones yet never overwhelms.The two magicians are not magicians as much as they are opponents who hate one another and would do anything to destroy one another. It is a story of human weaknesses and madness. Nothing pretty about the outcome.The story is well-written, the actors & actresses are magnificent, and the whole thing is well-done.And we all need to be reminded that to hate this way is to invite into the soul that which steals your joy."
" Greatest movie of the year!
",,"This is probably the best movie I have seen all year. The plot was so secretive and suspenseful that it kept me guessing the whole time i was watching it. The ending was some what of a mystery, and i still am not quite sure of what exactly took place, but the directors and writers of this movie definitely deserve an award.The movie has two hidden morals, one that deals with the brutality of rivalry and one that deals with obsession. Obsession can sometimes lead to one's ultimate downfall. This theory is proved correct by the plot of this movie. Towards the beginning of the movie, I believed that Angier was the protagonist and that Borden was the 'bad guy', but assumptions aren't always what they seem.Other than it's complexities, I also thought that the movie helped the viewer gain some knowledge of the 'tricks behind the trick' having to do with magic. I'm not saying that what they portrayed as the secrets to some old magic tricks are real, but they kept me wondering ""what if..""If you are not easily confused and can keep up with a fast-paced mystery, then go watch this movie as soon as you can!!"
" Greatest Triumph of the Year
",,"One of the greatest movies i have ever seen! its a mind bending illusion, a well-performed marvel by one of the best up and coming directors, Christopher Nolan. Roll out the red carpet, because I'm thinking Oscars!! An amazing screenplay written by Jonathan Nolan keeps you on the edge of your seat, stumped and guessing until the end! Brilliant film-making and it keeps me pumped and ready for the next Nolan picture, The Dark Knight, which is a sequel to the also awesome Christopher Nolan movie, Batman Begins. Also written by Jonathan Nolan, it should be a great follow-up to this mind game of a movie by the newest elite director on the market."
" All expectations met
",,"When I discovered that many of the people involved in the making of this movie, both in front and behind the camera, were also involved in the making of one of my other favorites, ""Batman Begins,"" my expectations for this movie went immediately up, and I must say that I was not disappointed. The writing was excellent, the lines delivered perfectly, and the plot was so original, with so many twists, that it kept you on the edge of your seat the whole way through. The casting couldn't have been better.I think it was a bit confusing at first, as there are so many switches between flashbacks and present day that it sometimes becomes hard to keep up, but it's essentially all sorted out by the time you've really gotten into it. All the same, I cannot wait to see it a second time, when I'll undoubtedly get even more out of the plot than the first time through. Some people also claimed that they had the whole plot figured out from the very beginning, and I guess I feel rather sorry for them, though I myself was kept guessing throughout the whole thing. On the other hand, I believe that there will be many who do not like ""The Prestige"" because it actually requires you to think. (*gasp*) This movie has the same, dark flavor as ""Batman Begins,"" though with slightly less action, and is one of my new favorite movies. I anxiously await watching it a second time, and reading the book.On a final note, do not listen to those who say that this movie was terrible because of the numerous ""plot holes."" Anyone who completely understands each aspect of the plot will see plainly that such holes do not exist, and that those who say otherwise are under a false impression, confused, or just missed something. If you can follow along, there is nothing seriously wrong with this movie. I'd recommend it to anyone."
" One of the Smartest Films Recently
",,"The Prestige is a film founded upon wit and intellectual conflicts. The Nolans don't want to challenge the audience as much as they just want the audience to know how brilliant they are. And they are! The Prestige is spectacularly brilliant and full of terrific surprises and excellent twists. For any moviegoer who gets a great kick out of a battle of wits, a game of revenge, and an all-around sneaky plot full of schemes and cons and tricks, The Prestige is the movie of the year for you.The cast is very convincing, especially the two leads and Caine, who after half a century in movies will never become too weather-beaten to pack a punch, enjoying the tricks they play on us as much as Christopher and Jonathan Nolan are. The Nolans, though they love to show off a bit, in this case by tacking one too many surprises, they are not yet on the road to self- indulgence like many of today's most impressive auteurs like Shyamalan for instance. They will no doubt be knocked by a few critics by Christopher's use of elaborate, multi-layered nonlinear plot structure, telling two flashbacks at the same time while driving the story with the present day. Following, Memento, and even Batman Begins have flaunted the nonlinear technique to the point where, like Tarantino, they will be accused of using it as a gimmick. However, this technique comes in very handy in building the tension in the story. The film is somehow able to surprise the audience after its already shown us the outcome of something.Once again, it spills a little overboard with its twists and turns once it's satisfied the audience with a dazzlingly brilliant climax, but overall, the film is brilliant and weaves one of the finest suspense threads in awhile."
" i need sum 'splaining
",spoiler,"I thought this movie was absolutely awesome. It was original, casting was perfect,(although I'm still not a huge Scarlett Johansen fan) Bale and Jackman should be up for Oscars if not already. Is this even comparable to the Illusionist?, i never saw it. If you liked either Memento or Batman Begins you'll probably love this movie. Im really excited about the sequel to Batman Begins. Im a little confused though. At the very end it shows Jackman's character in the water tank. Is that a duplicate he made, is it the original, is he still alive??? Somebody help, i feel stupid. Also, does anybody know the historical significance of the Thomas Edison references? I think it was Edison, maybe Jefferson?"
" Nolan delivers more than just smoke and mirrors
",,"It's now official in my book; Christopher Nolan is the Hitchcock of the twenty-first century. His films are often dark, psychological and mysterious and always intelligent and carefully planned out; he's a real pro of both direction and misdirection. From his early film, Following, to last summer's blockbuster hit, Batman Begins, his films also usually require some intelligence and maybe even a second viewing to put all the jig-saw piece together. His latest thriller, entitled The Prestige, is a combination of the gloomy cinematography of Batman Begins and the swift and often disorienting editing of Following. Yes, it's a thinker, and yes I'm sure some will easily confuse this film with The Illusionist, but these two films couldn't be anymore different. Where as The Illusionist was a romantic-mystery set in Vienna, The Prestige is a dark mystery-thriller set in Victorian era London. This is a darker, meaner and a much more emotionally colder film about two men's obsession with fame and greatness, and to what lengths they will desperately go to get it.The Prestige is about two magicians, Rupert Angier and Alfred Bowden, played marvelously by the charismatic Hugh Jackman and the slick and crafty Christian Bale. Angier is a magician with a real talent for wooing the audience with his razzle-dazzle tricks, and Bowden is the more talented of the two, but doesn't quite know how to engage the audience with his show stopping talents. They were once partners working with a magic stage producer named Cutter (played by the great Michael Caine), but when Angier's wife is accidentally killed in a magic trick gone wrong a strong rival and bitter hatred is born. Angier holds Alfred personally responsible for the accident, and then sets out to get his revenge by up-staging his competition with more dazzling tricks or simply just steal the ones he's already using, but just adding a little more pizazz to win over the crowds and ultimately get all the glory.The rival gets more and more heated when Alfred pulls off an incredible trick that Angier just can't seem to figure out how to duplicate. To the best of his knowledge he tries to replicate the trick, but as he struggles to unravel the mystery behind it meets an obsessed scientist named Nikola Telsa (played very well by David Bowie, that's right David Bowie, how awesome was that!), who's experimenting with electricity. Remember this is the late nineteenth century, and to some that probably was a form of magic back then. As this rivalry gets more and more intense lives are shattered (along with limbs) and friendships are betrayed. The film bounces back and forth from the present time and the past (with the use of 0f flashbacks), which helps to keep the mystery masked until it's ready to be unveiled at the end. But unlike The Illusionist, this isn't a film that's solely a one-trick pony. The Prestige is twisting and turning from beginning to end, and never stops. Some things you might see coming, others you might not, but regardless, Nolan delivers the drama and the suspense to pull you into the film and carry you through it. I won't talk anymore about the film or its secrets; it's far too much fun to discover them for yourself and then talk to others who have seen it afterwards. I noticed a number of people in the theater stayed in their seats until the end credits discussing the film's ending and it's many surprises.The reason I'm not giving this film a perfect ten is because sometimes it can get a bit too confusing, but I'm sure it'll make it even more fun to go back and watch it over and over again just like Memento. Also, emotionally it was a little tough to get into fully. The characters aren't quite fully black nor white; they're a shade of gray that's constantly drifting from the light to the dark. Jackman is especially impressive because of his charismatic charm (remember how likable Wolverine was? Yeah, me too.) and to see him slip into evil is actually kind of spooky. And what can I say about Christian Bale other than the fact that he's an amazing actor. If anyone is to be the ""hero"" of this tale I'd probably put my money on him. With The Prestige Christopher Nolan has given me one more reason why he's one of my favorite film directors working today, and so far his track record is flawless and his films are consistently intriguing and refreshingly original. This film is one of the smartest brain teasers of the year and I am certain The Prestige will make my top ten favorite movies of the year list. Now I can't wait for Nolan and his team to get to work on the sequel to Batman Begins; The Dark Knight. I'm sure that once again I'll be left stunned and thrilled."
" Plot Twists ad infinitum
",,"The word ""discombobulated"" comes to mind. I missed a lot of the dialog either thru deafness or the English dialects (or both); there were one (or more) too many flashbacks; but more importantly there were so many plot twists, I suspect that if there are any holes in the plot (which wouldn't surprise me) no one would be able to detect them unless they had a copy of the film and jotted down each fact (or illusion) as it transpires. No fair checking Christopher Priest's novel or the Nolan brother's(?) screenplay. At the end of the film, you ought to at least know how many Borden's and how many Angier's there were (are). And how many died (if any). If someone produces a film with more plot twists than ""Prestige"", will that make it a better film? Overkill! No thank you."
" an insult to the intellect
",spoiler,"Great sets, good actors, a reasonable story, but spoiled by Hollywood once again low-balling the viewers IQ.To resolve the competition between two magicians, the story introduces a scientist who creates for one of the magicians a device capable of duplicating whatever is put into it.Having acquired this duplicating device, the magician then uses it to create copies of himself, which he drowns as part of his magic act. This act of repeated self-murder allows him to successfully compete with his rival, although we only discover the mechanism behind the successful magic act at the very end of the film.Surely the act of creating a copy of yourself only to ask him to commit suicide as a means of furthering ones competitive goals deserves a better treatment than that given in this film.There's a story here far more interesting than the one presented."
" plot is not clear and is quite muddled; good film making
",spoiler,"I am a magician. The show is entertaining in magic but not realistic. The big stuff (2 tricks) are well known. The Tesla transported man (and hat and cat) are not real and we are not expected to think so but just to enjoy disbelief. The plot had a real plot but it attempts to add to many veggies to the soup so that we do not know if what we see is true or could never happen. If so, you could write anything into any story and tell the viewer just to try and figure it out. That what happens here, doubles, science that couldn't happen, women that are important and have no importance to the men. But magnificent Michael Caine is Oscar material. I enjoyed the show but it is not really good. Actors are fine but are really wasted but I guess they got paid."
" Bad in every way.
",,"The film starts with ridiculous rumbling noises drowning the natural sounds, in a pathetic attempt to create atmosphere. It then proceeds with actors mumbling their lines so it is hard to tell what is going on.Then we have a rapid series of flashbacks, which are sprung on us suddenly, and sometimes it is not immediately apparent that we are watching a flashback or merely a change of scene. As a result of all this it is very hard to follow the plot, and it is not helped by the fact that two of the main actors are very similar in appearance.At the end, we discover that it is a Science Fiction film!I find it hard to see why so many people rated it so highly, it is badly acted, confusing, and I did not find it entertaining."
" the prestige has no prestige
",,"A film that you know the end from the beginning must be a very good film to catch the attention of the audience, like a good trick of magic or like good films like ""memento"" or ""usual suspects"". If we know the end at least we expect some interesting history, a real plot, good characters, not just a pretentious film. Here we only have two magicians going all the way around each other, with an obvious twist that evolves into a sci-fi twist which nobody wants to see because we already know. I'd say that the acting of the three main characters is very good (Bale is superb as always, and Jackman is improving), s. Johanson is also OK but her character could be off the film and nobody would notice."
" Disapponting
",,"If this were some re-make or slasher I would expect nothing . It is an original idea with a fine cast and wonderful sets and settings .Maybe the idea is too original ( maybe not ) . I don't want to give much away . I should have loved this movie ; I love magic ; Hugh Jackman is very David Copperfieldish (look and everything) this is a good thing to me ; I love Michael Caine his accomplishments are too numerous to even begin to mention except to say see the original ""Italian Job"" . This does have some interesting historical tidbits which may spark interest . There is I believe a moral to the story which may in the end be a redeeming characteristic ; but it is disjointed and feels that way . I could not recommend people spend their time or money on it ."
" A shallow cinematic confidence trick
",spoiler,"Having established his reputation with the tricksy, but effective thriller Memento, director Christopher Nolan and his screenwriter brother, Jonathan, return to the ""nothing is what it seems"" school of movie-making with their latest film, The Prestige. Unfortunately, this time the result can only be classed as a fraud.Focussing on Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), a pair of duelling Edwardian era magicians; for most of its overlong duration, The Prestige maintains the pretence that it is grounded in recognisable reality. Indeed at least one of the characters, the pioneering inventor Tesla (creepily played by David Bowie in one of the film's few highlights), was actually a real historical figure. Although the drama is steeped in illusion and trickery, the film lures its audience into thinking that all they are seeing is mere sleight of hand; tricks of the conjurer's trade, many of which are revealed in some detail.Yet when it comes to explaining the final baffling illusion, the Nolan brothers suddenly reveal the whole movie to be one big confidence trick. There is no ingenious explanation for Angier's climactic spectacle. It is in fact impossible; a cheat relying on an absurd sci-fi wheeze that renders the whole story completely meaningless.When Angier discovers all the cats and top hats out in the woods, my first thought was that Tesla was trying to con him into thinking he was being sold a cloning device, since obviously for it to be a REAL cloning device would just be too preposterous. But no, apparently not.Compounding the risible plot denouement, the film's dramatic and romantic elements also fail to engage. The love stories are underdeveloped, and end up hopelessly mangled by the disjointed, hop around all over the place, narrative structure. Only Rebecca Hall emerges well from these romantic subplots, managing to produce a convincing performance from the underwritten role of Borden's wife, Sarah. In contrast Scarlett Johansson just looks bored, as the glamorous assistant, Olivia. She appears to have faxed in her performance from the Hollywood hills. Her accent is a mess, and she seems to be relying upon her, admittedly ample, cleavage to do most of the acting.About all that pulls The Prestige up from a one or two star rating to a four, is impressive cinematography, and some excellent set designs and period detailing. Won't be enough to get me to watch it again, though."
" Confusingly told story of two disagreeable rivals.
",spoiler,"Although the story is great, and the end-twist, i.e, no magic at all, is fabulous, the Prestige gets lost in the confusing manner in which it is told (exactly just like Memento; I do not understand that the same director who after all those unsuccessful attempts gave the Batman series a worthy movie, gets lost for the second time in his own story-telling).The many flashbacks, different views, diaries and all, lead to a sort of loss of sense for which you either have to watch the movie all over to check whether you got it right and whether the director has made any mistakes, or you just settle with what you have grasped the first time- a somewhat messy account of - to tell you the truth- uninteresting events.The feud between the two magicians is, frankly speaking, quite flat. Both are so annoying and dislikable, that you can't help but think that it would be in the general interest of mankind if both would perish. I am usually not this cruel, bit I certainly could not identify or sympathize with either.The good things include the somewhat dark perspective (the part with David Bowie and his experiments really can get you some goose bumps if you are inclined to get some), and the end with all those clones dead is quite eerie as well. So the feeling had it going. The character of Scarlett Johansson had much unnecessary screening time.The Prestige is really entertaining, but I am generally opposed to films and plots that are supposed to have ""meaning"" and something to say, but are nothing but an optical illusion themselves. This is clearly the case with the Prestige- one admirable and great idea (that of the no-tricks) is exploited to its uttermost, all marrow sucked out of its bones. The rest is illusion."
" such potential
",spoiler,"My spoiler will come at the end. As stated this was a gorgeous movie, the period details and shots were lovely, worth at least 9/10 stars. The acting was high caliber and The Prestige (unlike the Illusionist) took some time with the magic and its procedure and performance (the technology and the showmanship, I love them both about ""magic""), which was what I looked forward to in each movie. The plot of competition, obsession and sacrifice was above average, which is more than I expected, so I was set to love it all. But because I loved it one of the twists (a single, ridiculous twist!) ruined the whole plot. The spoiler:The Prestige spends quite a bit of time explaining or teaching the science and technology behind the magic, and it dares to use a Victorian electric replicating machine! I would have preferred actual magic to fake science. Even fake science would have been fine, a vacuum tube or something, but truly fantastic science?! Star Trek could get away with it because it was set hundreds of years in the future, who knows what will happen, who cares, it's entertainment. This was just so wrong it stayed on my mind and ruined the finale. It's still bothering me today, and I've waited to be objective before I voted and commented."
" Dueling magicians. Secret obsessions.
",spoiler,"I personally don't agree that THE PRESTIGE will be one of the best films you have the chance to see. Visuals are stunning and you can tell that the director Christopher Nolan put a lot of labor into this project. Set at the turn-of-the-century London, magicians are celebrities and idols of the day. Two magicians, that have turned enemies deluxe, will passionately not stop at nothing to learn each other's majestic secrets. Each magician will apply deceit, sabotage and other dastardly deeds to become the greatest magician of all time. This movie is overly long and at times seems like it is just plodding along. Stars include: Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Piper Perabo, David Bowie and Christian Bale."
" I guess I expected too much
",,"I loved the actors in this move. I also love the director. I was, unfortunately, tainted I fear by my viewing of THE ILLUSIONIST, which was a clearly a better film in my opinion. I mention THE ILLUSIONIST for only two reason, reasons that caused me to like THE ILLUSIONIST and made me disappointed in THE PRESTIGE. First least significant was the magic performed: I was far more entertained by the former movie's magic tricks than the latter, which were explained and therefore less magical--even the ""scientific"" tricks, which I will not spoil here. Second and far more important, was the level of intelligence in the plot and the writing of the film. THE PRESTIGE suffered, in my opinion, from twists that become illogical, right to the very end which was obvious to me from the middle of the film. Meanwhile, THE ILLUSIONIST, which again I admit tainted my experience by raising the proverbial bar and challenging THE PRESTIGE, brilliantly revealed incredibly intricate plot motivations and actions that we only figure out at the very ending of the film--though I suspect many viewers will not put all the pieces of THE ILLUSIONIST together even after being handed the details by film's end. In short, THE PRESTIGE was an enjoyable film for high school students and for people who want to see a movie by will not think about what is happening. THE ILLUSIONIST is for college graduates who actually earned their degree. I realize this sounds very snobbish, for which I am sorry. But I am trying to be honest."
" does not deserve to be on top 250
",,"enjoyable-yes, predictable-no Christopher Nolan's newest film has elements of suspense and surprise that will shock and throw you off guard but we've come to expect that from him. This film is no masterpiece such as Nolan's ""Memento"" but has many enjoyable qualities. The acting is for the most part superb with great performances by Michael Caine, Jackman, Bale and most surprisingly David Bowie as the mysterious ""Tesla"". Though this may be an enjoyable movie it sure as hell does not deserve to be on the top 250. Only due to ""fanboys"" of Nolan did this movie make the top 250 and that is pitiful. People should not rate a movie because they are infatuated by the director or his earlier work. In all, an enjoyable movie but IT SHOULDN'T BE ON THE SAME LIST AS ""THE GODFATHER"" OR EVEN ""MEMENTO""!!!"
" This is the first movie I saw twice in three days. Loved it!
",,"The Prestige is seriously the best movie I've ever seen! Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, and Rebecca Hall did GREAT acting, however, Christian Bale should win BEST ACTOR! I've enjoyed his performances in previous films like American Psycho and The Machinist, but he deserves special recognition for his role in this movie. If you don't see this film,you are missing out on a great story, with great actors, and an awesome directing job by Christopher Nolan. I was pleasantly surprised to see David Bowie and Andy Serkis in the film and they played their roles PERFECTLY. Michael Cain adds a great deal to the stability and credibility to the main characters and as always does a fine job acting. This is certainly a MUST SEE!"
" Absolutely fantastic
",spoiler,"Everything I had hoped for and more. Not a letdown in any sense. Everything about this film was pretty much perfect for me. Great acting, cool magic tricks, fantastic production design, and an excellent plot. I was completely enthralled and involved for the entire movie, and - even though I guessed it before hand - the twist was quite well-executed. The layered narrative worked quite well for me, especially since it contributes to the plot twists, and I never felt confused at all. I loved that it was as much horror as fantasy or drama. The final shot was perfectly creepy. The only downside - and this is truly nitpicking - was Scarlett Johansson, who was underused and never really delivered. Still, it didn't really matter, because this is a fantastic film. Can't wait to see it again."
" A great story, but not a great movie
",,"As I sat in the theater, engrossed in the kind of story I love  complex, intriguing, and mysterious, I wondered why I wasn't enjoying it more. I found myself trying harder to tie the action on the screen to Nikola Tesla's real work than to tie together the many seemingly loose ends of the story.It was a good movie, no doubt, but it seemed a shame not to do more with a story that had so much potential. The problem, I finally realized, was this: there were a number of key events: dramatic, exciting, and violent events that were underplayed to the point of being almost lost in the background. After lingering over a rather dull conversation, the cameras would speed past an amazing and startling event, leaving me to visualize the event in my head long after the camera had gone on to another long conversation. Furthermore, I found it impossible to gain any rapport with any of the main characters other than Cutter, played superbly by Michael Caine, which prevented me from investing myself in any hoped-for outcome. Eventually, the movie just seemed too long. Perhaps, the reason for the rather strange approach, emphasizing words over actions, was that the clues are in the events, not the words, and the filmmakers wanted to promote the film as a suspenseful story full of twists and turns  a movie that would challenge the audience. The problem is that there is nothing really very challenging about the movie. Anyone who follows the events will understand what is going on.Considering the dearth of quality in the Hollywood product, ""The Prestige"" is definitely worth going to see, especially for anyone who is interested in the art of illusion. But, a story this good should provide a lot more."
" Saw it coming a mile away
",,"This comment is only based on the plot. I will leave the judgment of directing and cinematography and editing and score to you. However, if you are expecting a twist at the end, it is extremely weak, and guess what, you have already figured it out halfway throughout the movie. I will not tell you any spoilers, but be warned it was disappointing. If you are like me, you have probably seen the previews for this movie (and you liked the preview, I mean, why not? there are three good actors and an attractive female, and the movie is about performing magic? what is there not to like?) and you may have seen the Illusionist, which you may have liked and thus you are ready to see this mega movie, right? Even tough you will most likely NOT feel that this was a waste of money and or time, you will most likely be very disappointed. The reason is plain. The movie is unrevealing itself, however you already know that...so you wait to see the next unrevealing but you know that..so you wait to see the next unrevealing again, but there isn't. Disappointing and not worthy of thumbs up (as they say). I gave it a 7 because, well it is still a movie well done (except for the plot).sadly disappointed."
" AWESOME movie! Worth a very close look!

Christopher Nolan's film ""The Prestige"" is a modern masterpiece.I'm not going to give away one single thing about the plot (I know I know, I'm evil...), but I will give all the kudos in the world to the talented Mr. Nolan and his amazing cast.And let's face it, ladies - when a movie has two of filmdom's sexiest actors in it (Hugh Jackman & Christian Bale)... well, need I say more? :) So do yourself a favor and check out ""The Prestige"" - it's true magic!

" Christopher Nolan's Crowning Achievement
",spoiler,"I've just watched ""The Prestige"" and, without a shadow of a doubt, this is Christopher Nolan's shining moment. Not since Memento (another fine Nolan film) have I seen such a well-crafted story told in such a creative way that keeps you on the edge of your seat, wondering what turn the movie will take next! I've never been a fan of spoilers, so let's just say that you have to keep watching until the very end - and the film's ending is a testament to what can be done with a great script, excellent acting and top-notch directing. The film gives one the distinct feeling that the life of an illusionist is not one to be taken lightly. See this film! Trust me - you won't be disappointed! 9 out of 10!"

The dynamic framework and Victorian setting pull you in from the real world and take you on thrilling experience. Acting as it was meant to be, you will feel the dramatics as if you were at a theatre play and experience the great affects of film. A haunting dark force surrounds many parts and after you leave the theater the film will stay with you. Don't blink."
" Watch Closely!
",,"The Prestige brings the magic to the screen. It's not in the tricks that make you scratch your head but rather the plot and twists. Christopher Nolan has directed yet again another movie worth the price of admission. Many say that it is too long, but (like every perfectionist) Nolan takes about half an hour just to set up. Nolan places his signature on the film as it starts out ahead of the story and goes back. Few could pull off this film due to the confusion of the story's twists and how to reveal them coherently to the viewer while giving off an exciting energy. The costumes were great and really made it feel Victorian. The one downside that critics had were that the characters were flat, but I think that it was quite realistic when all the twists are set out and you look into each character and their reactions. Overall a movie that felt genuinely well made and fulfilled its potential."
" Be Ready For A Moral Wild Ride
",spoiler,"The duplication of ones self and repetitive murder/suicide is the ultimate ending to this movie. The ultimate ""MAN BEHIND THE MASK"". Just fantastic and utterly sickening. I walked out of this movie feeling excited that it was all laid out at the end (however mildly predictable), but as it all set in the INSANITY of Hugh Jackmans character was well acted and well portrayed.The entire movie I was GIDDY that Bales character was gonna hang because I felt he was the ultimate bad guy. But then with all the cards laid out, Jackman is insane.The acting was well done (Caine is my demi god) and Scarlette is beautiful and well acted per the norm.Over all I LOVED this movie :)"
" I thought it was excellent.
",,"I thought it was excellent. You know those movies, where the previews are amazing, and then the movie sucks? This wasn't one of them. I wasn't disappointed in any aspect. For some reason I always compare movies to their trailers, because the trailers always make the movie look so amazing, and mysterious, and suspense filled, and usually the previews are better than the movies. This movie was...well..I'll just say I wasn't disappointed AT ALL, like I usually am when I go to the movies.It was very intense, especially when things were revealed near the end. So much so that some people in the theatre could barely stay in their seats. I've never seen people so wrapped up in a movie until last night.The story was great. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine were all great, and I didn't find any of the acting to be wooden. The cinematography was wonderful, the camera work was wonderful. I was slightly confused at some points, (the movie also takes place in several layers of time) and there are a lot of questions that aren't answered until the end of the movie, unless you're a good problem solver. Most of the people I was with were able to solve some things.I'm taking a film course this year, and our teacher is making us write a review for ""Lone Star."" Well...I didn't like that movie to begin with, but now I wish more than ever that we could have chosen our own films, because I would definitely have more positive and insightful things to say about ""The Prestige."" To sum things up, I thought this movie was excellent, and definitely worth the $10 dollars go get in. I may see it again before it's out of theatres."
" Worth the Wait
",,"Like the reviewer before me, I've been ready and waiting for this film from the moment I heard about it. The stars, all favorites of mine. The director, amazing. And the cherry on top--Bowie. Unlike my fellow reviewer, I was astounded and satisfied. Performances were top-notch all around, direction was masterful, and the script! Can we talk about the intricate, subtle, mind-bending way the story was constructed? Yes, it is a little on the challenging side, and that's what makes it great. Anything less would have been boring and predictable. But the writing here kept me guessing and led me in directions I sometimes wasn't prepared for. Like Memento, that other masterstroke from the brothers Nolan, the story lines intertwine in time, which always keeps the viewer wondering how the characters got to where (you think) you know they're going.And then there was Bowie. He's been woefully absent from the big screen for too long, and this role was built for him. Seriously one of the best entrance scenes ever, and one only Bowie could pull off. Bale, as always, blows me away with his ability to fully inhabit his character. Jackman impresses again, though I don't know that I am surprised, since he has proved his talent time and again. Caine is an institution unto himself. Rebecca Hall rises beautifully to the task bringing the tortured wife(?) to life. And Johansson--amazing. She is learning more with every role and I can only look forward to a long and interesting career.Run, don't walk to this one. And don't blink while you're there."
" Trash
",,"After less than an hour I turned off this trash as could not fathom what was going on in the story.It starts with a Dicken's era magician's act apparently going wrong and someone to blame and then a confusing and muddled plot which is dreary, fake and boring with equally mixed up flash backs etc.All the characters are unpleasant and not likable in this film and speak with accents sounding like present day cockney.The whole movie is unconvincing, silly and hence worthy only of the lowest mark possible.What a load of rubbish: 1/10"
" Almost.
",,A movie with incredible twists that is founded in reality but loses itself in fantasy.
" Underrated why? (Watch it twice)
",,"I think that people just don't understand the movie or it's just my perspective? I'll start off by being honest that their motives were a bit extreme but it made sense, and toward the end it was getting predictable, but that is because Nolan wanted you to think about the importance to one character that had one line. There are so many parallels in this movie, it depends on the viewer. Who doesn't love a questionable ending? I sure due, not only is the last scene questionable, the final minutes of it is, and of course there's some explanation. This is a movie you'd want to watch twice, have to watch twice.
I only gave it a 9/10 instead of a 10/10 because of their motives, it doesn't feel like a time during the 1800s, and others I can't think of right now."
" A delight to watch!!!!!!
",,From start to end it keeps the viewer in confusion. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale acted fantastic.
" ""Are you watching closely""
",,"Christopher Nolan is a master!!To those who say that this film give away everything this film stands for and makes us think that we are stupid...that's what it's all about! This film is about magicians and just what magicians want to achieve, is to make their audience think they are stupid... because they do not see certain things in the trick, which are logical. However, it is pushed under their noses. And this is exactly what this film does. Just like a magic show, this film contains one twist/surprise after another. A great achievement from Nolan and cast & crew.What I love in Nolan's movies, is when he plays with time. In almost all his films, he forms the ""normal"" story structure to a complex whole. And every time he surprises me again.The only minus is the fact that, during Alfred's shows, Alfred's assistant always picks Angie out of the crowd and vice versa. In most of Angie's shows, Alfred was taken out of the crowd to check the objects on the scene. This was not realistic.But... to all who want to be amazed and immersed in the world of magic, watch this masterpiece!!"
" Pretty paper
",,While the symbolic adventures conclude only rationing of thought as processed and not lost in the longing of before time. The prestige is a great learning tool of the necesssity to communicate process as the thoughtless inclination to produce growth.
" So good
",,"The forgotten Nolan film. Buried amongst his other great works such as the Dark Knight trilogy, this is one of his best! I'm a big magician fan so this film really nailed it."
" best movie, ever!
",,"Watching again and again, CBale and HJ together inc."
" don't know the winner
",,It's in my top ten film because you found the winner in last scene
" Nolan it his best!
",,"Since the first time I watched Batman Begins I have been a great admirer of Nolan and his work. The way he works with time in his movies is something very special. I had heard a lot of good things about The Prestige, but I never took the time to watch it. Oh why oh why didn't I do that?! It was a BIG mistake. I will be hitting myself in the head for a long time to come because of this!
The prestige is without a doubt a MUST WATCH for EVERYONE who loves to guess whats going to happen only to be left feeling stupid. Without a doubt (another) 10/10 movie by the great Nolan."
" Fantastic

" Awesome Sauce!
",,"Period thriller that takes place in London where two magicians, friends until the death of one of their assistants during a show,starts an all out war between them after one of them performs the greatest magic trick of all time...teleportation
I was absolutely blown away. AMAZING!"
" Christopher Nolan is one of the best filmmakers the world has ever seen
",,"Plain and simple. You cannot dispute this fact. There are some filmmakers where from the very beginning you can tell that they are going to be legendary. Steven Spielberg obviously comes to mind, but I also think of filmmakers like Francis Ford Coppola, Clint Eastwood, Martin Scorsese, and James Cameron. But there's one other name that I think should be on that list: Christopher Nolan. This man has yet to make a film I didn't like or even didn't think was at least great. From the Dark Knight trilogy to Interstellar, from Inception to Dunkirk, this man has done so many amazing things with film-making today. I have yet to see his first three films ""Following,"" ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia,"" but from what I've heard, they are also great films. As for The Prestige, well, that is just another amazing films in a career of amazing films!The story is this: In London, there are two men named Robert Angier (played by Academy Award Nominee Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (played by Academy Award Winner Christian Bale). These men are helpers to a famous magician, but when a magic trick goes horribly wrong - thus resulting in the tragic death of somebody close to them - the two men turn on each other and become enemies, sabotaging the others' shows whenever they can. However, Alfred performs a trick that is so memorable that Robert is obsessed with finding the secret - an obsession that has tragic results.I've already talked about Christopher Nolan, but now let's turn our attention to the main cast. First off, to our two leading men: Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are equally superb in their parts. They keep you guessing every single time they are on screen - perfect for the role of magicians I'd say. But they are not alone: Golden Globe Nominee Scarlett Johansson plays Olivia, a woman stuck in between the rivalry of the two men. Unfortunately, Johansson is the weakest thing about this movie, but she's not actually there for too much of the movie, so it didn't hamper the movie's greatness. Academy Award Winner Michael Caine - a favorite actor of Christopher Nolan, since he has used him from everything since Batman Begins (whether it's a main part or a small voice cameo in Dunkirk) - is sort of like the narrator of the film, telling us what has happened and why the men became bitter rivals. He is always entertaining to watch, so he definitely pulls it off here.To put it simply: Go and see the movie! It's amazing! The vast majority of the actors know what they're doing, and Christopher Nolan...well, he's Christopher Nolan. Need I say more? Oh, and another thing that Christopher Nolan does well is twist/ambiguous endings, and boy does he pull it off with this one! Definite recommend!"
" One of christopher nolans most underrated films
",,This is one of those times where i will look at metacritic and just don't understand what i see. this is a brilliant work of cinema with christian bale and hugh jackman giving some of there best performances.
" The prestige.
",,The time line makes this movie good. The tricks are made perfectly and cannot be understood by us. But at the last scene we all know the tricks. The desire for the revenge makes them crazy.
" Nolan's direction and the actors make this movie magic
",,The Prestige is a great film by Christopher Nolan and it will take you probably more sittings than one to figure everything out. Strange that this came out the same year as the other film on magicians The Illusionist but I feel this one is a slightly better movie. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival magicians who will go to any length to get the better of the other. The performances are good. The film is long but you wont feel so and the cinematography and production design are top notch.
" wow! absolutely not!
",spoiler,Entertaining and exciting. there was so much terrible stuff and i hated it but by god was that a good movie! i want to give it a bad rating but i cannot! the stress that these two male leads gave me was unprecedented. unbelievable. how can you love someone and not reveal the trick? what would sarah knowing have changed? he drove her to alcoholism with his erratic behaviour and absolute depression since she hangs herself. also the revenge chain between the two was ridiculous (i absolutely believe they were capable of it but it was painful to watch). 'i don't care about my wife i care about the trick' and Angier's final explanation was amazing. my god!!! what a good film!! but did you really have to frame him for murder? really? murder? basically kill him?? kill him for it angier? isn't that too much? he didn't even do it on purpose bro. anyway WOW is the best way to describe the film.
" This movie is crimanaly underrated
",,"Just because Nolan made 
1. Interstellar (an epic space movie)
2. Dark night (First of it kind comic movie)
3. Inception (Truely masterpiece)This movie will always be counted after many of his title, when people will remembering his best workThis movie is masterpiece at every front:1. Character motivations
2. Rivalry (can't be this realistic)
3. Performances for actors, everyone was terrific
4. Cinematography, this movie is so easy on eyes
5. Editing, the less I say the best, masterfully doneAnd ofcourse, screenplay
I have seen it many times, and everytime the revelations from/via diary and magic acts amazes me"

" Wonderful Movie!!
",,"The film ""The Prestige"" is directed by Christopher Nolan in the year 2006. The basis of the film is adapted from the screenplay from 1995 by Christopher Priest which was also based on the novel of the same name. The novel won the World Fantasy award and was famous in the world of entertainment on its unique platform. Victorian London is the place where the movie took place, by keeping it in mind that at the following time and place, and black magic were believed in by the credulous. Somerset Maugham's novel The Magician captures that period perfectly in its fictional portrait of Aleister Crawley, ""the evilest man in the world"", in which the illusion is created of the one being really an occult practitioner of dark forces.
The Prestige is also plotted on the basis of illusion and magic which contains a touch of rivalry and passion. The movie has twist after twist which leads it to be successful in the film world. There are points when it will look like the movie has come to its conclusion; however, it is full of turns that keep the viewers engaged. The Duality, obsession, sacrifice, and secrecy pervading the conflict are the basic theme of the movie.
The main characters are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), Alfred Borden (Christopher Bale), Oliva Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson ) and John Cutter (Micheal Caine). All of these characters have strong interpersonal relationships. 
""The Prestige"" has almost about everything that is required in a movie about the world of magicians, except the prestige itself. The briefing by Michael Caine claims that every magic trick consists of three acts: (1) the pledge, an initial step in which a portrait of real situation gets set; (2) the turn, which is about challenging the initial reality; and (3) the prestige, where everything gets back to the normal and set situation again. 
The director tried his best to push the boundaries of their jaw-dropping parlour trick, from which the coherence of the movie's concept seems to be compromised due to the element of bunk.
The film ""The Prestige"" is rated PG-13 (parents strongly cautioned) since it has some violent scenes and a scary, menacing atmosphere; however, it is highly rated by the viewers.
Overall, this movie is a serious enigma, but I highly recommend that everyone watches this movie as its very entertaining and puzzling."
" ""The Prestige"" starts well but cheats with its own premise...
",,"There are many kinds of magic: wizardry à la 'Harry Potter', illusions or hallucinations, or entertaining shows: mediums, rabbits in top-hats, women sawed in half, bag-content guessing, magic cards etc. Speaking of cards, Christopher Nolan's ""Prestige"", made between two 'Batman' movies, lays its cards at the first voice-over monologue where we immediately recognize Michael Caine's smooth voice. It's about the third kind of magic and provides the three structural rules of an act: it starts with the Pledge: you show something normal then the Turn, you make it do something extraordinary... but there's an element of expectation and the higher your reputation goes, the more sophisticated the public. In fact, there's got to be something unpredictable, so it all comes down to the Prestige, the trick no one sees coming and will earn magicians applauses and guess what? prestige.Then, the least you can expect from the film is to follow these three rules even in the loosest possible way if it means wowing you with a spectacular surprise. And given that it's a Nolan film about the deadly art of illusion, much more opening with the killing of a magician, the imprisonment of his rival whom everything accuses, your twist-radar is set from the start, so not any twist will do. Whatever the prestige will be, if it's not venturing in the realm of feasibility, something will have been missed. We're dealing with magic after all, not fantasy, not sci-fi. I insist on the sci-fi element because the film opens with some electrical contraption that shakes its credibility from the start until a reassuring trap door shows and we can let a sight of relief go.French called electricity a Fairy so it all makes sense that magicians would use it as a device for generating illusion, just like rivals Edison and Tesla were perceived as wizards. After all, it's also established that magic is about what you see and what you don't and the use of lights and darkness is integral to the act. Still, I didn't like that machine. It felt incongruous and weird in a period drama and I was afraid Nolan would end up inserting some Batman-like device. And when he said in the ""making of"" video that he wanted to portray magic according to his personal vision of film-making, I thought ""no kidding?"", I'm pretty sure everyone got the parallel, especially when magical acts use special effects worthy of a Spielberg film. So Nolan gets a little carried away at the end while the first two acts of the movie had really gotten me involved, I mean the escalating rivalry between the two magicians Alfred Bowden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and their attempts to destroy one's act or find one's secret. What Nolan got right is that the rivalry mostly works as a foil to plunge us in the world of magic and know all the tricks. After all, that's the greatest thrill about magic, seeing how it works. For instance, the way a magician puts a dove in a cage and then flattens it to magically making the dove reappear under a handkerchief always made me scratch my head... but in this Dickensian universe where there's no pity for little children, why should there for innocent animals?The trigger of the rivalry also helps to understand how one of the most famous magic tricks, the ""escape from the tank water"" that made Houdini's reputation, is indirectly explained. Working as false audience members, Bowden and Angier are assigned to tie the magician's pretty assistant (Piper Perabo), one of them makes the kind of knot that doesn't leave any chance for the poor girl, who happens to be the other's wife. We gather that from then, it's personal. Another pivotal moment occurs when one conceives his masterpiece, an act that consists on getting in a door and coming out of another. He calls it ""The Transported Man"", for us, it looks like teleportation and it justifies why the rival is devoured by jealousy, although Caine's character can only see one explanation: there must be a double.At that point of the review, it's impossible to go further without spoiling the film. It's engaging enough to make you forget there's a twist but it's not spoiling the film to say that there's a twist, since it's the essence of magic. You've got to wow the audience with a surprise at the end. With the seemingly death of a character right at the start of the film, the battle to know everyone's tricks and the existence of a double, anyone could reassemble the pieces of the puzzle. But you know Nolan has more than a trick in his sleeve and that's both a blessing and a curse. Granted anticipations are to be toyed a little to be emotionally rewarded, all he had to do was working on the narrative structure to make what we know first a more effective reveal or a shock.Instead of that, Nolan relied on a far fetched revelation combined with an implementation that destroyed the whole atmosphere built throughout the film. From the start, we follow magicians who are dedicated to their passion, which is good, but the escalation toward sadism and some ends-justifying-the-means means made their whole approach to their art debatable, leaving no room for sympathy. In this cruel battle of wits, women are reduced to disposable pawns (Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johannsen would get more dimensional roles in a certain Woody Allen's movie). The first two acts, we can call them 'pledges' and 'turns' are great but then the film goes downhill. One thing for sure, I hated that Tesla Machine, and no offense to David Bowie, but Tesla was quite a handsome fellow whom I doubt spoke with such a heavy British accent. Nolan wanted his film-making to echo magic, but he let the reverse thing operate."
" The greatest movie of magic ever.

" Pulls off quite a few illusions of its own.
",,"'The Prestige (2006)' is a movie about illusions that manages to pull off quite a few of its own, with Nolan competently using cinematic techniques as a form of slight-of-hand. It cryptically tells you its many twists in its opening moments yet still manages to surprise with them. Yet, beyond the twists and turns lies a layered narrative centred around two well-crafted characters, one that impacts emotionally as well as intellectually. It is often forgotten amidst the plethora of Nolan's other work, but it sits just as highly as them and is, in my book, even a little underrated. 8/10"

" A Magical Experience
",,"Set in a dark and malice late-Victorian England, The Prestige is a diabolical and intriguing thriller film by one of the most critically acclaimed director of our era, Christopher Nolan, about two stage magicians engaged in a competitive one-upmanship in an attempt to create the ultimate stage illusion. This competition leads to sinister proceedings that moves both the story and audience to an ambivalent and ominous state. It's a tale of obsession and deception, a magic trick that creates a lasting impression. The movie follows a solid story structure that made all the acts propulsive and fast-paced. Nolan's mastery of cinematic deception and visual illusions enables the film to proceed in a non-chronological yet understandable sequence. The changing of time and space between each cut makes the story engaging and entertaining to watch. The puzzles and tricks that were utilized makes the audience be part of the problem-solving in each scene, and although the answers are right in front of our eyes, Nolan still managed to hide them in plain sight, and were only revealed at the very last moment.The characters in the story are lovable, relatable, human, and well- developed. The performance of the actors gave justice to their characters. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman's portrayal of the two magicians propelled the rivalry of their respective characters to a grander height that helped on amplifying the overall emotion that drives the story forward. Cinematography wise, the film is indeed magical. The utilization of visual illusions and tricks through editing reflected the theme of the story, which is deception. The use of parallax effects made each act more watchable. The overall lighting and music throughout the film created a dark and gloomy ambiance which made the movie overall, a more thrilling experience. The Prestige tells the story of humanity's obsession and greed for power through two magicians who are willing to take all means necessary to top the other. It's a tale of demise amplified by suspense, deceit, compulsion, and avarice. It's an intelligent and cerebral film that is easy to understand when you watch it carefully. The amount of its rewatchability which is kind of rare on today's films makes each viewing a different and delightful experience. This is a film I would recommend to everyone especially to those who enjoy thriller films that is full of puzzles. The story of The Prestige is already commendable to its roots but if we look carefully towards its lessons, we will realize how rewarding this film really is. As said in the movie, we know the truth but we want to be fooled because of our desire to be amazed. Learning the truth however doesn't kill the magic, but brings the magic within us.#EAPP2017"
" Nolan performs a great illusion with this one
",spoiler,"Set around the turn of the 20th century, this tale focuses on two highly skilled magicians. The pair begin working together but when a tragic event occurs by way of a professional mistake committed by one of the men, both of them end up in a rivalry that increases in negativity after one of them performs a trick which seems to have no logical explanation. This leads both magicians down a road laced with envy and obsession. The ultimate destination is the greatest trick ever but at what cost?I think this could very well be Christopher Nolan's best film after Memento (2000). It's very clever and plays upon cinema's inherent ability of creating an illusion. The whole story here in many ways is an elaborate magic trick. Like the best illusions it works because of subtle sleight of hand and misdirection which fools the audience until we are given the payoff. The final reveal seems to have been a little controversial with some considering its sci-fi underpinnings a cheat but which I thought was ultimately satisfying in that it emphasised the tragic nature of the obsession that led the magician to create his greatest ever trick. Told in three separate time-lines, this is quite a layered story that benefits from a re-watch. As in Memento, Nolan never cheats the audience and lays out all the clues in front of us but his skill as a director means that most of us don't piece them together until the finale. It's quite a skill to do this and is testament to Nolan's ability as a very cerebral film-maker. Aside from Nolan's technical and creative input, this one works because it has high calibre actors to draw us in, with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale adding the emotional intensity in the roles of the warring magicians, while Michael Caine provides the heart as their one-time mentor. Add to this the great historical detail and production design and the result is a period-set film with a very modern feel. If I had to add a criticism it would be the introduction of the actor who was a dead-ringer for Jackman – this felt to me to be a little too unbelievable and convenient. But aside from minor gripes such as this, I found this to be a very clever and involving bit of work."
" A cinematic sleight-of-hand
",,"Easily taking the crown of best magician-based movie of 2006 - swamping the distinctly wonder-less and barely remembered The Illusionist - Christopher Nolan's The Prestige is a cinematic sleight-of-hand; an enigma of a movie that is both a puzzle-box of misdirection and an engrossing tale of two warring magicians. When I first saw Nolan's fifth feature (and his second working with his brother and occasional writing partner Jonathan), its 'big reveal' seemed obvious to me early on in the third act, so when the grand revelations came at the climax, I was left feeling somewhat underwhelmed. In the years since, The Prestige has emerged as a firm favourite amongst Nolanites, so I was eager to re-visit it without the added pressure of trying to navigate through the film's many smokes and mirrors. Without this on my back, I could only sit back and admire a true craftsman at work, even though the narrative pushes the boundaries of credibility.In 1890s London, two apprentice magicians from two vastly different backgrounds work for Milton (real-life magician Ricky Jay), assisting in a nightly trick involving a glamorous assistant and a tank of water. Hugh Jackman is Robert Angier, a handsome, charismatic American from a privileged background. Christian Bale plays Alfred Borden, a rough Cockney and magic purist. While Angier knows how to get an audience excited and keep them entertained, Borden is a sullen stage presence, choosing to challenge his audience rather than dazzle them. The real brains behind it all is Cutter (Michael Caine), the craftsman and adviser who builds all the apparatus and devices required for the increasingly elaborate tricks. After a Milton performance goes fatally wrong, Angier and Borden begin a personal and professional rivalry that will play out over the years. They sabotage each other's shows, steal secrets, and try to perfect the ultimate magic trick: The Transported Man.Cutter explains the three-step theory on what makes a great illusion. There's the pledge (the set-up), the turn (the moment that grabs the audience's attention), and the prestige (the pay-off, when whatever has been disappeared is brought back again). It's what separates a jaw-dropping, head-scratching moment from a cheap card trick, and is precisely what separates the The Prestige from The Illusionist. Nolan truly understands the mechanics behind the prestige, after all, he toyed with our expectations and our perception of time with Memento. He wraps The Prestige up in a cloak of mystery, employing time-jumps and subtle camera tricks to keep the audience constantly engaged in trying to piece everything together. Nearly everything is key to unlocking the film's secrets, even the seemingly routine sub-plots involving Borden's wife (played by Rebecca Hall) and glamorous new assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson struggling with an English accent).The inclusion of David Bowie's Nikola Tesla and Angier's quest to convince the engineer and physicist to build him a machine required to pull off the ultimate trick may be a step too far for some viewers. Tesla's involvement stretches science into the supernatural, and clashes with the grounded world built up until this point. But Bowie is terrific, and the frequent presence of Thomas Edison's goons offers some historical context, as well as an allegory for the obsessive rivalry between the two central characters. Jackman is very good at switching between hero and anti- hero, his hands increasingly dirtied trying to outmanoeuvre his rival, and while Bale can add Borden to his list of grating accents, he wins our sympathies despite the coldest of demeanours. Caine, Nolan's go-to exposition tool, also provides reliable support as the fatherly voice of reason, However, the real stars are the brothers Nolan, who arguably lay all their cards on the table in the opening scenes, for anybody paying close attention. But pay attention or not, you'll be swept up either way"
" Are You Watching Closely? Abracadabra!
",spoiler,"If you have seen other films of Nolan you may be used to his special way of doing movies (with complex plots, some twists and a special way of filming, capturing the essence of the movie and the story perfectly). But if you're new in his filmography, you must watch this movie without missing any detail and trying to figure out any possible ending you feel could be in here, so the movie, at the end won't hit you in the face that much.The Prestige tells us the story of two magicians and their story of rivalry, how they fight with each other to get the magic tricks of the other and also tells the story of revenge of one of them, Robert Aniger (Hugh Jackman), after the other magician, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) kills his wife in an accident during a magic show. The movie starts with Robert Angiers doing a magic trick and apparently dying trapped in a water tank, and after that Alfred Borden is accused of killing and is put into the jail. Here he receives the diary of Robert and from here the story moves backward and forward to tell us the beginning of their rivalry, the discoveries of each other and how they try to steal the magic trick from the other.The last half hour of this movie is portrayed in such an amazing way that will keep you staring at the screen and wondering what is happening. For this amazing finale, you have two amazing actors, Hugh Jackman as Robert Angiers & Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, both creating superb performances, both going crazy to get the tricks of the other and both having such an emotional part at the end of the movie. Also, they're helped by one of Nolan most frequent collaborations, the legendary Michael Caine in the role of Cutter, one of the managers of Robert Angiers. Also I have to do a special mention to Scarlett Johansson as Olivia, Rebecca Hall as Sarah, David Bowie as Tesla and Andy Serkis as Alley. They all did a great job in the supporting roles and they add a lot to the story and the movie in general.One of the few negative things I have to say about this movie are for example, that at times it felt too long, because there were some parts were nothing was happening, they were just talking without any development on the story. Also, some of the secondary characters I have mentioned before, like Olivia, Tesla or Alley (I'm not talking about the actors. It's about the character itself) were underused with actors like Scarlett Johansson, Andy Serkis or David Bowie, and at the end they just disappear and you don't get to know anything about them.Other great thing of the movie is, as always, the amazing camera work Nolan uses in here, capturing the feeling of menace, rage, darkness and so on along the entire movie. He really captures the feelings of the story and transmits them to you. Especially in the final half hour of the movie, when you slowly discover the reality, he captures the feelings and keeps you in tension until the end. All of this is accompanied by a great score by David Julyan, which don't have any musical climax, but is a great atmospheric score that helps the movie to develop well.Overall I recommend this movie to any fan of Nolan and to who want to be surprised by a great and not much known movie. ""Now you're looking for the secret. But you won't find it because of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to work it out. You want to be fooled."
" Are you watching closely
",,"The Prestige, it's unbelievably good. This film is full of twists and terns from start to finish with amazing performances from an all star cast! One of the best friendship turned rivalry films or all time a must see by all with a brilliant ending i can't urge people enough to watch this 9/10 performance 9/10 originality 10/10 direction 8/10 story 9/10 ending 10/10"
" Magnificent. Brilliant.
",,"I don't know why I don't give this 10. It's perhaps a principal. This movie deserves all the praise in the world.This movie combines so many satisfying elements. It's an extremely well written movie that will turn and twist the plot several times, and make sure you are left with a million questions.But at the end, all those questions are answered. Ahh, and the satisfaction.An emotionally strong, deceptively clever, star class performed, visually stunning, and magic induced movie that perhaps shows us the very best of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, in a vicious battle of rivals as two magicians will do anything in their power to outperform the other. Also, ""sophisticated"", I believe, deserves to be mentioned as a key keyword for this movie. Beautiful.I don't care who you are, or whether you like ""these kind of movies"" or not, it's still something you must see. The world of movies would not be the same without The Prestige."
" An interesting story about two disgusting characters.
",,"This film addresses the intense rivalry between two illusionists who try to overcome and injure each other after a serious and fatal accident in a joint show. It's a story of unbridled rivalry, revenge, pride and vanity. The film has many merits but the main one is the script, the story that tells us. There are some more predictable parts, others seem initially incomprehensible until the movie explains everything. The ending is one of the most positive aspects as it's totally unexpected and, in fact, makes everything else worthwhile. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman played the main characters, working very well together and showing us the best of each other. They are brilliantly aided by veteran Michael Caine and by Scarlett Johansson. David Bowie is a surprise, but was quite reasonable in the role of the famous physicist Tesla. In fact, the whole cast did a good job and met expectations, at times when it failed to shine. However, the great problem of this film is precisely the characters. They are detestable, especially the magicians. No one was able to deserve my sympathy and, deep down, I was glad to see both of them being punished for their wickedness. Caine, in his character, mirrored this repulsion very well at certain scenes. And while Tesla's machine allowed a good increment to the story, the way it was done was so far-fetched that it spoiled the movie a bit, too. Anyway, it's a good movie with a very interesting story, fulfilling well its mission to entertain and surprise the public."
" 6/10
",,"The Prestige was decent film filled with and excellent cast, sadly the Storyline limits this movie. It is too prolonged for the plot, though it was an interesting and entertaining movie for the first 30 minuets it gets old and lacks serious substance aside from trivial feuds and shallow romance. I appreciated the realism of the dialog and admire the challenge it must have been to maintain the attention of viewers solely with the use of magic tricks but feel strongly that the length of the movie was too drawn out for the boring and anti climatic ending. Sadly it was predictable and lacked originality aside from setting and the occupation of the characters."
" Goes Deeper than Necessary,
",,"The Prestige is a good movie with a very well developed plot and a stellar cast. It is a bizarre journey as we follow the lives of two competing magicians who go through extreme lengths to exceed the other. Things begin to heat up quite fast, with some very bizarre twists and turns throughout, showcasing the complications these magicians go through to make everything appear magic. However. I felt the plot dives deeper than it really should have, there are some very absurd moments and the exaggeration took me out of the movie a bit. I also found the tone far too dark, it should have been a more light hearted look at the dedication of magicians, instead of going as far as to bring teleportation, cloning and suicide in to the story. While it can feel a bit pretentious, The Prestige is a really unique movie, worth the watch if you are looking for a good mystery. Two magicians begin to feud after one performs the ultimate trick, teleportation. Best Performance: Christian Bale"
" Are you watching closely?
",,"The Prestige is one of those rare films that truly reward repeated viewing. One would think that a film that relies so heavily on a twist at the end would feel flat the second time around but instead knowing how things fit together allows you to fully appreciate how masterfully it is all foreshadowed.The script is great, the editing is brilliant and the vision required to bring this to life is staggering. I have watched it three times now and I'm yet to find a flaw in how this is put together. My appreciation grows with each new viewing. The cinematography is great as well. For a period piece it feels remarkably fresh and almost contemporary.The acting is good if not great. Christian Bale gives a restrained but nuanced performance as Borden while Hugh Jackman impresses as his nemesis Angier. Not Oscar-worthy material but more than serviceable. Among the supporting cast it's worth mentioning Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife Sarah and Michael Caine as Cutter. They both provide the heart and soul of this movie, a counterpoint to the single-minded obsession shown by the two protagonists. David Bowie and Andy Serkis are always a delight to watch even if their parts here are fairly small.A great study in the nature of obsession and how it brings two men into a downward spiral that can only end in disaster. And the journey is just so, so enjoyable. Christopher Nolan's best movie, which is saying something. 10 stars out of 10."
" Nolan's Prestige.
",spoiler,"The Prestige (2006): Dir: Christopher Nolan / Cast: Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall: Spellbinding film about the explanations behind magic. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play rival magicians with a life long rivalry bent on figuring out the other. Controversy rises when a female apprentice drowns in a tank in a trick that backfired. Christopher Nolan previously made the best of the Batman series in Batman Begins as well as directing the clever thriller Memento. Here he examines the explanations and challenges of magic with tremendous sets and acts to overwhelm the mind. Jackman is excellent as an accomplished magician out to perfect the transporting act. Bale as the rival is married and has a daughter but spends much time in prison for murder. Scarlett Johansson plays an apprentice of Jackman's sent to achieve Bale's secrets. Finally there is Michael Caine who voices reason and the mystery behind it all. Rebecca Hall plays Bale's wife while Piper Perabo plays the wife of the Jackman character. Nolan is among the most intelligent of directors and seems confident in creating suspense as well as leave audiences guessing but the ending here may be questionable to some if not brilliantly vengeful. It doesn't believe magic so much as believe its illusion and utter disappointment. Score: 9 / 10"
" A lot of tricks revealed, but not much of story
",,"Nice attempt to pictures the rivalry among contemporary magicians of old times.Throughout the movie there are many popular magic tricks which you will know how they are done. That was only thing to keep you interested.I would have been happier if movie was more about its story rather than ""how to do this trick"" lesson.Though there is nice script and nice acting. Nice picturization of the level of commitment, the magicians show for developing an illusion and the limits they can go to do that. ................... .................. ....................... ...................... ...................."
" Prestigious
",,"If you are a fan of surprises, twists and turns then this movie is for you. The movie in itself is magic. You couldn't predict the next two scenes if you tried. A classic Christopher Nolan piece with Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman at their very best. In my opinion Nolan should have clinched an Oscar for directing this film as his interpretation of the novel was fantastic with his usual awesome add-ons of course.Another reason why i rated this movie 10/10 was because of Bale's sublime performance. He has collaborated with Nolan on previous projects and i have enjoyed every single one of them. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who loves suspense as there is a lot of unpredictability in here."
" A Masterpiece
",,Additionally to the great cast this movie is very exciting and shows many turns and twists. Christopher Nolan proved once more why he is one of the most wanted director of this time. I am not a fan of magic but this movie is less about magic then about showing how rivalry and the obsession to better than the other can destroy the people. The movie starts off exciting right away and it continues to hold the viewers attention. There is so many twist and changes through the entire movie and nevertheless the viewer never gets confused. This is definitely a movie that is fun to watch and that is definitely worth getting. Also with again world class performances of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. This is the perfect movie for having a quiet evening and still wanting to watch an exciting and agitating movie.
" Interesting Duality Concept on Dark Competitive Spirits of Professional Magicians
",,"Before the successful of their big blockbusters, the Nolan's siblings explore the world of stage magicians by summarising the magic performances into three parts - the pledge, the turn and the prestige, which the movie further develops based on the structures although it starts off slowly with its own unique beginning. It seems that in most Nolan's film, the ending scene always appears at the opening but his narrative style however manages to make audiences to forget that regardless on the complexity of the content he tries to confuse us, it is actually a straightforward plot with the key answers already revealed indirectly at the first scene. The performances of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are extremely outstanding, thanks to the character developments that allow them to be both the antagonist and protagonist at the same time due to their eagerness for glory that they have eroded not only the morality of this magical great art, but to sacrifice their own lives and the one they love. The duality is a brilliant central concept of the film extracted in two different ways on both leads, it never stops engaging but to challenge the mindset of the viewers with several dark twisted plots and ambiguity. Although with a bit of weaker scores (due to no Hans Zimmer), Nolan's smart piece of magical art is interesting to stress that the trick of victory comes only when a person overlook and think that he has already won the rival."
" MY MOVIES: Nolan's Magic!!
",,"The Prestige. Every magic trick has three parts. The pledge where you show something ordinary, The Turn where you make that ordinary thing disappear and The Prestige where you make that thing appear again. Without The Prestige, a magic trick is worthless. On the same line, Nolan's magical movie works. He starts you showing few ordinary humanly characters, surprises you with its twists and turns of the story and then leave you speechless and awed at the end.Centred around the professional and personal rivalry of two magicians played by charismatic Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, The Prestige is a genius work of Christopher Nolan. With its non-linear story telling, he keeps you glued to the show of magic and life of magicians. With is period setting, great visuals, delicious dialogs and top notch performances by its lead and supporting actors like Michael Caine, Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson, Nolan creates a feast of cinematic magic.There are hardly any loose ends and revelations at the end, even if you saw them coming much earlier are great enough to leave you impressed. What also works in favour, that it is a mind bender and you might like to revisit to enjoy it more and more.I am going with mind blowing 9 out of 10 for The Prestige. As it is said in the movie, people love to be fooled in this otherwise simple world, The Prestige is nothing less than a great magic trick played in front of you leaving you smiling and clapping at the end."
" Good storytelling is the real trick
",,"The complex machinations and constant time shifting writer/director Christopher Nolan employs in 'The Prestige' could very easily have derailed the entire movie, leaving it an utterly confusing mess. Instead, Nolan masterfully weaves these threads together and crafts a tale of obsession, one-upsmanship and revenge that will hold you in its spell for its entire 130 minute runtime, and then send backtracking for the clues you missed.The cast really shine here, inhabiting their characters and bringing them to three dimensional life. Bale and Jackman are terrific as the obsessed rivals at the center of the film, and supporting players Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine and Rebecca Hall are every bit their equal.'The Prestige' is an intelligent, well-crafted tale. Not to be missed."
" My all time favorite movie so far!
",spoiler,"With The Prestige, Christopher Nolan, once again, offers a breathtaking movie. Between illusion and delusion, the story never ceases to amaze.In the London of the end of the 19th century, two rival stage-magicians compete in creating the most amazing act. In the course of events, Alfred Borden (Portrayed by award-Winning actor Christian Bale)is arrested for the murder of Robert Angier (Whom Hugh Jackman plays with great skill). The movie centers on the discovery of truth and the explanation of the great magic trick Alfred Borden created.The Prestige really is one of the greatest movies I have seen. It is simply brilliant. I would recommend it to everyone and anyone who likes suspenseful movies with great plots."
" Let me see if I understand it

So Batman goes off and starts doing his own thing and it becomes a big rivalry between Batman and Wolverine, probably because Alfred decided to hang out with Wolverine. So Batman and Wolverine keep one-upping each other and Wolverine shoots off two of Batman's fingers. Then Wolverine hires The Black Widow to do some spy stuff but she double crosses Wolverine and falls for Batman but Batman is already married to former Iron Man booty call Maya Hansen. Batman's wife finds out and kills herself. Meanwhile, Wolverine got really messed up because Batman sabotaged one of Wolverine's tricks and now Wolverine limps around. Black Widow brought Wolverine Batman's diary but it was a trick but Wolverine didn't know and then Batman tells him a secret and so Wolverine goes to America to find Ziggy Stardust. Ziggy Stardust and his assistant Gollum build Wolverine this crazy device that makes clones or something and Wolverine uses it to become the super awesome magician and then Batman tries to sabotage him and gets framed for killing Wolverine and goes to Death Row. But it was just Wolverine's clone and now Wolverine has Batman's kid but Alfred gets mad and helps Batman... except that there are two Batmans and one of them gets hanged and the other shoots Wolverine and then goes and gets the kid, that I think is his but it might be his niece... I don't know... Christopher Nolan needs to stop taking drugs.The End."
" A film for intelligent types who like to have a good think.
",spoiler,"I'd never even heard of this movie when it was shown on TV and only decided to give it a watch after I read that Michael Caine and David Bowie were in the cast.I was immediately caught up in the story line, which is almost totally believable, considering the function of the Tesla machine this is no mean feat of writing and acting. It was totally engaging from start to finish.The scene where a young boy starts crying because he believes a canary has been killed is a massive clue to the whole mystery, which is revealed right at the end. This is one movie that I am looking forward to seeing again, it's not often one says that."
" Twist after twist.
",spoiler,"Well at first i wasn't sure about this film, i looked who was in it and thought ""great actors, ill give it a try"" and i am so glad i did, it is by far one of my best films. It is just twist after twist after twist and the film shocks you all the way through. The film itself is very clever and well thought out.The actors play their part amazingly and perfectly. To be fair the film ""wowed"" me, it really did, it was very interesting, had humour too, i was hooked, watching it from start to finish in amazement. I hope another film like this comes out soon, i really enjoyed it and would recommend to anyone who loves a film with lots of twists and great acting.9 - 10 / 10."
" Keeps You guessing .........Blows your mind away.......Fantastic
",,"As a Christopher Nolan Fan i must tell you that this movie is a feather in a cap for him along with Inception and Dark Knight. Absorbing performance from Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine. The movie keeps you guessing. You think he wins it, no he doesn't, oh again he does it but he didn't. It was a spectacle for me. This movie tells us human life is simple with no magic but when you do something tricky people wonder about it and appreciate it. Same thing applies for this movie. This movie just more personifies Nolan's Directorial talent. Expects him to give equally more good movies. Hats Off......But how many....you will know it when you watch it."
" The Prestige
",,"The film has a pace to it which is satisfying and enjoyable, and it is fast to take off. The complexities of the story are involved from the word go; as the film begins at a stage just moments from the conclusion, when characters have already been defined, and the plot fully explored. It then progresses to the past, and, narrated partially by a friend of the two magicians (Caine), the story of how the men came to be where they have just been shown to have ended up is told. Already, you have been privy to scenes which are, though not entirely understood by you (as the lead-up to these scenes has not yet been viewed); they are still pleasantly electric and exciting. As you start to see more of the past, and to know the characters and their stories, you begin to feel anxious for the future of these people, watching with the fervent hope that all will turn out as it should, but knowing from what you have already seen that this is not so. You are, in this way, captured by the story from the moment it begins - caught up in the suspense of a semi-revealed outcome and the lives and feelings of a multitude of characters. Such interlocking of the story continues throughout the entire film, as flashes of the present are coupled with those of the past, and the truth can only be yearned for."
" Full throttled, Gripping and Leave you amused!
",,Without any doubt this movie comes in top 10 best movies I have ever watched in my lifetime till date and It will surely be for a coming long time. Nothing of this tale left you unsatisfied or bored at a single second. Truly a masterpiece to must have in one's video library. hats off to all the team! Human emotions represented at most vibrant colors and zest of passion of one's mad obsession. Another aspect which drives this movie more near to my heart is the Scientific historical facts used as baseline of story. Magic is not just a game but a way of life. I have watched it numerous times and still it keeps its freshness alive every time I repeat it. Christian bale has surely discovered his best acting career through this movie. Each and every character of this movie is just awesome!
" Good Movie from Christopher Nolan
",,"As I expected from Christopher Nolan's movies, The Prestige is a good one. It is about the story of two obsessed magicians that compete to become a true ""great magician"". The acting of Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman who become the main characters for this movie is quite good. But I think Michael Caine is the true masterpiece, his acting is really good and he becomes the ""Nolan'secret"" in this movie.And of course, Christopher Nolan can make this movie's ending unpredictable. I give 8 for this movie because of the plot and the acting of the actor/actress are good and the situation is like Dark Knight, dark situation. I am a fan of Christopher Nolan's movies so I think this is one of the must watch movies."
" awesome movie
",,"The prestige is awesome. I have to say this is one of the best movies i have seen. You couldn't ever imagine what will happen in every scene because we must think a little bit hard. This movie has a lot of secrets. I love one sentence in this movie. ""Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it because you're not really looking. You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled. "" The acting from all actors, especially Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) & Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) are very good, they compete each other to prove who is the best magician and make a new trick in every scene. I think the prestige is one of Nolan's best movies."
" I wish I could give this movie a ten...
",,"... but after watching it quite a few times I have to honestly say something is missing for me. I remember watching it for the first time, I was quite impressed by the story, the way it was built up and delivered, the cast and the acting, and basically everything about the movie. I think the point where it becomes a little too much is towards the end of the movie. Without giving out spoilers I can say that the ending is something you would expect but is still shocking, although by the time it arrives you already know everything that's going on and this way it doesn't hit you as hard as it should. I have to absolutely mention that I liked everything about this film and I still love and will always love this movie. But my mind just doesn't want to settle with a ten for some reason."
" Two magicians on the edge of obsession
",,"The film prestige"" is set in London centers around two rivaling magicians in the late 19th century. The budding performers Robert Angier and Alfred Borden both work for the engineer Cutter, who creates the machinery for their tricks. Competition between the two men advances and a dispute arises when Borden's suggestion to use an alternate knot tying technique for one of their tricks is rejected by Angier and Cutter. The collaboration between the two magicians experiences a definite rupture when Angier's wife, assistant to a dramatic trick on stage, drowns in a water tank as she is unable to untangle herself in time from a knot Borden had tied. Angier blames Borden for his wife's death and is increasingly filled with bitterness as he observes his contestant living a seemingly happy life with wife and daughter and at the same time challenging his fame as a magician. The two magicians closely track one another's shows and are gradually more daring to use dirtier techniques in order to damage one another's status as a magician. While Angier is sided by Cutter, Borden has his own mentor, Fallon, with whom he develops dangerous and at the same time ingenious tricks. Having started from rough living conditions, Borden advances to an increasingly successful performer with a yet uncontested show demonstrating his own disappearance and reappearance. Angier, unable to grasp the secret behind Borden's performance, seeks help from the scientist Tesla in the USA and returns with his own interpretation of the ""transported man"". The two opponents have in common their desire for prestige and fascination for magic. These traits increasingly degenerate into an obsession, leading to an alienation from reality and, in the end, demanding a high price. As introduced at the beginning of the film, each trick has three parts, the pledge, where an ordinary object is presented to the audience; the turn, where the object is turned into something unexpected; and the prestige, where the object is brought back. In seeking uncontested prestige in the life of magic, Angier and Borden experience, that in real life, once lost, some things cannot be brought back. Christopher Nolan's film depicts a dark side of the world of magic in which magicians have to go far in order to gain admiration and amazement from the audience, which expects more than a simple trick."
" A film that left me impressed and amazed, and made me want to watch it again and again.
",,"The Prestige is about two magicians whom have been friends and co- workers in the past, but this rivalry begins with the two and ends up destroying their friendship. Magicians are known for scamming the audience into believing something that's not real. Well, that's exactly what the Prestige delivers.Hugh Jackman was outstanding as this irritated, fixated magician gaining back his life by revenge. Christian Bale was just as impressive as the baffling and mysterious showman. The rest of the cast ended being acceptably and well done as their charactersChristopher Nolan in fact has a contribution at directing. The way this film delivers the scenarios between the different places and times is well done and smart. It is a possible to some viewers that the film, Prestige, will leave the viewers confused, and might not actually like it, but there will be others who will enjoy the film entirely and be adored by it. It is not for everyone. The film remains into this world of presumption the entire time until the end. It will keep the viewer guessing and wondering what's going to happen next. The script, acting, surroundings, support, and everything were a superb."

But how willing are they to get their hands dirty and do they have the commitment that is required to pull off the trick? The films' darkness is appropriate as Christopher Nolan maximizes the story, while his cast and spins his seduced audience. It's difficult to not get reeled in by the storyline and we are even told the tricks, but the astonishment of the prestige still amazes! The film begins with the line,""Are you watching closely?"" and yet when it's all over you will need to ask yourself the question again and again!"

I won't add a lot of information, but if you haven't seen this movie yet, and are reading these reviews first, and/or if you like magic, fantasy, and suspense thrillers, watch this movie ASAP. You will not regret it. It's worth it! By the way, make sure you don't read the plot/summary AT ALL. Even if you read a single line by mistake, it may be the suspense and you might spoil the movie for yourself! Also, make sure you watch this movie in complete silence. It's quite complicated, but trust me, don't stop! Continue watching it. It's honestly not a movie to watch on a party etc."

Interesting thing is the double character of Borden, by Borden and his like brother Fallon, As they share their life with Sarah(Borden's wife) and Olivia (Female assistant). Angier is shown as a jealous man, in start ruining Borden's show in revenge of his life but later, he does everything in his rage. Borden, a nice showman but due to him his wife and mother dies. John Cutter, Angier's old male assistant, a gentle man, due to whose evidence Fallon the mistaken Borden dies. Olivia, female assistant of Angier, who shows propensity to Borden on urge of Angier to take Borden's secret. Fallon, mistaken Borden, dies for his brother, sacrifices many times, such sacrifices make him die. ""Are you watching closely"", is the thing that castes a spell on the spectator. Movie captures mind of a viewer and slowly moves in a twisting manner, but at the Borden and Angier's final meeting ends In a really magnificent unveiling manner. In such a manner that one watching this movie feels its effect for a long time. Conclusion is that, Movie is fantastic, though having many thongs un-explained but this is for viewers own minds' capability to create and look beneath the surface. Movie has many aspects that tell how a person becomes so selfish, in jealousy that he forgets his moral values too, even his loved ones. The curiosity sometimes proves to be lethal. And heeding much on un-important issues can make one suffer. Finally, Movie has an amazing end, and suggestion is that viewers must watch it . AR Bilal"
" The Best Movie of 2006 and One of the Best in the whole film industry
",,"Sorry for the review, but I am not English so there are some mistakes I am sure. :) What I wrote in the summery is true in my opinion. It's sure that this is one of my favorite movie. I think that was the biggest fail of the year that the actors and the director got nothing in the Academy Awards. And I can't imagine which movie was better than this in 2006? Because 2006 was one of the worst year in the film industry in my opinion. I remember just for a few good movie. I recommend the movie for everybody who like to think and not just watching the explosions (which I like, but this movie is about something else). It wasn't long for me, I think this is the kind of movie what I would call ""a perfect one"". I don't think that everybody could write a better ""Prestige"" then this. The sound effects and the music created a very good and formidable atmosphere. Oh and my favorite character was Tesla like in science. He was really one of the best scientist who ever lived, maybe better then any one else, but I don't want a debate about this. These are just my opinion. 10/10 More movies like this!!!"
" The prestige

You should find them because if you find them you will be happy ."
" One of the best films by Nolan
",,"I first should note that I am very rigorous regarding my scoring system. I give 7/10 only for very, very good films, perhaps only for the top 3-2% of all films (I gave Vertigo a 7/10, for instance), so 7/10 should be interpreted as a very good film, but not a masterpiece.I liked it very much, the characters are well constructed and strong and the performances are memorable and good well around. The ending has a very cool twist as well, though nothing really special: Nolan's films are very entertaining, but he is not a Stanley Kubrick and never will be. Don't watch these films expecting masterpieces, as some of Nolan's fanboys might think. But expect instead high quality entertainment."
" A thought-provoking movie
",spoiler,"I have watched it three times. Definitely worth watching for triller-lovers.The conflict between the two(actually, three) magicians has started since Angiers wife was accidentally killed by Borden. The result is foreshadowed in Cutters opening monologue, 'You don't really want to know, You want to be fooled', which is exactly why Angier was reluctant to believe that Borden simply used a double in The Transported Man. Angier and Borden are top magicians with different goals. For Angier, the audience's reaction is considered the most important. And Borden tends to innovate. Both of them are willing to sacrifice. One chooses to kill his clones (or maybe he is killed and replaced by the clone ? the thoughts can probably be cloned as well so the clones know what needs to be done about Borden ) every time he does The Transported Man, while the other sacrifices himself in order to make the tricks perfect. Regarding with the identical twins, Borden(the one got hung) and Fallon(the one killed Angier), I've been desperately trying to figure out which is which during my second viewing. The existence of a twin is also foreshadowed in a few scenes. For instance, when Sarah said she knew something secret about Borden, she must have already found out since she is the one closest to Borden and Fallon. And when Angier asked Fallon about the knot after the accident, he said he wasn't sure, because Borden was the one tied the knot, not him. One more thing, Borden/Fallon was able to see that the other magician pretended to be a cripple to hide the fish tank and Angier couldn't. It indicates that he knew because he has done something similar.A great movie with a great ending. The fact that Fallon appears in front of the daughter reinforces the idea of the third step of a magic trick, which is bringing back the ordinary. A thought-provoking movie as well. To what extent is sacrifice worthy in order to make everything perfect? Is what we see what is really happening, or is it what we want to see? "
" Dazzles in its Enigmatic Mystique
",,"Picture this: you're at a magic show and see an impossible but brilliant magic trick. A mix of awe and bewilderment consumes you as you lust after the answer you will not likely get. But here is an unrelenting quest for that answer, a determination to find out how for a cause which is dark, twisted and mystifying. Such is the way 'The Prestige' engrosses you. A period drama depiction of a unique post-renaissance art, 'The Prestige' shows the lengths to keep, attain and steal secrets, a story about power, pride and mind games with the viewers, the on-camera audience and the characters. We see what was the foundation of modern day magic but the darker, more cutthroat side of it which is both morally and ethically questionable. The film is based around a piece de resistance and the way in which the illusionary employed translates to treachery. The vicious circle of deceit and obsession for power and respect is mind- boggingly riveting. Christopher Nolan leads you on a path where everybody looks antagonistic and spiteful, he gradually changes your perceptions of people in ways which can be sudden and in others where you watch the morphing process as it unfolds, much like a stage tragedy sans the melodrama. The title works in such a contrasting manner to the film, the two protagonists aim for prestige but in doing so, seek to destroy one another's. The great shroud of mystique involved in this process is complicated and takes time to grip your mind from believing 'The Prestige' to be just another period drama. It was not a film that captures your imagination from square one even if it may with time. It ambles along in a manner befitting a magician revelling in his trickery but the pace can be frustrating, if only for the sin of curiosity. Christian Bale presents Alfred Borden as this arrogant, cocky lad but beneath that presumptuousness and pride lies a crafty and wily conniver but comfortably the more intelligent of the two illusionists. Bale shows this so subtly yet with panache through the character's actions which are brief but have wide ramifications. He also brings a sense of irony to the character, one in which he apparently disguises truth from himself making for a strangely compelling personality. This wild ambition meets Robert Angier's emotion, which drives him to sink to Borden's depths despite being a more astute character. Hugh Jackman's performance is an emotional roller-coaster, the character that Nolan uses to toy with our minds in this wonderfully curious manner, whose descent is portrayed with fervour. The female lead, Scarlett Johansson, is superbly enigmatic. She is the advertisement of the film representing the mystery and unpredictability embodying the story. The quintessential illusion is described at the beginning and the film plays out like these three acts building to 'the prestige', the big divulgence. Simple but sensational was how it struck me, but each to their own experiences, it depends what questions you desire to be answered. Nonetheless, whether it robs you of your dream reveal or gives it to you, you cannot deny the ingenuity surrounding the mystery ride you've been put on."
" Rival Stage Magicians
",spoiler,"The Prestige is a British-American mystery thriller film written, directed and co-produced by Christopher Nolan, with a screenplay adapted from Christopher Priest's novel of the same name. The story follows Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, rival stage magicians in London at the end of the 19th century. Obsessed with creating the best stage illusion, they engage in competitive one-upmanship with tragic results.The film features Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. It also stars Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, Rebecca Hall, and Andy Serkis. Priest's epistolary novel was adapted to the screen by Nolan and his brother, Jonathan Nolan, using nonlinear narrative structure. Obsession, jealousy, and deceit define the tense relationship shared between two turn-of-the-century magicians in Memento and Batman Begins director Christopher Nolan's dizzying tale of sleight of hand. Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden are London-based magicians of the highest order, both blessed with spectacular powers of deception and both cursed with unrelenting envy for one another's skills. When Alfred performs an awe-inspiring trick for which there seems no logical explanation, the friendly competition shared between the pair turns to deadly rivalry as the enraged Rupert determines to uncover his rival's deepest secrets. In the world of illusion, however, nothing is ever quite as it seems, and the rules of the physical world simply don't apply. Now, as bitter competition quickly begins to consume the souls of both performers, the firestorm birthed by their anger threatens to consume all who surround them. It's quite a movie -- atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic.It is never less than engaging, though considering that the title The Prestige refers to the moment in a magic act that gives it its ""wow"" factor, it's kind of a shame that the ultimate ""reveal"" in the movie is a little too tricky for its own good.Jackman and Bale give standout performances as rivals whose mutual obsession destroys all sense of perspective and ruins lives.Overall,full of twists and turns, it is a dazzling period piece that never stops challenging the audience."
" probably the greatest movie i have ever seen
",,"the prestige is not only a movie as it is a masterpiece. apart from the acting, which extraordinary and amazing to watch, the plot and the way the story was built are the things which really stand out. firstly, it is not a movie for everyone as it requires some concentration and thinking. the plot is sophisticated in just a different way that is built by such a perfect manner, you wont see anything like it. the ending will leave you breathless and the final sentence will show you that this movie is the best. the only problem i face is that after watching this movie i could not see other movies as nothing can compare to this mesmerizing masterpiece/"
" poor cinema
",,"Why is this described as a thriller, a mystery? It had neither thrill, nor mystery, nor intelligence for that matter. When I look for movies to watch I always mention my favorites (Memento, The Game etc.) hoping for similar kind of cinematic entertainment, and eventually this movie came up. It was supposed to be as intense, interesting and intelligent as the mentioned ones. But, it was just one big disappointment. Maybe, if I had no expectations, the experience of watching it would have been better...I suppose this might be thrilling and suspenseful for someone who usually doesn't prefer that genre and is used to the ""lighter"" movies you don't have to put much thought in. But even for that person this wouldn't be the first pick for an evening at the cinema, so I really don't understand the amount of attention this movie got."
" movieinthepark.blogspot.com
",spoiler,"Back in town, Chris Nolan gave the world one of his best masterpieces. He's without any doubt one of the best directors of the current times. There ain't who does better breathtaking mysteries and sharp thrillers that just delight who ever enjoys mind breaking stories. With The Prestige, Nolan explores the fruitful world of magics. The story's about two magicians, somewhere around 1900. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). At first they were helping a magician performing his acts. The major act consisted in tying Angier's wife's hands (Julia (Piper Perabo)) and drop her in a cage filled with water. A huge cloth would came down covering it and when it was pushed back up Julia should have already untied the knot and escaped from the cage. Before a show, Angier, Borden and the engineer of illusions, Cutter (Michael Caine) argued about which knot should be used, as Borden defended that another knot to replace the one being used, but both Angier and Cutter refused. In that exact show, Julia drowns inside the cage. Angier immediately blames Borden. Angier and Borden take different paths, Angier hires Cutter as his engineer and Borden Bernard Fallon as his. Angier also hires Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) to help him on stage. Meanwhile, Borden meets and marries Sarah (Rebecca Hall). Performing a trick that Borden called The Bullet Catch, Angier shows up in a Borded's show offering himself to volunteer and tricks Borden, injuring him severely on two fingers. Progressively, competitiveness grows between both. The plot develops with this competition, as each one of them creates the most elaborate and schemer acts of London and try to uncover the partner's in order to beat him. It's amazing how Nolan concentrates the mystery of the tricks until the very last moments, focusing all the answers in the end. If the viewer focuses on certain details he might find possible to unveil the actual solution but my own experience tells me that is not very likely to happen. Hugh Jack is good, better that he accustomed us, but Chritian Bale ruled. I'm not his biggest fan but the truth is there ain't a lot of actors doing better than him nowadays. The truth is that this movie actually has some historical accuracy. For example, Nikola Tesla did in fact experiment in Colorado Springs, building including the Magnifying Transmitter, shown in the movie. But I didn't like some aspects of the tricks, mostly about using impossible magic in this movie. It really works against the movie. In spite of that, this mystery thriller is one of the best I've seen. And yes it's true. You want to see it again the second it's over. 10/10"
" The Prestige (2006) - Are You Watching Closely?
",,"Christopher Nolan, the master of tricking the mind, comes back with his biggest hit since ""Memento"". ""The Prestige"" takes place in the Victorian era, where two rival magicians battle it out for each other's magic secrets, to create a more better magic trick, which will soon lead to serious consequences. The movie leads into unexpected moments, serious flashbacks, and edge-on-your-seat thrills. This film really tricked up my mind really well. There were many scenes in the movie that lead to twists and turns later on. Christopher Nolan is the only person that has a mind to trick the audience, and has a power to make a difficult puzzle of a movie that entertains audiences, and make them watch it over and over to understand the concept. The effects are glorious, the performances were superb, the music is dark, the film editing is super, the art direction is superb and the cinematography is golden. With a brilliant cast portrayed by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine, & David Bowie, a mind-bending script by the Nolan Brothers, and a powerful plot containing twists and turns, ""The Prestige"" is a marvelous Nolan masterpiece, and it never disappoints! ""The Prestige"", in my review, ""A mind-bending puzzle that's fun to watch again and again""."
" A story with many layers
",spoiler,"I saw this movie here in Brazil on cable TV, then I went to my DVD store, bought a copy and started to watch it again and again at home. This is simplely one of the finest movies that I saw in my whole life.Everything in the movie is perfect: Production, cast, soundtrack, etc, etc. But, besides that, the script is doing a lot more than to tell you the story of the magicians who are competing to be the ""best"". Actually, it seems to be inviting you, by metaphorical ways, to think and analyze the process of ideological construction and interpretation of our day-to-day reality. At the beginning and at the end, Michael Caine's character says ""you are not really looking, you want to be fooled"". Is he talking only about theather magic or algo talking about how we construct our vision of the world and our opinions about the most varied subjects? As a fellow user of this site said, there many layers in this movie to be analysed and discussed, and it is still a commercial movie, not some kind of experimental video done by college students. That, by itself, is an awesome achievement.The movie says that we want to be fooled, and that the magicians, in order to fool their audience, must be willing to deal with brutality and secrets. Aren't the magicians, in this movie, a representation of our parents, leaders, bosses, and those who have power and need to ideologically and morally justify themselves, in order to stay in power? The upper classes need to present their rule as just and natural, but they know that power can not be achieved and retained only by virtous manners. As Nicolai de Machiavelly pointed out centuries ago, you have to get your hands dirty in order to be a prince/a magician/to mistify, confuse, engage your audience/subjects and achieve your goals/perform your magic trick successfully.And the audience is us, the ordinary people who live their daily, working class lifes, willing to believe our bosses so we can sleep tonight. We want to be fooled."
" Amazing, all I can say.10/10 !
",,"This movie seems to get better every time I watch it, each little detail fits together so perfectly. It's impossible to fault, Nolan is a true genius. By far my favourite movie of all time,. Definitely deserves more than a sloppy 8.4 rating for such a magical piece, unfortunately it doesn't seem to take hold of everyone as strongly as it did me.Firstly the genre of the movie fitted perfectly to my liking, the movie was coated with a dark atmosphere, & the twist revolving around Borden was by far the best I've ever seen in a movie, i found the measures he took for what he loves doing to be inspiringIf i had to pick one imperfection from the movie, It would be the machine made by Tesla, although i felt it added a special touch to the movie, I can see how some people would say it was just an easy way to end it."
" Probably Nolan's and the decade's best.
",,"The Prestige - It is undoubtedly Nolan's best yet. Better than Dark Knight, better than Batman Begins and definitely better than Inception. It wouldn't be an understatement to say it is probably one of the most underrated movies of all time. All Nolan movies that followed have been exceptional but still won't be able to match The Prestige. The Prestige is an instant classic. It will leave you amazed and more importantly it will leave you wondering, why haven't you witnessed this masterpiece yet.The direction by Nolan is flawless, and so is the screenplay. The dialouges are honest with no hint of pretension. There is a unusual flow in the movie which helps Nolan switch from one story to another inter-wined story but still doesn't leave you confused. The movie from scene one is as gripping as it can get. And at the end of the odd 130 minutes, it doesn't end there. It stays with you.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are very believable as magicians and illusionists with an obsession to perform the greatest illusion. Michael Caine is very natural as usual. Even the supporting cast do justice to the script of the film. But what really makes The Prestige stand out is the script. Full credit to Christopher Priest on whose novel the movie is based as well as the Nolan brothers for the gripping screenplay. I have not read the novel but I don't think it can better than the movie. Imagining magic happen will never be the same as witnessing it. The standards set by Nolan in this one will be tough to match up even in the coming years. But you never know, what magic will this magician come up with. The magician called Christopher Nolan"
" Worth watching closely
",,"This movie is not for everybody; it is an exquisite mix of flashbacks and developments, more complex than Memento, but some viewers will find it confusing, complicated, or will see plot holes over the first half of the movie. The jumps in the time line are not an obstacle to character development, but help them as back stories; I got acquainted to the characters in The Prestige and actually cared about their struggles, their successes, and the deaths. Acting was very good overall, the environment was good and I felt in the 19th century. This is a recommended movie for intelligent people, ready to accept the twists and the moments of confusion in the midst of the story."
" Beautifully crafted film
",spoiler,"The Prestige begins like a camera completely out of focus. Nothing makes any sense. Nolan's film flips backwards and forwards through time like he's having a Memento flashback, characters wander across the screen talking about things we can't begin to understand. Locations appear, performances are had, and for a moment I thought I'd misread something and it was actually directed by David Lynch. Not so. Before long things start getting clearer. Bit by bit, everything comes into focus, a gradual process until by its end the film's brilliant, complete picture is crystal clear. To get there, you'll have to earn it. You'll have to hate it before you like it. During it's running time The Prestige will make you irritated, confused, exasperated, frustrated but before it's over... you'll fall in love with it. It's not just Nolan's best film; it's one of the best of the year. Unlike the lame-duck Illusionist, The Prestige is actually about magicians. The film ducks in and out of the lives of two rival performers, as they build their careers and trample over one another on their way to success in late 19th century London. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) start out together, working for a rival magician. Both aspire to a career in magic, but Angier refuses to get his hands dirty while Borden proclaims the only way to become a great magician is a path of total commitment. Things go wrong, they part as enemies. Angier holds a grudge against Borden and they go out in the world to make their fortune. Meanwhile Borden has an ace up his sleeve: an unbeatable trick. He walks in one door and out another across the room and calls it ""The Transported Man"". Unable to fathom how he's done it, the trick drives Angier completely mad. Their rivalry grows more vicious and desperate, with their magic skills used not only to wow audiences but wreak havoc on one another. None of it's really that simple. Telling you anything more though would be criminal. The movie unfolds as it should, with Chris and Jonathan Nolan's script teasing you along with glimpses of the future. Nothing is certain in this incredibly complex tale of rivalry, revenge, and misdirection. The film wraps itself in the world of magic, employing tricks of its own to lead the audience towards an incredibly conclusion. The cast is beyond compare. Jackman and Bale are supremely gripping as Angier and Borden, and my ass spent most of the movie on the edge of my seat simply waiting for the moments when they'd finally confront one another. Michael Caine is back as another crotchety mentor, but there's a reason for that. He's damned good at it. David Bowie shows up playing completely against type as Dr. Nikola Tesla assisted by the better than ever Andy Serkis. Scarlett Johansson and Piper Perabo play more minor roles in the film. They're assistants, so their job is to look incredibly hot. They're great at that. The movie's so packed with twists and turns that for some following it will prove impossible. What I'm saying here is that like Nolan's first noteworthy film Memento, The Prestige isn't interested in pandering. This is incredibly high level storytelling, in fact there's a good chance it'll go right over some people's heads. This is Memento era Nolan back from the grave. This isn't the director of big Hollywood films like Batman Begins and Insomnia. This is the guy who made a movie from the perspective of a man with a five second memory, and then managed to make it better by showing the damn thing upside down and in reverse. This time he's taken his gift for the tangled and dense, and topped himself. It's completely absorbing. Don't blame the movie if it flies over audiences heads, what Nolan's done here is a masterpiece of entertainment and art."
" Absolutely amazing film
",,"In my opinion this is probably the greatest film I have ever seen, an awesome cast at the peak of their performances. Christian Bale is often referred to as a 'wooden' or 'emotionless' actor, but I blame this on the fact that for a great deal of his films he has to put on an American accent, but during his performance in this film he sticks to a British accent, it may not be his natural one, but it seems to open him up to new emotions that he cannot portray with an American accent. Hugh Jackman is also sometimes ridiculed for his acting, but for this film he doesn't play the mindless, anger-driven wolverine which I feel limited his acting performances, as all he had to do was flex his muscles and shout, but again, this film shows his true potential as an actor and it is truly astonishing. Michael Caine... Well there's nothing to say, you can't go wrong with Michael Caine. Scarlett Johanson, despite being a fairly minor character, was actually quite impressive, particularly with her accent which was spot on, though I felt her character was a bit pointless (other than to keep the gents happy obviously) but that would be a problem I have with the book itself rather than the film adaptation. All of these brilliant actors, each of which I would say providing the best performances of their careers so far, coupled with Christopher Nolan, a director who seems to be able to turn anything into an amazing film, make this film a truly amazing experience, and believe me, you will want to watch it again. 10/10 - my favourite film"
" Are you watching closely?
",,"Chris Nolan does it again, he keeps churning out incredible films one after another. The Prestige is no exception. The first line of the film is by far the most important line, ""Are you watching closely?"". The first time I saw this movie, I thought it was only a good movie, maybe a 7/10... but after seeing it a few more times, I was amazed at what I had missed. Christian Bale had another outstanding performance alongside Michael Caine and Nolan (They're quite the team). And Hugh Jackman delivers what could be his best performance yet. Even David Bowie was quite good! I highly recommend this film to anyone and everyone, but make sure you watch it closely!!!"
" No Hell March
",,"I haven't read the novel; for a brief and concise list of differences, see the FAQ(and it contains spoilers, obviously; this review doesn't). The Nolans strike again with their very favorite subject; obsession. I won't make a crack about how they can't let that go. This and its ad campaign asks you to ""watch closely"", and frankly, it's because of me doing that that I figured out nearly every major twist. I'm not bragging; I honestly wish that there had been more surprises left. No, I'm warning you to not try to figure the secrets of this out before they are revealed to you, or at least not too hard. I also do agree with Ebert's complaint that they cheated in this. With that said, this is engaging, interesting and compelling from start to finish. The plot is marvelous, and this is well-paced. This is psychologically deep and accurate. The acting is amazing. This has a non-linear time-line, and utilizes it well. The story is fairly complicated, and you do need to pay attention. Script and dialog are well-written. This has fun moments, and the tone isn't all dark. Johansson looks incredibly hot as usual, and this does have some(albeit well-integrated and natural-seeming) eye-candy for males. There is a bit of bloody violence, a little mild to moderate language and plenty of disturbing content in this. The DVD contains a handful of short, informative featurettes, four photo galleries and a theatrical trailer. I recommend this to any fan of the director or anyone else who helped put this together. 10/10"
" The Ultimate Trick!
",,"I had seen this film when it first came out and remembered liking it very much. Now, years later I decided to give it a rewatch, I can definitely say this- what an amazing film. The screenplay is strong, very mysterious and always keeps the audience second-guessing everything. The film is like a never ending maze. It has so many twists and turns, so many layers to it. Christopher Nolan really is a genius. I have considered his finest works Memento and The Dark Knight, but I can say this holds up to those films pretty much in every way. His direction is masterful and elegant. The performances are great, and the tragic rivalry between Angier and Borden and it's outcomes certainly are a great character study for each men. For me, I started with my own view of each character, and thought Angier was in the right from the start. However, as the film goes along, the film itself forces you to change sides and change your whole perspective on the characters. I thought this was really amazing and rarely does a film make you do that. Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson are very good, especially the former. Having seen her here and in Vicky Cristina Barcelona, she seems to be a great actress, and in each film she has outshined the still-talented Johansson. Having seen The Illusionist, I can say this is on a whole other level. The Illusionist was good, but entirely different besides the magician perspective. The Prestige is a perfect example of why we see films. We want to be entertained, we want to be mesmerized, and we want to be tricked and enchanted by the whole world a film brings you into. The Prestige is the ultimate trick!"
" A good movie,maybe even great but still very overrated!
",,"Prestige is a great movie.Christopher Nolan once more proved him self to be a great director.The acting is also very good an the best thing about it is probably the screenplay.However this movie most definitely doesn't deserves to be on eighty third place on 250 best movies ever made list.There are probably a hundred to two hundred movies that are better than this one.How can Prestige be better then The Deer Hunter or The Gladiator or Braveheart or Dances With Wolves or Meet Joe Black which is one of the most underrated movies of all time.There are also 2001: A Space Odyssey,Once Upon a Time in America,Full Metal Jacket,The Sting,Sin City,The Green Mile,Ben-Hur,Gone with the Wind,Gandhi,Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels,Mystic River,Good Will Hunting,Rocky and many,many other's.I can't really say anything bad about The Prestige except that it's overrated.Maybe it's not even overrated,i just think that there are definitely more than eighty movies that are better then this one.And even though it's a very intelligent,tensed and surprising movie that's not predictable,not one bit,i still think that it shouldn't be on the eighty third place! Sorry,i just don't! However,all i all,It's a good movie that you will surely enjoy watching.You will probably watch it more than once as i did.But still don't expect it to be the best movie you've ever seen cause it's definitely not.Enjoy!!!"
" Amazing film!! One of the best of the decade!!
",,"I've seen some movies that try to blow your mind, I've seen some movies that try to challenge you and make you believe in the unimaginable. The Prestige does both, it challenges you while making you think you know what is going on and just when you have it all figured out it throws a Monkey wrench into your plans and leaves you totally baffled and dumbfounded even after the ending, so the real question is what is true in this film? and what is a lie? The Prestige Is brilliant, taunt, dark, sinister, sadistic, malicious, vicious need I go on? It's a film that you can revile in and admire for it's complex nature and dark themes. It's one of the most convincing and thought provoking period pieces I've ever seen since Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan. It enters your mind and slowly but surely starts to poke at your brain and make you think what you know and believe is nothing but an elaborate hoax, a smoke screen to blind you from the truth that is buried underneath the complexity of this film it brings out the first basic law of life. Kill or be killed. And this film takes that meaning to a whole new extreme it uses treachery, betrayal, murder and deception to fully tell and improve the main basis of the plot and to bring out the dark nature that revenge has on a man's soul. All in all this film is nothing short of a brilliant and taunt masterpiece.Hugh Jackman(who finally makes a great film outside of X-Men.) Brings his acting to whole other world, he pulls no stops to be cruel and vicious. He brings a great darkness the likes we have never seen and an obsessive nature like on other. Christian Bale(Who in my opinion stole the show.) Is another who rocks the house in this film, he brings a more sadistic side than Jackman and really almost out classes him in this film. Bale really steps up his game and brings a whole new level of obsessive rivalry to this movie. But all in all the whole cast does magnificently in this handsomely mounted film.The Prestige is not your average film, it requires strict and complete attention to truly grasp and understand the story and plot. Kind of like The Matrix if you sneeze you will lose what is going on in the film, it's that complex. But when you get to understand it and know it it really is a truly magnificent film and a really treat to watch on screen. But I have just one request if you watch this movie, watch very closely because nothing in this film is what it really seems."
" Slow pace compensated with great cinematography and a unique third act.
",spoiler,"Throughout the first act we discover that the narrator had been deliberately misleading us. The same thing happens throughout the second act. Using the concept of magic tricks, we may think of those first two acts as 'the pledge' and 'the turn.' Everything is cruelly revealed with the third act, 'the prestige,' and a bleak, ungodly finale. Angier is severely punished, while Borden brutally destroys every single hope he had ever had.Bale did not do a good job; all monotonous, even in his supposedly highly emotional master scenes, which leaves one bedazzled, unable to classify the actor when compared to some decent performances in The Machinist and even a few scenes in Equilibrium, while having dreadful appearances in The Batman new releases for instance.Johansson is a superfluous eye-candy, perhaps due to an unbalanced character. Caine reprises Paul Giamatti's Inspector Uhl's character from The Illusionist (2006) (they even have a very similar visage, which also goes for Johansson and Jessica Biel's appearances to some degree.) Bowie was captivating as the famous Nikola Tesla.Jackman was the undisputed star, missing only in one line where he cites, ""I don't care about my wife,"" which is supposed to be an excuse not to sympathize with him, but that is, perhaps, a matter of paperwork after all.This is a very intriguing adaptation that deserves being watched again and again."
" Batman and Alfred (outside Gotham) meet Wolverine
",,"In between the Batman movies, Christopher Nolan cast Christian Bale and Michael Caine in ""The Prestige"". It tells the story of magicians Alfred Borden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Initially partners, they had a falling out and became rivals. From there the movie becomes a battle of wits, showing how the men have no aim except to destroy the other. Caine plays John Cutter, the state engineer who works for Angier.I notice similarities between this movie and some of Nolan's others. There's the non-linear plot, like ""Memento""; one-upmanship, like ""Insomnia""; the question of morality, like in ""The Dark Knight"". But what impressed me more than anything was all the stuff about magic tricks, how the characters use the tricks against each other, and how they both use Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson). Angier's and Borden's rivalry mirrors Nikola Tesla's (David Bowie) rivalry with Thomas Edison.All in all, I recommend this movie. It's both a look into the world of magic tricks, and also the dangers of obsession with revenge. Also starring Andy Serkis (Gollum in the LOTR movies) and Ricky Jay (a real-life magician).PS: other 2006 movies dealing with magic tricks are ""The Illusionist"" and ""Scoop"" (also starring Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson)."
" The PERFECT Nolan movie !!!
",,"I am a Nolan fan, i am looking forward to his new movies. I think Memento, The Prestige and The Dark Knight are the best movies I have ever seen. This man knows how to create a masterpiece! He has specific characteristics, like Burton and Shyamalan. You like their movies or not, generally you can tell ""This is a .... movie!"" as soon as you see a movie of them.In my opinion, some directors want to reveal themselves, their characteristics in a movie. I think Shyamalan's Lady in The Water and Nolan's Prestige are such movies. I see Nolan as a magician. You can see all the pledge, the turn and the prestige in all of his movies. The best part of his movies is that you cannot see the trick easily. You can watch the movie again and again, and you may still see new points. You may still change your mind about the truth, about ""the trick"" or you may just be lost in surrealism, in a multi-dimensional truth. You may just see what you want to see and you can never get what was Nolan brothers thinking, just like a poem."
" AWESOME - should be higher than 8.4
",spoiler,"as i said this film is truly awesome, a piece of modern film 'magic' again by chris nolan. i wont go into all the twists and turns and change in eras as other comments have, but will just say the film leaves you feeling more entertained than many blockbuster films that rely on cgi have ever done, and also duped by all the subtle hints that are dropped throughout the film that we don't notice. I have just finished watching the movie for what must be 10-15th time, and still find these bits funny when i see them as some are so obvious,but at the same time woven into the story beautifully, and i am still also finding parts that open up more discussion!! One of the greatest films ever crafted, just as good as batman begins and the dark knight!!"
" It's Good
",,"In my motel room the other night I caught this on the movie channel. Here's my thoughts.""The Prestige"" is kind of like ""The Illusionist"", only a bit different. It is built upon the story of two rising magicians- Alfred (Bale) and Robert (Jackman) who soon become bitter rivals after Alfred seemingly kills his girlfriend on purpose (that would do it for me). They become engrossed in a a game of ""can you top this"" with no rules, causing a lot of tragedy and pain along the way. Near the end of the movie it seems Robert, who has generally been the follower and not the leader, finally pulls of a stunt that blows Alfred's mind. Has Robert finally outdone his foe? See it to find out.A gripping story, with plenty of action and a lot for the audience to try to work out. The main stars are excellent, brilliantly supported by Michael Caine, and not so much by Scarlett Johansson. One of the better movies of the millennium."
" They Want to Be Fooled
",,"This film is, on the surface, a story concerning rival magicians in Victorian London. But, at the heart of things, it is really a film about film-making. As far as I'm concerned, the goal of any film is threefold. I call it the 3 Es: Engage, Entertain, and Enlighten. Before either of the later two can happen, the audience must first be engaged. This means giving them a point of reference; that is to say, introduce them to something familiar right off the bat: a character that is relatable, and a situation or conflict that is easily comprehended. Once the audience is engaged, it is the filmmaker's duty to then entertain them, by putting the established characters in humorous or nerve-racking situations. There is a certain flare for creating truly entertaining scenes that only a few select directors possess. There is a kind of showmanship quality to film-making. The final thing a film must do is enlighten the audience. That is, the film should come to a point that stimulates the mind of the viewer. This is not always achieved and is even more difficult to pull off than pure entertainment. This third aspect is what separates great films from those that are simply good. It helps the film stick in people's minds long after they have seen it.The above three elements of the film viewing experience are directly comparable to the three stages of a magic trick, as discussed in ""The Prestige"". These are The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige. The Turn is when the audience is shown something ordinary; a handkerchief or a small bird. This is much like the beginning of a film when the audience is engaged by something equally familiar. The second part is The Turn, when the ordinary thing is made to do something extraordinary, like disappear. ""But,"" as Michael Caine's character says in the the film, ""you wouldn't clap yet. It's not enough to make something disappear. You have to bring it back."" This seemingly miraculous return of the vanished object is The Prestige, and it is the most important part of the trick. These latter two parts are similar to the way entertaining the audience can bring them to something enlightening; how a heart pounding chase scene can wind and twist and turn, and then deposit us at some great, profound truth. Another convention of magic tricks that is shared in film-making is the suspension of disbelief. It is said in the film that the audience knows that it is only an illusion, but they don't want to know how it is accomplished. ""They want to be fooled"", as they say. This is equally true with the film viewing experience. Any individual of even average intelligence knows full well that what they are witnessing on screen is not entirely real, but they ignore that fact. They want something extraordinary. They want to see something aside from their familiar reality. They want to escape, and it is the job of both the magician and the filmmaker to render a believable fantasy for the viewing public. Filmmakers are the magicians of their day. With both magic and cinema, people go to the theater to see something outside of their own, regular experience. They are, at first, presented with something against which they can compare their own lives. ""I know what this is. I get this"", they think to themselves. Then, through this relatable proxy, the audience is taken on a journey into previously unknown territory, where they witness things they had never imagined and certainly did not expect. Then, at the end of this voyage, and indeed because of it, we come to a profundity that we had not known, yet it is undeniably true. We leave the theater having gained a fuller experience. Or course we know it was all smoke and mirrors, but to dwell on this notion would ruin something very special."
" A Masterpiece in Contemporary Cinema
",,"I have no words, how much I liked this movie. In short, its one of the ten best among that released after 2000. But this is my conservative approach. Actually its among the all the time. The story was not a story. It was reflection of different human natures shown flawlessly through competition between two magicians - played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. The movie has several twists backed by logical sense that kept the interest alive for 2 hour length. The ending blew me away. I was shocked when secret of Christian Bale revealed in the end. On the technical side, art direction and camera work was stand out. Locations were so real, one could actually feel. On side role, Scarlett Johansson confidently played Magician's helper. She is hauntingly beautiful. Her little presence was noticeable.Director Christopher Nolan is the next big thing after Spielberg, Eastwood, Scorsese, Lucas and Allen. He has developed a new genre of cinema - Intelligence + Entertainment. I am not surprised by the fact his three films are in IMDb Top 250."
" Are you watching closely?
",,"Christopher Nolan takes on a Sci-Fi film with a touch of magic as he directs ""The Prestige"". An impressive cast star in it with Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale in the leads; and Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie supporting as the film plays with the viewer's mind more than any movie has since Nolan's ""Memento"". The use of normal linear plot setting along with flashbacks and flashbacks in flashbacks are what help to accomplish such a perplexing work of genius.Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are rival magicians in an end-of-the-nineteenth-century London. Borden develops a new trick which frustrates Angier and compels him to do things which are almost inconceivable to find out his secret. Cutter (Caine), Angier's illusion creator, insists that Borden uses a double where Borden goes in through one door and the double comes out the other; much to Angier's disbelief, he vows to find out Borden's method and use it to improve his own act.""The Prestige"" is yet another astonishing and remarkable film from the fantastically skillful Christopher Nolan which propels the viewer on a ride through the dark hearts of two men. A solid film from a solid director with a solid cast is reason enough to check this masterpiece out. Upon, multiple viewings the film unravels more and more to reveal its true genius inside and out, highly recommended."
" Awful !!!
",,"The movie lacks understanding. the characters are though jumbling from one scene to another but, unable to reach the conclusion. Hugh Jackman knows that Christian Bale is onlooking the task of stealing magic, but still he clarifies in the movie that he is the only one who can perform better magic. But at last he dies and Bale thinks he is alive. in the end Bale is only the survivor who lives and Hugh Jackman dies, but, in the actual view Bale is original villain who kills Jackman's wife and finds himself against Jackman. the story line is quite boring and if there are certain philosophical remakes in the movie, they are hidden and everyone thinks that performing magic is real task and prolongs killings. Michael Kane is the real idiot in the movie who goes around the stage and clarifies with the audience that Bale and Jackman are the only magicians who know how to perform magic."
" My Favorite Film Of All Time.
",,"The Prestige, is a film about love, friendship, rivalry, competition, and magic. The film is Christian Bale (Borden) and Hugh Jackman (Angier) who are friends and become enemies as they compete with each other for a number of reasons.Christopher Nolan, the director is perfect for this film, he creates an atmosphere perfect for every scene, will his leads act throughout this atmosphere like it's their own creation. Wally Pfister, director of cinematography should have won an Oscar for this, exaggeration? Watch the film yourself.I can guarantee that you will love this film. Sit down with a plate of nachos, and watch. A brilliant film, which will consume you, and make you want to watch it over and over again.Are you watching closely?"
" An entertaining movie. If you like a little illusion and a good twist, you'll enjoy this.
",,"An entertaining movie. The first half only became truly interesting after you were already into the second half, but over all a movie definitely worth seeing. The acting was excellent, Bale and Jackman are marvelous rivals who are different enough, opposite enough, to make you root for one and then the other in the blink of an eye. The effects were very entertaining as was the 'magic'. There was just enough hinting at 'something more' to keep you guessing the entire time, which makes it a lot of fun to watch. And even if you didn't like anything else about this movie, the ending alone was reason enough to watch it. Amazing.If you like a little illusion and a good twist, you'll enjoy this."
" Dark and brilliant
",,"For some reason I decided not to see this in the cinema and now I am really annoyed that I didn't. This is a brilliant film. Beautifully paced, complex and dark.One of the reasons that I didn't go see it in the cinema is that I'm not a big fan of magic or steam punk but what this film is really about is the art and mind of the illusionist.The twist in the story keeps itself hidden right to the end. The storyline despite being complex is wonderfully coherent as well. There are no unnecessary scenes in the whole film. It's very reminiscent of Fight Club in some ways.I'd highly recommend this film to everyone."
" Mind-boggling philosophical exploration of illusion and real magic
",,"Intriguing, wondrous exploration of illusions and science/magic, with much to leave the viewer thinking for quite a while after the end. Beautifully done--writing, acting, directing, design--all transport us to a fictional previous time and place.Very philosophical, yet enjoyable for those who just want to experience a good story.I only wish I'd seen this in a theater instead of on DVD. If it is ever re-released, be sure to see it on the big screen. I will. This is one film that almost requires repeat viewings to fully appreciate the nuances."
" Worth a watch but be prepared to feel deflated
",spoiler,"I'm a huge Nolan fan but I thought 'The Prestige' was a little disappointing for two main reasons: 1) Tesla's invention is so far fetched and impossible that I just couldn't believe the story.2) The story relied too much on the twist at the end. It's not gratifying to watch a film just to find out you've been essentially lied to for the past 2 hours.You know that feeling when a magician reveals the secret to their trick? Normally you feel deflated, cheated and disappointed. That's how I felt at the end of 'The Prestige'.Still, I think Nolan is the smartest writer and director today, he dropped the ball with 'The Prestige'"
" Wizard of Oz is nothing compared to Christopher Nolan
",,"The prestige is about two rivaling magicians in London during the turn of the century. Nolan accomplished a unique, not to say magical movie. From the actors and their performances to the dialogs to the background music...everything is presented in a magical way. Every great movie consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge: The movie shows you something ordinary, but of course it isn't. The second act is called The Turn: The movie makes his ordinary something do something extraordinary. Now, if you're looking for the secret you won't find it. That's why there's a third act, called The Prestige. This is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before. You have just seen The Prestige! :)"
" Absolutely engrossing.
",,"The Prestige is a rare film in its own right for the simple fact that it completely engrosses the audience into the story for nearly the entire 130 minute running time and refuses to let go until the finale is revealed. What starts out simple enough turns into a story so complex and layered, it requires multiple viewings to catch everything. First off, the acting must be convincing to keep the audience paying attention, which it pulls off tremendously. Hugh Jackman carries his role very well, Michael Caine is a pleasure to watch, and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansson also hold their own. The best performance, though, is that of Christian Bale, who also plays the most volatile and eccentric character. Every scene he is in he dominates and it is pretty difficult to pay attention to anything but him.As the story unfolds, we find out a rivalry has come between Jackman and Bale, and they continue to sneak into each other's shows as well as pull dirty tricks in order to learn the other's secrets and ruin him. This is the bulk of the film, and the last 20-30 minutes try and bring everything to light. Many fans have argued that this film cheats with its climax and that director/co-writer Christoper Nolan does this to duck out of anything to complicated or difficult. Those who do, however, are looking at it all wrong. Nolan gives us even more questions after the film concludes, and it takes multiple viewings to understand all the interactions and motivations of each character. Even after you may understand what actually occurred in the story, questions will still raise in your mind about the clarity and realism of these conclusions.In short, this is a near-masterpiece from one of the most talented directors this generation. Nolan is working with incredible powers of the cinema here. The entire plot is told completely out of order, yet it is never confusing or convoluted. Everything here holds up, and while questions certainly will be raised about the nature of the story, no one can doubt the undeniable storytelling ability of Christopher Nolan. It is mostly for entertainment, but it also shows what bitter hatred and obsession with revenge can do to a man. This is truly film making at its finest art form."
" Simply magical
",,"""The Prestige"" tells the story of a pair of magicians in turn of the century London. A bitter rivalry develops between the two and it seems that they will stop at nothing to top each other, perhaps even resorting to murder.The story is a fine one; full of the film equivalent of slight of hand and with enough depth to make a second viewing as rewarding as the first. The film basically plays like one big magic trick though it has enough variety to keep things interesting throughout.The stars, Christian Bale & Hugh Jackman, are convincing in their roles, bringing the magicians (and their explosive rivalry) to life. The supporting cast is pretty good as well, though there were no real standouts as far as I was concerned (except for the always notable Michael Caine).Christopher Nolan added to an already impressive resume with his director's (and co-writer's) credit here. However, while his work here is accomplished, I remain of the opinion that his reputation is based more upon a shrewd choice in projects than a particular talent for direction.Finally, given the subject matter, this film is bound to draw comparisons to ""The Illusionist"". While that film is pretty good, I believe that this film is superior in every way."
" Extraordinary!!!
",,"According to the dictionary, the prestige means: ""reputation or influence arising from success, achievement, rank, or other favorable attributes"". The prestige is what Hugh Jackman, Micheal Caine, Christian Bale and Christopher Nolan have for making such a good movie. The plot is extraordinary. Just like any magic act, the story also has three parts. In the 'Pledge', we are introduced to the two magicians, competing against each other for the better act. On one hand there is Angier, who loves his wife and believes it is showmanship that makes an act great. On the other hand we have Borden who believes you need to make sacrifices and live your act, not just perform it, to make it great. In the 'Turn', Bordon accidentally kills Angier's wife and Angier wants revenge. The competition between the two starts getting dirty, each one trying to sabotage the other's act. Then Bordon comes up with 'the transported man'. Angier is unable to replicate this act and becomes desperate to find Bordon's secret. Both men in their constant effort to best each other end up destroying their family and their lives. The 'Prestige' is truly the Coup de grace of the movie where the secrets and sacrifices of the two magicians are revealed and everything beautifully but shockingly falls into place.The movie is a tale of obsession, love, sacrifice, misdirection, revenge and 'getting your hands dirty'. Maybe I haven't seen a lot of movies but The Prestige gave me what I had never seen before. Do watch it."
" misdirection at it's finest
",,"The 2000's has not been a great movie decade. This movie will be one of the 10 best unless 09 really shines. Not a dull moment, not a line ignored, strong performances from a great cast, and in the final moment, you realize you were missing the obvious for the whole movie. The music set the mood for every light and dark moment, the lighting was superb, as mentioned on the disk, a lot of earth colors that make the moments seem calm, but still surrealistic.And finally the photography, made the magic seem even more real. You will not find many movies of this decade that were better, come to think of it, you will not find a lot of movies ever that will top this excellent film."
" The big revelation is a big let down
",,"""The Prestige"" is a very well crafted movie. The camera work, the lighting, the set decoration, the costumes and the acting for the most part are very well done. The way it flashback and flash forward yet maintains its cohesiveness and and build suspense is a testimony to Christopher Nolan as a film director and to his editor. Despite all this the big surprise the audience is hoping for is pretty much revealed to anyone closely paying attention with about 50 minutes left in the movie.The film is about a couple of magicians who were co-apprentices when they were young, until a tragedy set off a bitter rivalry. The rivalry reach a climax as they try to out do each other with a trick called the teleported man. The quest for the answer sets the audience for a promise of big surprises yet in the end what we get is something so obvious and yet another one that is so far fetched that it stretches one's suspension of disbelief.To me the only surprise is what happened to the Hugh Jackman character in the end. It's what happened to him in the beginning that created the bitterness among the two friends. And the Christian Bale character was in no way at all likable. But I suppose it's appropriate because it's when we realize that the movie is no longer about the revenge but about the egos of the magicians/showman. They are not just trying to awe their audience but also to one up each other. They want to come up with one trick that will make their fellow magicians envious.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale gave very good performances, Michael Caine is wonderful as always playing an older magician who guides Jackman. Scarlett Johannson did a decent job although her English accent seem to change, very early on it was as cockney as Mr. Caine's but later on it sounded more upper class. David Bowie was a bit of a surprise as real life scientist Nikola Tesla. I didn't recognize him at first.Over all I would say that as a period piece and a character study of magicians it was well done but it's main failing is the big promise and the big revelations of the teleported man, one was obvious and the other was ridiculous."
" Brilliantly conceived and executed
",,"The Prestige is a tale of bitter revenge between two rival magicians during the end of the 19th century. The film is set largely in a bleak London which helps to portray the true grubby nature of the obsessions that begin to envelop the two young magicians played magnificently by Hugh Jackman (Angier) and Christian Bale (Borden).The story is truly engrossing; the nature of the magician and the compulsion of Angier and Borden to constantly outdo the other provide the perfect ammunition to twist and weave the plot without slipping into the realms of the implausible. Illusion is the order of the day and the constant frustration of both Angier and Borden as they try to discover the truths behind (and sabotage) each other's tricks is palpable.Michael Caine as Cutter  Angier's friend and career aide  puts in a stellar performance as do Rebecca Hall (Julia) and Scarlett Johansson (Olivia) as the two love interests (although their screen-time is minimal). David Bowie (Tesla) is fantastic as the scientist visited by Angier in the hope of discovering and besting Borden's greatest trick: the transporting man. It is this particular trick that is the focal point of a cinematic climax that will be remembered (and applauded) for a long time.The last time a film left my head spinning as much as this was after watching The Shawshank Redemption for the first time, and I cannot give any higher praise then that.Christopher Nolan does an excellent job of enlightening us to the ins and outs of the magician's industry at the turn of the century (where stage entertainment was a massive money-spinner) whilst still leaving an element of wonder and mysticism. The portrayal of these two men as solely committed to their magic (at the expense of all else) is brilliantly conceived. The film is shot beautifully and the direction is spot-on considering the difficult era being portrayed.There is only one slight word of caution: the film is cut very tightly and jumps from the perspective of both Angier and Borden through two time threads, often too swiftly. This isn't a criticism as such, merely a warning to those that don't like non-linear story telling as it could become confusing.Overall a brilliant piece of work that will please and delight almost any audience."
" Smart entertainment. Simply genius.
",,"""Prestige"" is pure entertainment, what can i say? it's just amazing! i loved every second of it, and I've recommended it to my family and friends, and i didn't shut up until everyone i knew had seen it.everyone liked it. why? this movie is visually amazing, the natural light is very well managed, and the movie has a ""not hard to look at"" Gothic thing going on.the movie is all about story, story, story. twists, twists, twists. But attention, there are smart twist! and this is very unusual, because American movies rarely have good twists, and this movie has a lot of good ones.In the end, is pure entertainment, but it's something new: Smart Entertainment. Everyone will love it. It's simply genius, simply delicious."
" It Was a Dark and Stormy Film
",,"The Prestige"" is a dark and stormy film, about two rival magicians, Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden. Angier's wife dies in a dangerous escape illusion. Borden tied the knot around her wrists, but he says he's not sure whether he tied an easy-to-escape slipknot, or much trickier one.Angier seeks revenge, and afterward Borden seeks revenge in turn. Who gets the final revenge? Unless you are paying very careful attention, you won't know even after watching it to the end.All the magicians are obsessed with the craft of magic, but one is slightly less crazy. And the chances are you won't be sure which is which until the end of the film.This plot is so rich that you should see the film again to understand the nuances you missed the first time.After you have seen the film, you can consider reading my second comment, which has spoilers intended to help you understand what's going on.One thing: I sometimes had trouble telling Angier and Borden apart. To help you: Depending on where in the story you are, Angier has a standard middle-American or an upper-class ""King's English: accent. Borden has a lower-class English accent. Also, each of them sabotages the other's tricks at least once. After that, Borden wears gloves to cover his damaged hand, and Angier limps."
" Now, watch closely!
",,"This was a delightfully twisted film. As others have said, the mood, acting, staging and script are all right on. The characters are strikingly real, although it would have been so easy to make them just stage characters; even when their behavior is temporarily hard to understand, it is also hard to disbelieve. Where it really excels, however, is inserting an element of science fiction with the other ""magic"" so smoothly that it does not seem out of place. Most people with whom I have watched the film entirely failed to notice more than one significant plot element, not because what was happening was concealed, but because - well, after all, it's illusion, isn't it? Throughout, and especially by the time you get to the end, you don't expect to really understand. Only when you really think about it and discuss it afterward do you realize that within its own terms, it all hangs together beautifully.Sometimes a film is so complex and confusing so that people walk out saying ""I don't think I get it""; but rarely do they also say ""I want to see it again."" The Sixth Sense was an exception; this one is even more so."
" A masterpiece!!!!
",,"After taking a long break from magic related movies in Hollywood; cinema-goers were struck by this movie and the respect it so-obviously demanded. Throughout the movie one cant help but to be attracted to its underlined sense of mystery and the urge to unfold the secret of the magic tool to which we are introduced, in the beginning of the film. With astonishing performances by both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, i would would gladly gives two thumbs up to this motion picture. However, some may claim that the strong resemblance to the movie 'The Illusionist' may have stolen some its charm, seeing as both movies were released at around the same time."
" Very good, but failed to touch me somehow
",spoiler,"very well shot, interesting story and even touches some very interesting questions about being humanstill it somehow failed to touch my hearth ...maybe because you just can't start to care about any of the characters ... they are all quite dislikable, each mad in his own way ... well, this is the way it has to be to show us those dark spots of us all i guess ...the movie manages to end without the much preferred Hollywood happy ending, at least for me and this i find quite positive. some may argue that at least the child and the father (if this was the father) stay alive and the others get what they deserve, but ... do they really and is the guy who stays alive the one who tied Angiers wife? and didn't both twins drive their own wife into suiciding?i for my part would love to see them all dead ... maybe in some twisted manner like From Dusk Till DOwn - all the audience turns into vampires and kills them all ;)having complained a bit i still must admit this to be a very good movie. it finally convinced me that Hugh Jackman is a really good actor, also i love David Bowies character and the story has enough twists to keep you awake""Robert Angier: Price is not an object. Nikola Tesla: Yes, but have you considered the *cost*?"""
" A brilliant film. Great performances mixed with a great story
",,"I was blown away by The Prestige. I don't know what exactly it was about it. Perhaps it was the incredible performances from Bale, Jackman, Caine, and Johansson. Perhaps it was the well thought out, near perfect script. Or perhaps it was the freshness this film brings to the eyes when first viewed, the same eyes that have seen crap after crap released in theaters. I don't know what it was for me but I must admit I was blown away by The Prestige and I have watched it several more times since first seeing it in theaters that October evening.The story follows aspiring magicians Angier and Borden as they struggle to both make names for themselves and to have the greatest 'prestige' in London. After a tragic accident, Borden and Angier become enemies. Soon a potentially dangerous rivalry develops between the two as both try to discover the ultimate illusion. What follows is a duel story line set in the past, following the reasons for the rivalry, and a present which follows the adventure of Angier as he tries to match Borden. Both stories are intriguing and will suck the audience in as they rotate screen time.As stated above four actors give great performances. Christian Bale (Batman Begins) gives one of the best performances of his career and that is certainly saying something. Bale plays the troubled and laid back Borden who is the cause of a terrible accident that causes the rift between him and Angier. Bale gives a very strong performance. He brings depth and sympathy to the character of Borden which I felt was strongly needed. Bale made out Borden to be exactly what he needed to be, a troubled individual who regrets most things in his life. Hugh Jackman (X-Men) also gives a tremendous performance as Borden's rival Angier. I never thought Jackman much of an actor, especially after seeing Van Helsing, however, he proved me wrong in this. Angier at first is made out to be a good hearted individual with a few flaws but none to serious. Angier goes through a major transformation that I feel few actors could have pulled off. Jackman was able to pull it off and give one of the best performances of his career.In support are the legendary Michael Caine and the beautiful Scarlet Johansson. Both give very strong performances and help the movie be even better. Caine plays the stage director and sort of mentor to Angier. Johansson plays Angier's stage hand and Borden's lover. Both are exceptional actors who gives exceptional performances in their respected roles. Not too much screen time is given to either which is good. I had a bad feeling these two would some how end up in every scene but thankfully that was not the case.The story is easy enough to follow... at first. A major twist is around every corner and will keep the audience guessing until the last lines are spoken. The twist isn't so out of nowhere that everyone will be wondering what the hell just happened. Most people will see things they missed earlier when the twists in the film do occur. The plot is well thought out and flows nicely. There are no dry moments of pointless dialog. Everything is important and needed to make the film work. Overall the film is one of the best written I have seen in a long time. A long time.In my opinion it is one of the best films of 2006 if not the new millennium. The plot is great. The cast is among the best compiled group of actors one could find in one film. The acting those people do is marvelous. Everything looks and feels real and will never have an audience member questioning what is happening on screen. This is key as when a person starts to question things on the screen, the film begins to lose its magical touch. This does not happen once throughout the course of The Prestige.5/5 stars"
" The Prestige is Simply Magical!!!
",spoiler,"This is probably one of the best movies I have ever watched with a great cast, awesome plot, and spectacular production set. Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are superb in their respective roles as rival magicians in Victorian-era London. I actually had to watch it twice on certain mysterious scenes in order to get the surprise ending. The best part is that there is a sub-plot regarding Nikolos Telsa, the ""Father of Electromagnetism and electrical AC current"", and Thomas Edison on who is the best inventor in the field of electromagnetism. The sub-plot will give the basis on the competition between Jackman and Bale's characters in this movie. I would look for various clues throughout the movie in order to understand the finale."
" Simply Amazing
",,This has got to be one of the most amazing films i have ever seen.truly...fantastic..exuberant...best place to be ever.It was recommended to me by friends but i never listened until one lonely night in which i said to myself..i have to go see it..and i did: the result is i was dazed..and still am..a great story acted almost without flaws..accents and lust.Kane was just outstanding...his way of narrating the story kept me so close to it that i was living it by the end.I am the spectator that wants to see behind the stage..that will search for answers...Go see it if u haven't so far ! Fantastic !
" Stunning Simply Stunning! AGAIN!
",spoiler,"Which I'm going to get straight to the point and say... IS ONE OF THE GREATEST FILMS I'VE EVER SEEN OR MADE! Right now that's out the way... why? The acting is what I would call simply stunning, prefect in fact with Hugh Jackson and Christian Bale giving there best performance (apart from maybe Bale in The Machinest)... with a stunning supporting cast including Bowie who is superb in his cameo role. The story is although a little complicated, brilliant... and keeps you guessing right until the end and holds your interest for a solid 2 hours....I can't praise this film enough... and for once... a Victorial London for the first time in any film I've watched looked Victorian and not like a BBC Drama... it's gritting, dirty, beautifully filmed throughout... and to be honest, although a different film to The Illusionist I watched with Edward Norton, it makes that film look like Blue Peter...This is the BEST FILM I'VE SEEN SINCE GLADIATOR and I think this has just jumped straight into my top 10 films ever made. STUNNING Pug"
" fascinating, impressive and extraordinary
",,"Honestly i can say that, the Prestige engraves claps. The story is fascinating and gives some clues to spectators. If careful eyes watch the movie, it will be enough to understand the film, but watching the film more than once helps spectators to get the details and helps them to enjoy the film. When i see the film second time, i realize that there are really too many clues that prepare spectators to the end of the film.The start and the end of the film is well, but there are some boring scenes in the middle of the film.The sound of Tesla's invention is a bit disturbing. We had to plug our ears in these scenes.Christian Bale's and Hugh Jackman's capabilities worth to be seen. It is a good job of Nolan."
" ""im part of the act""
",,"big Christian bale fan, this was the only reason i watched the film as from reading the back cover i wasn't convinced, i dislike films of this genre.I was pleasantly surprised, as always bale's performance was awesome. His ability to mimic accents from different regions is undulated. the story line is a bit slow but i definitely recommend trying to get your head into this particular film as the ending is one of the best endings i have seen.Jackman also provides the goods, a very convincing act.ill definitely watch out for more Chris Nolan flicks.rob"
" Classy and good!
",,"Basically this is just a very well made movie. It has both style and a good story, with some interesting twists and great actors in it.What gets noticed first is how incredible good and style-full the movie is looking. The cinematography, costumes and make-up are all fine looking and provide the movie with a great atmosphere, that is also suiting for the time period the movie is set in.But also the story is also fine and intriguing. At first sight the movie doesn't sound like anything too tense or spectacular; two rivaling illusionist who literally start to battle each other. However the movie does become tense and good as the story progresses. The whole way their rivalry gets portrayed in this movie is done so well, even when it starts to take extreme and obsessed forms. You also never really get to pick sides for any of the characters. At times you're for the one and against the other but eventually both characters have their good and likable sides and their evil and unsympathetic sides. You never love them but you also most certainly don't ever hate them.And finally a movie again with a real good surprising ending! The movie does has some predictable tendencies but eventually the elements in the movie always end up differently then you expect them to, including the ending.The movie does get unnecessarily hard to follow at times, which is due to the way of storytelling. You know, I hate it when movies use non-linear storytelling, just to look more smart. But with Christopher Nolan movie's this never really is a big issue, since he handles this always so well, with of course ""Memento"" as a perfectly executed example.Not every story element in the movie works out. Especially the relationship elements in the movie shows some flaws and have some unused potential. It just doesn't seem to me that portraying and using romantic relationships in movies is really Nolan's thing.Christian Bale was impressive as always. I love it how he always uses a different accent, though his way of acting always remains the same. But Hugh Jackman was also surprisingly great. I'm glad that he isn't being typecast since his first appearance as Wolverine in ""X-Men"". With this movie he once more shows that he also can handle far more 'heavier' and demanding roles. David Bowie surprisingly also shows up again in a good role. Guess it sounds weird but I really think David Bowie is one of my favorite actors. It was also fun to see Andy Serkis. Amazing, 5 years ago nobody would had ever thought about casting Andy Serkis in their movie, even though he has been active in the business since the early '90's. Amazing what playing Gollum did for his career. Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson also have parts in the movie but their characters would had been just as good and interesting if they were being played by John and Jane Doe, though I like Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson as actors and appreciate them being in this movie.Even though the movie is tense and told in a difficult way, the movie also remains a perfectly entertaining one to watch. All of the magic tricks in the movie are done well and it also gives us a look in the way magicians worked and how tricks were created and executed. I also love how they kept the movie and its tricks also always as authentic as possible. It always looks like a magic trick and never like a computer effect or anything. Something that wasn't the case to that other and definitely also lesser illusionist movie ""The Illusionist"", also from 2006.I wish there would be more movies like this.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
" Truly Magical
",,"""The Prestige"" was box office magic, and for good reason. The film chronicles the brutal rivalry between two former friends, Angier (Hugh Jackamn) and Borden (Christian Bale). The story is set in 19th century Britain, and is a tale of magic, betrayal, greed, and trickery. So as not to spoil the plot, I'll focus on the acting and visuals, mostly. Angier is the more likable magician of the two rivals, and this is mainly due to the superb portrayal of him by Hugh Jackman. Jackman is not over-the-top, yet possesses an unwritten magic about him in this film. He turns in stellar work in a more restrained part than usual. Bale is effective and very good as Borden, but I found his character cruel and annoying. Still, he, like Jackamn, does very well with the proper accent. I just felt he was a bit too over-the-top at the wrong moments, and I felt for his wife.Michael Caine plays the mentor of the two magicians, Cutter, and is absolutely superb. His voice is impeccable and easy to listen to, and I really liked his character. Scarlett Johansen, who usually plays trashy and useless roles, is actually very good in the film. She looks fantastic and plays her part just right, with a little bit of sass, but not too much. I also enjoyed the work of David Bowie and Andy Serkis as Tesla the scientist and his assistant.The other magical part of ""The Prestige"" is the mood and visuals. The costumes are all pitch-perfect, making the time period obvious. The cinematography is gorgeous, always setting the mood in a kind of subtle way. Christopher Nolan gives the film the dark edginess it needs, and I was engrossed from the beginning.All in all, the film is great. It has its minor flaws, but Christopher Nolan and the cast bring it alive in thrilling fashion. It's a great film for magic enthusiasts, but also for the general audience (I can't do a single magic trick). Go and rent it right now if you can, and you won't be disappointed!"
" A well crafted film.......but The Illustionist and The Prestige at War.
",spoiler,"Well first off this is a amazing movie, great graphics, actors etc.... Beautifully done and directed. Indeed Chris Nolan may be one of the worlds greatest directors, like Batman begins was amazing to. Christian Bale does a well done part, and Hugh Jackman is always like his best. But I have to differ with another movie on illusions. The Illustionist. This is another well crafted movie, but it is more simple and reveals all the tricks at the end. Some people I have talked to the Prestige about get confused about this movie. People think that the father was beheaded at the end or was the look alike beheaded (maybe it was his brother??????)But these two movies both show great work and sacrifice in the characters part, and also in the script. Like when Borden and Angier fight the battle of Magic. Compare this scene to the war of the love of the women in Illusionist (Jessica Biel) I have to give both of these movies 8 out of 10 stars because they are both beautifully crafted movies, and have great astonishing actors and actresses. Two thumbs up for both.!!!!!!-Missy"
" A little bit of Nolan
",,"I told myself that I would watch this movie once more before writing about it. I have already done it, and this is what I have: Christopher Nolan has done four very good and very different films; ""Memento"", ""Insomnia"", ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Prestige"". That the last one is a little better than the previous ones only shows his continuing growth as a writer and director. While ""Memento"" was a complex tale about an amnesic man's mind and ""Batman Begins"" a brave new beginning of the famous franchise; ""The Prestige"" is the adaptation of a novel about the world of magic.Written alongside his brother Jonathan, the director's script doesn't take long to get us inside this world where we want to believe everything; that world of tricks and illusions. ""Are you watching closely?"", a voice off screen asks as soon as the film's first frame appears; and if you don't listen or pay attention to this, you probably won't understand the story. The question is also an indirect invitation to pay attention to how the movie looks, thanks to Wally Pfister's incredible cinematography.Followed by the mentioned question, an inspired Michael Caine gives a speech concerning the three steps that complete a magic trick, while he does one to a little girl. This girl is a fundamental piece of the plot, but we find that out later. The way in which Nolan's direction and writing combine to, little by little, give way to new developments of the plot, is one of the points that show the filmmaker's improvement.It's enough saying that ""The Prestige"" is about an eternal competition between two magicians, each one excellent in their own way: Robert Angier (Hugh Jackmam) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale, on the way to become a Nolan regular). And you must trust me when I tell you that such competition ends up consuming their lives; ruining the ones of the ones around them.This relationship of admiration, mixed big time with obsession, envy and resentment; can be perfectly seen in the performances the main actors assume. Being separated and meeting face to face rarely throughout the movie, is like they know each other by heart and they can look at each other; in moments where the plot puts them in different times, because the film deals with three different situations (in different times) at the same time.If you hadn't considered Hugh Jackman as talented until now, or if you had seen him as a guy with luck, ""The Prestige"" is the place to discover his interpretative power and become conscious of the talent he is. And Bale, he easily steals the show with another performance full of his own unforgettable elements. The presence of both is so strong that Scarlett Johansson, generally a main attraction, is clearly unnoticed.When the movie is over, you'll have a feeling of dissatisfaction that will make you want to see it again. I know that it happened to Matsan and it happened to me too. I couldn't do it because I saw the film in the cinema, but if you rent it don't think twice and do it because it's worth it: ""The Prestige"" is a cinematographic pearl."
" Under the Radar 10 star movie
",,"Hugh Jackman Is on fire!!!! Every movie he touches is great. A spectacular actor. Chris Nolan (the director) is also on fire. All his movies seem to be fantastic. This is not really a period piece even though it is set in Victorian England, but told not through the repressive usual way, but from the way that Victorian England was also a time of great amazement, People all over sought amazement as this time was the height of science and therefore pseudo-science. This movie has the best storyline ever. the Storyline is itself a magic trick and you won't know how it comes together till the end and when you do, it's a bit scary. A great movie totally under the radar of great blockbusters but I wouldn't have it any other way."
" Abracadabra!
",,"Christopher Nolan has directed wonderful movies like ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins"". ""The Prestige"" continues Nolan's glorious path of becoming one of the top new film-makers in the world.In ""The Prestige"" two friends Robert Angier and Alfred Borden (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) become rivals after tragic accident. First the game seems to be harmless but then rivalry becomes deathly. Both of them are trying to come up the most brilliant magic trick to become the most powerful magician. A beautiful assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) creates even more turmoil between former friends.""The Prestige"" is a flashback movie. The editor Lee Smith has established to cut the film so that it is not hard to catch every turn. Nolan has written an adapted screenplay with his brother Jonathan which is based on a novel by Christopher Priest.The cast is very best A-group. Especially Christian Bale is very convincing performing Alfred. Michael Caine is a man in the right place playing Robert Angier's associate Cutter. Superstar David Bowie appears in the film also.The film holds you till the end. I recommend it to everybody who likes thriller drama with a little magic on the side!"
" Fantastic Twist
",spoiler,"The whole movie is extremely enjoyable and well worth a watch but it's the end that just makes the film what it is. At the end you think Hugh Jackman has gotten revenge on the man who he blames for killing his wife(Christian Bale) and gotten away with it. However at the last minute Hugh Jackman is shot by Christian Bale (Who should be dead). It turns out that Christian Bale was an identical twin and he and his twin would take turns of being the real him and his assistant. This really fits in perfectly with the story on so many ways. Probably the best way is Christian Bale's relationship with his wife. You see, one day he seemed to love his wife and child but the next he seemed to care more about his work. This is because only one of the twin's loved the wife, the other didn't. There are many other ways it fits in but I don't have enough space. Great Stuff!"
" absolutely worth watching... closely
",spoiler,"I finally, got to see ""The Prestige"" last night, and it certainly did not disappoint me. It is one of those movies that is just so well made through and through. The acting is overall excellent, the plot is very entertaining with so many twists and turns that it keeps you constantly guessing what is really going on, and the directing is almost flawless. If you have ever seen ""The Usual Suspects"" (which I recently saw for the second time) and liked it, you will probably like ""The Prestige"". They share a lot of the same qualities.Most of the film takes place in late Victorian London. Interestingly, even though it seems like great pains have been taken to give a historically correct depiction of the period, the film feels very modern. Partly, this is due to the way the film is told, with a lot of jumping back and forth in time, forcing the viewer to make some effort to form a coherent story. (Not surprising for a film by the director of ""Memento"".) But also do the characters feel relevant and ""up-to-date"" for a modern viewer. Quite an achievement, since they don't in any way seem anachronistic in the Victorian environment.The story revolves around the rivalry of two young magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jckman) both trying to perform the ultimate magic trick. In the beginning of the film they are friends, but due to a tragic accident, they become deadly rivals, and it becomes unclear what drives them the most, the want for one's own success or the wish to see the rival fail. Soon it becomes a struggle of life and death, both trying to achieve the impossible, namely to at least seemingly transport themselves from one place to another instantly. Angier thinks Borden is able to do this trick, and he tries every possible way to discover the secret. This leads to him seeking out the historical inventor Tesla (David Bowie) in Colorado, a scientist who may be able to invent the impossible.Every time you think you have figured out what will happen next an unexpected twist happens, which takes you back to square one. Frustrating for some perhaps, but it keeps the movie interesting and challenging. The acting is overall very good, Michael Caine never does a bad job, Jackman and Bale are perfect in the lead roles (and this is from a man who always have had a problem with Bale), and David Bowie is entertaining as Tesla. (Although I am such a huge fan of David Bowie the musician, that I find it hard to give an impartial account of his acting.) Of course, if you really sit down and think some of the things that happen in the movie through, you will conclude that there are quite a few things that are a bit contrived to say the least. However, this does not matter, as long as it all makes perfect sense while watching..."
" Nolan hits (yet) another one out of the park
",,"No slump in sight for writer/director Christopher Nolan. He's now four for four, following up the solid efforts of ""Following,"" ""Memento"" and ""Batman Begins"" with the equally fantastic ""The Prestige."" When's the last time a writer or director managed four consecutive films under their belt that were each fiercely distinctive and creatively successful? Nolan added further insult to the incompetent and lazy of Hollywood by actually improving upon the source novel. The eye-rolling one experienced while reading Christopher Priest's prose became gasps while watching Nolan's skilled adaptation. Nolan not only ""fixed"" Priest's novel, but turned it up to 11, conceptually. Good direction and especially good writing are invisible -- people expect a competent job. Only the truly great and truly terrible stick out. Nolan's accomplished something truly great on both levels. Superb actors (especially one bit of stunt-casting comes as a wonderful surprise; usually these types of cameos detract from a picture but Nolan's steady hand delivered), lush production design and careful attention to the thematic bedrock make for a contemporary classic. The only shortcoming, which is minor, might be the show's abrupt cutting around during the first act, which could seem a bit confusing. The unique layered non-linear continuity (diary-within-diary-within-story, etc) works flawlessly when Nolan's taking his time. Keep the film's curious first image in mind while the narrative untangles and keep your mind open when things turn toward steampunk. And you fanboys who were miffed because Nolan ""wasted time"" on this feature between Batman blockbusters should rejoice. The guy has more than enough juice for the Dark Knight."
" Highly Recommended
",,"This movie is my favorite movie of all time. I saw it in theaters with my friends and was crying hysterically at the end. one of the last lines is really a killer. You have to see it at least twice to get EVERYTHING, because it is pretty fast paced compared to other movies with a lot of details. The ending will have you shocked, astonished, and willing to watch it again and again. I'm very very glad that this movie made IMDb's top 250 movie list because it deserves to be up there. Even though it didn't win any Oscars or golden globes, I know that they did a phenomenal job on it. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are fantastic actors to begin with, and this was the first movie I've seen with Scarlett Johansson in it. If you haven't seen it, go rent it NOW!"
" Great movie with superb acting
",spoiler,"I had heard great things about this film when I rented it. And I have to say that The Prestige was a great movie. I thoroughly enjoyed it. It had so many twists and turns and kept me guessing until the very end! Christian Bale plays Alfred Borden, a gifted magician who's tricks are so mind-boggling that they seem almost impossible to perform. Hugh Jackman plays Robert Angier, an equally talented magician who is good friends with Borden. But one night during a show one of Angier's tricks goes horribly wrong and his wife Julia, played by Piper Perabo, is killed. And Borden is partially blamed for the accident because he tied the ropes on Julia's hands differently. As a result of the accident Angier and Borden become rivals. They show up at each other's shows and make their tricks malfunction. One night Borden performs a trick so mind-boggling and visual that Angier sets out on a quest to find out how exactly he did it. His search for the answer delves him deeper into the mind of Borden and what really happened to his wife during that fateful trick.The Prestige was also a beautiful movie. The cinematography was excellent and the costumes were stunning. But what really made this movie great was the superb acting. Christian Bale was excellent was Alfred Borden. He spoke with a wonderful English accent. It rolled off his tongue perfectly. He made you love him because he was such a talented magician but he also made you hate him because of the way he treated his wife and the things he done to mess up Angier's tricks. Hugh Jackman is always great in any role he plays. His character Robert Angier was sympathetic and emotional and he made you feel the heartbreak he was going through. You could tell that all he wanted to be was a great magician and that he just wanted his wife back. I loved his character. The always great Michael Caine had a great supporting role as Cutter, Borden and Angier's mentor who taught them how to be the masterminds at magic. Scarlett Johansson was average as Olivia, Angier's assistant who becomes romantically involved with Borden. And Rebecca Hall was great as Sarah, Alfred Borden's neglected wife. Then David Bowie was good as Nicola Tesla, a legend in magic who Angier turned to for advice to be the best magician ever. But I enjoyed all the acting. There wasn't a performance I didn't' like.The Prestige is a wonderful piece of film-making. It was wonderfully directed, written, and acted. Any fans of Christian Bale or Hugh Jackman should watch this. I don't think you'll be disappointed. I'm glad I rented this. I truly loved it. And I loved the twist at the end. I was not expecting that and I was enthralled by it. It was superb. This is a great movie. thanks for reading my review!"
" Dueling magicians in London a century ago
",spoiler,"The Prestige is a period piece fantasy made into something resembling reality. At its heart it relies on a device from science fiction, a machine that transports people and objects by replicating them. How such a device might work is beside the intent of the movie. And that's okay. Movie goers accept premises and then follow the action without any need to examine the premise further. However I think that director Christopher Nolan might have looked more closely at the consequences of his premise. Replicating objects with electricity (pretty far-fetched of course) and moving them some distance from the replicating point is quite a feat even in the imagination. But what to do with the replications? Nolan's solution: kill them off. In fact kill off the original and keep the replication.Now if you are magician Robert Angier (Hugh Jackson) and you know that you are about to die, and in fact in a most unpleasant way by drowning, I think you might be a little hesitant to perform the trick, even though a replication of you will come to life and live on. Note that both the replication and the original Angier would want to live and prefer that the other be the one to die.Nolan thought about this and that is why one is forced to die. Nolan probably would have himself preferred to keep the original and do away with the duplicate, but then the trick wouldn't work properly since the original would still be in place and not moved at all.This is an old theme in science fiction and Nolan does not attempt to improve on it. And again that's okay. But another problem with the way the premise is handled is that, although surely Angier would want to go one up on his nemesis, fellow magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and dazzle the world with this amazing trick, he might have at some point just replicated some pound notes or some bullion. If Borden had gotten hold of the machine, maybe he could have replicated Scarlett Johansson so that he and Fallon could have one each for themselves. (And one for me would be nice as well.) Or he could have replicated his beloved daughter.What I am pointing to is the irony in the way the machine was used as a vehicle for a magic trick. The trick as performed is so much less amazing than the real magic that could have been displayed, that of replicating enormously complex objects like human beings. Nobody in the film seems to realize this. This is perhaps the major--shall we say--plot cheesiness. Another, as pointed out elsewhere, is that the question Angier asks of Borden, ""Which knot did you use?"" The question is bogus as is his answer, ""I don't know,"" since Julia was still tied and the knot could be seen. Also there is the question of what to do with all those bodies being created? We see them near the end of the film in the water boxes. Seems a bit of a stretch to make all those new boxes and just leave the bodies there. Somebody might call the bobbies, don't you think? For these reasons I am beginning to wonder if Nolan is getting a little careless or if he has been corrupted by success to the point where he no longer cares about logical consistency and artistic rigor. Perhaps we'll see in his next opus. However scheduled for release next year is The Dark Knight another Batman caper starring Christian Bale.Putting all this aside, the movie is entertaining and thought provoking. Nolan's time-stirred delineation of the plot is done well and kept this viewer interested. I also liked the razor sharp psychological tension created between Borden and Angier as they compete against each other. And the many surprising plot twists and turns--something that Nolan does very well--were nice.And the cast was excellent. Michael Caine who plays the old magician and front man Cutter was perfect, and the glimpse or two we get of Scarlett Johansson was more than agreeable. Bale and Jackson were very good as well. But I especially liked Rebecca Hall who played Borden's wife Sarah. I thought she was outstanding.Now that Christopher Nolan has had back to back commercial successes with Batman Begins (2005), and The Prestige (2006), maybe it's time to think about where his career is going. Is he going to become a film maker known for his artistry like Stanley Kubrick or a film maker who knows how to appeal to the marketplace like Steven Spielberg? On the one hand there are Nolan's artistic films, Memento (2000) and Insomnia (2002) and on the other hand there are his big screen commercial successes, this film and Batman Begins. Knowing the constraints placed on film makers by the need to get funding and to turn a profit, it may be that he is trying to be both. In fact perhaps the best way to look at The Prestige and Batman Begins is to recognize that they are artistic films made within industry constraints that require mass market appeal.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
" Great movie, a bit tense
",,"As Hollywood made a habit of, we were presented with two magician movies in the same year. I really enjoyed The Illusionist, which was a very well done movie and in which the level of tension was high, but not enough to distraught my wife. But The Prestige goes over the edge. It presents the bitter rivalry between two magicians (and I mean BITTER). They hurt and humiliate each other and finally resort to murder. The wife couldn't handle it all, she said she can't bear to watch so much evil and childishness. Of course, she would have gobbled everything if it involved two women fighting for a man or any such nonsense :)It is a movie about obsession. And sacrifice. Boys and their toys, gone really bad. The atmosphere is made even more weird by David Bowie, coming to enact Tesla, the scientist who is now regarded as a modern day wizard, and by Michael Caine, who plays the ""Engineur"" in other words, the tech guy.Great movie, you should really try to watch it. Christian Bale gives a fantastic performance. Hugh Jackman was not so bad either."
" Expected to see a magic movie and I was blown away...
",,"I went into this movie and for the first quarter of the movie, it was near my expectation, then the story and where the characters go with their intentions and plans just totally blew me away. Great effects, great acting and a wonderful story that is about magic but also about the magic of science in the early years of the industrial revolution.I don't want to provide any spoilers so I will say, this movie may come off as weird to some and genius to others, but all in all it was well told, well executed and the production is very good. Some of the ideas, notions and magic of science in this film. Top notch acting, great mixture of characters. You will like this movie if you liked movies similar to Requiem for a Dream, The Illusionist, Donnie Darko, The Fountain, and film in the like."
" Nolan's real follow-up to Memento
",,"After his brilliant breakout film Memento, director Chris Nolan went on to create the forgettable Insomnia and the overrated Batman Begins. The third outing to come (The Prestige), however, is his real follow-up to Memento, in my own honest little opinion, both in quality as well as in depth.This moody and complex film is a real treat for cinephiles wherever they are. Describing a fatal rivalry between Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), two competing magicians in 19th century London, it capitalizes largely on the length some people will go just to get even with their professional opponents. While the magic displayed on screen is what catches your eye at first, it is the swirl of emotions our two lead characters go through that makes this a true delight. Spanning over numerous years, we see Angier and Borden going from great career and personal heights to the lowest bottoms in their pursuit of the one true magic trick that'll make people remember them for years to come.To top this all up, the movie itself acts as the ultimate magic trick, with its various acts working as the required steps that allow us to fully enjoy and realize the final twist for all its brilliance and originality."
" A pretty good film
",spoiler,"I liked this movie all right. It was visually beautiful, well-directed and cleverly laid out. I felt like the director led me through the plot twists wonderfully; with just enough mis-direction and showmanship that I was slowly starting to catch on, but not confused at the final reveal. It was a great surprise and really left you thinking.My only complaint is that I didn't feel emotionally invested in any of the characters. Robert is angry at his wife's death but she is gone so early in the movie that you don't really feel the pain of his loss or understand his obsession. Borden's main motivator is the love for his daughter but you don't really get that either. He's presented as an emotionally unavailable man who is more in love with what he does, rather than the family he has. Olivia comes and goes without truly capturing the affections of either man, or the audience. Her role in the affair is the same as her role in the movie; a pretty girl who is there to mislead you. At the end when you figure out what is going on, it makes a little more sense but it's not soon enough to make you feel committed to the movie, or its characters."
" A real magician tries to invent something new...
",,"...and that is exactly what what Christopher Nolan has done with this wonderful piece of conjured magic. In 2000 he amazed the viewing audience with his wonderful Momento and...trust me...this is equally as good if not better! Christian Bale shows us once more that his Reign of Fire days are well and truly behind him as he puts in a dazzling performance as the moody and slightly arrogant Alfred Borden, who triggers a series of hate fuelled events when his hunger to make tricks seem more dangerous causes the death of his colleague's wife. His former colleague, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), then sets out to destroy not only Borden's career but his whole life along with it. The pair are quickly caught up in a 'punch-for-punch' type battle which, it soon becomes very clear, will not have a happy ending. Also, credit to Michael Caine for his calming performance of Cutter who seeks to help Angier succeed but yet at the same time shows, by contrast to himself, just how enraged both characters of Borden and Angier are becoming in the battle.What Nolan has done is not only created a visually beautiful movie with his Victorian era setting but also shown us what lengths man can be driven to through competition in a way which can be related even to the present day. However, the end of the movie will not please everyone as it takes a huge jump in the science fiction direction. I however loved where he went, and I think that anyone who has even the slightest glimmer of imagination will too.A lot of people have compared this to another movie of 2007, The Illusionist. Don't! This is David Copperfield, whereas The Illusionist is Paul Daniels. A must see of 2007!"
" Magic meets OldBoy!! A mystery wrapped up in an enigma, in the pocket of Edward Nigma.
",spoiler,"If you are looking for a ""magic"" laden adventure this is not the place to search (and neither is the Illusionist). Magic does not exist in either. Both are narratives routed in reality. That is the sleight of hand that is being pushed by both.According to Alfred (Batman's butler), there are 3 parts to a magic trick : 1) The Pledge : This is the part the magician shows you something ordinary and may even let you examine it.2) The Turn : This is the part the magician takes something ordinary and does something unexpected with it. This is the disappearing part.3) The Presige : This is the punchline and the ""ta-da"" of every trick. It is easy enough to disappear. This is the reappearing.Director Christopher Nolan is still doing a time narrative, albeit not as complicated as his Memento or as dark as Batman Begins. Two magicians (Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier and Chrisitan Bale as Alfred Borden) begin their serpentine, first as colleagues and friends and then as rivals and much, much more. It is an interesting choice of last names. A Nostradamus-like prediction, so accidentally accurate to their character states. Nolan throws us clues through out the movie (much like Memento). We are forced to wait till the end and then we can follow the bread crumbs wherever they lead in the movie. Second viewings turn into a ""where's Waldo"" type of clue searching game. It is very much in the same light as a magic trick. If you found out how most work, you would realize it is rather obvious once you know. The peak of their relationship came during their act, in which tragedy ensued (the accidental death of the girl from Coyote Ugly, also known as Angier's wife). It then dwindles down to a magician's grude and a""what-you-can-do-I-can-do-better"" scenario. The director has a knack for generating an interesting weave of images and complex narratives. Much like its shadow (The Illusionist), both were marketed as something else. This one has a better cast with a better chemistry, especially between the two main characters. It also had a much better supporting cast in David Bowie, Scarlett Johansson and Michael Caine. The story did not drag at all and felt much shorter than 130 minutes.Magic is much like religion. We want to believe and such the Prestige will suck you in, till the end. It also helps that it has a style and a narrative. Technology is the new magic. It is the new fire for a new millennium for a new Prometheus to threaten the gods with. We can become gods, but like everything there is a price. If you are willing to pay your own way through this world and not just spectate or ride on someone else's bus, then you should watch this movie. Also if you haven't done so, see Street Trash. You can do it either before or after the Prestige. It works on multiple levels and viewings. Shocker might work as well. YEAH!!!!"
" The Prestige- A Truly Outstanding Movie
",,"Christopher Nolan strikes back!!!! He is one stylish Hollywood director who knows how to make you believe the unbelievable. What makes this movie so incredible is that while it is indeed a movie about magicians it is also a complex character study about how self-destructive an obsession can be. Integrating this plot with a love story and a sci-fi twist truly makes this a masterpiece. The Prestige comes with a unique plot with a fabulous drama and an amazing star cast - mainly two powerful, riveting stars in Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman any of whom could believably garner an Oscar nomination. Pitting these two seasoned performers against each other was a stroke of a casting genius- it feels like a perfect fit for director Nolan's sensibilities. The director has very well recreated a period of show business history- an era during which competition between magicians was serious and intense. The script written by director Christopher Nolan based on a novel by Christopher Priest is itself a juggling act, bouncing back and forth in time, teasing us with a whole extra layer of suspense. It keeps you interested and keeps you guessing right to the shocking but most appropriate end. A real entertainer and a truly outstanding movie, The Prestige is well worth seeing on a big screen for its grand scope and vision."
" The point isn't always to fool the viewer!
",spoiler,"It seems to me that too many commenters are invested in being tricked by the film successfully or otherwise: either they are completely baffled by the ending and delighted for being duped; or disappointed because the film was ""confusing"" and they didn't get it; or think they are really clever because they figured it all out in the first 15 minutes or whatever--and while miffed because they actually put together the narrative in their head, and have to sit through another 1.5 hours of story that is not a ""mystery"" and which doesn't ""trick"" them, console themselves by beleiving they are ever so much cleverer than the stupid Nolan brothers. Or whatever.The key thing to me is NOT whether I was tricked successfully or not (I figured the twin thing out pretty quickly, was not entirely prepared for the sci-fi angle, but wasn't devastated by the premise...kinda liked it actually). Viewer trickery is a cheap....trick. Like a bad magic show. You know it, you can sort of figure it out, but who cares. really?Rather the issue is within the narrative itself: The story of these men and their behavior. WHY is Angier so blind to the truth of his rivals trick? It makes him so crazy, he cannot see the obvious...so crazy he succeeds in finding the means to make the ""trick"" actually real--a man is actually physically transported, and no trick is involved. He makes the magic ""real"" What one should be considering is the mentality of this character...one whose obsession results in this horrifying technology...and yet who is so small minded as to use it only for this silly trick he ""can't figure out"".Remember he cannot figure out the Chinese magician's trick because he cannot imagine sacrificing himself. He is ultimately a tragic, ludicrous person who cannot see beyond his own narcissistic obsessions. The aristocrat is desperate to prove that he is superior to the working class magician and spends his life and his fortune doing so. he only ""wins"" when he leaves the realm of stage magic and illusion and uses science he bought and paid for.It is really a movie about his character, perhaps. ALso, his willingness to suicide every night--to watch himself die--expresses his character's fixation on finding a way to ""get his hands dirty"" like a ""real"" more successful magician.* * * Beside the point point: Scarlett appeared to be put there by some market study that believes a love story needs to be shoehorned in. Utter waste of time that could've been spent developing the magician characters."
" ""You have to bring it back.""
",,"Adapted by director Christopher Nolan and his brother Jonathan from the Christopher Priest novel, The Prestige has a number of secrets, cleverly wrought and carefully structured in an escalating series of dramatic revelations that may need multiple viewings to fully unravel. Tightly plotted and thematically well-crafted, the film offers converging lessons regarding seemingly harmless illusions that belie grim realities, charades that must be maintained off the stage as well as on, and the hazards of an all-important secret confederate, all coming together in climactic plot twists both haunting and unsettling.Both films also emulate the three-part structure of a magic trick, as outlined by Cutter in an opening voice-over. In old-school magic parlance, the three acts are called the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige. The Pledge offers the audience assurances that nothing funny is going on (please shuffle the cards yourself; nothing up my sleeve, etc.). The Turn is the moment when something extraordinary happens (and the handkerchief is gone!). The third act, the Prestige, seals the dealbrings the handkerchief back, say. ""It's not enough to make something disappear,"" Cutter explains. ""You have to bring it back."""
" Reminded me of the Usual Suspects
",spoiler,"Which is saying something because The Usual Suspects is in my top ten movies of all time. I felt the same way watching The Prestige as that film. It has a real mystery, who-dun-it, who is Keyser Soze feel to it. I would be surprised if other Suspects fans didn't love this movie as much as I did.The first wonderful thing about it is that you have two of the most talented and charismatic actors of their generation playing against each other. I really love this match up and they both brought it. It's probably Hugh Jackman's best role so far. Christian Bale has had a more impressive resume so of course he's great here. But I thought they really complemented each other.The story itself is great. It's about two magicians competing against one another with vendettas intact. Great stuff. An interesting thing for me was the parallel of dueling real life magicians Nicola Tesla and Thomas Edison. It was just a little touch but I thought that was pretty cool. Anyway, once the rivalry really gets going it wraps around itself so many times that it pulls you in tight. I do admit to having figured it out before the end, but instead of feeling cheated as events unfolded the way I hoped they would, I just got more jazzed. I actually had unconvinced myself of one of my guesses only to have it turn out to be true which is the same thing I did with the identity of Keyser Soze. That's probably why I'm so reminded of that movie.I think that The Prestige is better than most of the Oscar nominees for Best Picture this year. I think the costume design is the best I've seen lately. Christopher Nolan hasn't done anything wrong yet. And I do think this is his best film.I actually have forgotten what the rating is for this film but I would recommend for most people over 10, who enjoy magic and mystery and great film-making."
" Revenge To The End
",,"If one had to pare down THE PRESTIGE to two words, they would undoubtedly be ""dark"" and ""twisted."" Coming from director Christopher Nolan, who gave us the BATMAN BEGINS gem, this shouldn't surprise anyone. Nolan is also responsible for the successful somewhat underground-ish film, MEMENTO, another flick that fits perfectly within those two pared-down words.Similar in style to THE ILLUSIONIST, but with much more substance, The Prestige has a unique flow and some surprisingly good acting from previously unknown places.Like Memento, the story jumps around time-wise, going from present tense, to past, then even further past before heading back to present tense (excuse the use of literary style rather than film, as this seems to also apply here), director Nolan has given us a study in revenge based on the lives of two fictitious magicians in the late 1800s. They are Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman, THE FOUNTAIN), and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale, BATMAN BEGINS). Initially friends who's relationship is shattered by the death of Robert's wife after a terrible on-stage accident, the two become mortal enemies in a one-upmanship that leads to bad ends for both men.The two opponents are willing to do whatever it takes in order to be the best magicians in the world. This often entails ""getting one's hands dirty."" Severing body parts, breaking one another's bones, and using anything and anyone to further their goals is a necessary evil.Double, triple, and quadruple-crosses await the viewer in this stark but beautifully filmed movie. The sets are awe-inspiring (in their own dark way) and each shot given plenty of thought with regards to shadow and contrasts.The big winners for the film, though, are the script and a surprisingly excellent performance by David Bowie as the genius (and real life) inventor Nikola Tesla. Melding fiction with nonfiction was a nice touch and added to the overall concept of the film.Many may be able to figure out ""the big secret"" long before it's revealed (this reviewer was able to deduce it rather easily), but this won't take away from the enjoyment of the film going experience. The great acting, moody sets, and applaudable screenplay will keep most viewers enthralled regardless."
" Very good and highly recommended, but not in my top 10 for the year
",,"I've read some of the other reviews after seeing this, and I have the urge to say, ""Get real, this was darn good, but it wasn't THE QUEEN or THE DEPARTED. It's sure better than 75% of the movies out there though.It's about magic and it draws a person into this world of illusion. Unlike THE ILLUSIONIST, this goes into a world of professional rivalry which escalates until it becomes deadly. As such, it entertains massively and is a movie one will be glad to have seen.This shows that Christopher Bale and Hugh Jackman certainly are serious actors capable of being more than comic book characters, and Christopher Nolan is more than a director of comic book adaptations.This is indeed a movie to see, but don't stop here. See THE ILLUSIONIST for a different perspective on the world of illusion and those who live in it."
" This is what movie making is all about
",,"I have never, ever seen a movie this good in my entire life! The acting is fantastic, the story is 100% original, and the end blows you away! When I first saw the trailer for the movie I knew instantly it was going to be a good one. How many movies are there of magicians and stuff like that? I really enjoyed this film. This is the best movie I have seen Christian Bale in, and he really did an amazing job! Scarlett Johannson and Hugh Jackman did a fabulous job also. The chemistry between the actors and characters was unbelievable! It kept the suspense going through the entire film making me think ""oh my god, what's going to happen? what is he going to do?"" and I love that in a movie! The ending, of course, was so cool! This is definitely ""movie making at its *very* best!"" If you haven't seen it yet, then watch it! You'll be astonished at how amazing this movie is! I don't understand why it didn't win every single Acadamy Award...Well, then again, critics don't know how to critique the right way so...oh well. Just watch the movie, OK? You'll love it! Guaranteed."
" The Prestige set out as a thriller, but ended as a fairytale
",,"The Prestige is about two rivaling magicians that started as colleagues, but an unfortunate even led them to be enemies obsessed with the others failure. Then they go through great lengths to sabotage and steal the other person's tricks, for revenge and for a magicians honor. The movie is entertaining, because the setting/scenario is quite original - except that there is also the Illusionist, but that movie has a different theme - and Christopher Nola directed it. It made the story telling very interesting. However as the twist and turns unfold, you start to expect a brilliant ending, I call that the 'Wow'-factor. You remember watching Memento and at the end you find out he already avenged his wife and you go Woooowwwww in your mind ;-) The 'wow'-factor in The Prestige is disappointingly low as they use unrealistic elements to do the ending that you're not prepared for in the beginning. The let you expect it's all science behind the illusions and tricks, but then half-way the movie they come with something new and scientifically speaking, utterly nonsense. So set yourself for one of the most entertaining movie right now, and you'll enjoy it even more if you don't take the movies realism serious. Great acting from Christian and Hugh that alone is worth the time."
" nice...
",,"..this movie rocks big time!! since i saw its trailer, i've been wanting to see it in the movie house..i quite expected a boring movie though (i mean, some movie stories are interesting but the scenes just drag throughout)..but The Prestige really surprised me! not one part was boring! it kept me (and my friends) thinking...really nice plot...i commend the writer and the director..this movie however is not a movie for everyone. but to those who want to watch a movie they can scratch their heads over (and rave over the plot), well, you better grab a DVD copy now! ""nice kaayo!""..it won't disappoint you...you should WATCH CLOSELY..."
" fairly predictable, but enjoyable
",spoiler,"For some reason, when watching a Hollywood movie about magicians, before you've seen a single frame, you expect Hollywood magic as well. Magicians, perhaps owing to the number of fantasy movies coming out in recent years, immediately make one think of wizards, not illusionists. At least that how it was for me, and that is how I watched this movie. When looking for the unexpected, which most people will do given the advertising for this movie, it is not hard to find at all, and while the exact details are only revealed later in the movie, the ending of the movie becomes clear at least an hour before it occurs, taking the edge off the 'suspense'. This is in part the fault of the decision to use flashbacks. Had the storytelling been more linear, the careful listener would not have heard details which reveal what is only shown later in the movie.So much for the plot. The acting is very enjoyable for this type of story. The chosen time period, while not shown in detail, adds charm to the story. Although I never do get that feeling of really looking at the past, the locations are wonderful, as are the costumes.I do think the film is concerned too much with the plot, and not enough with the characters, but given the plot, that is to be expected as well, perhaps. A little more depth wouldn't have hurt, though.An enjoyable movie, even if you can see the conclusion coming. I wouldn't have liked to have missed it."

" Abacadabra - no bunny from the high hat
",,"At the end of the 19th century two helpers to an illusionist are good friends. One of them married to a third help. They pick up the tricks from their master and things go well. Until a sudden event changes things in a big way. The friendship turns sour and they go their own separate ways.The rest of the film is that tale - what happens after they split up. Played out in various time splits, going backward and forward through time at will. It isn't hard to follow, and the changing of time works as a positive - it keeps the story more interesting. It gives a good insight into why everyone is the way they are and why they do the things they do.The story is believable, even in the time it is set in, apart from one thing. And quite frankly it was that one thing that more or less turned me against the film, but not too bad. It was still very enjoyable. Some of the things it touches on are actual history and that is very funny to see.All in all. Rather enjoyable, a nice way to spend an evening. Nicely filmed, nicely played out, great musical score.7 out of 10 tricks played out."
" Whats the ending credits song called?
",,"I would like to know what the song is called when the credits role? The song at the very end is quite good i would like to know the title of the ending song. It is played right after Micheal Ciane says all of the acts and after you see the final image the credits begin to role and the song begins, i just want to know the title of that song its very catchy, it has a cool beat to it and the vocals are good too. the movie overall was amazing i never thought the twists would end there were so many times where i thought that it was the final conclusion but there was always something much more exciting that would be later revealed. I really started to follow Christian bale's character up until Huge jackmans new trick which i didn't see coming at all, the ending however was really good i really enjoyed this movie."
" Are You Watching Closely?
",,"The competition between Bale and Jackman is mesmerizing. They each have a separate way of drawing you in and making you sympathize with their own struggle. Jackman is a man completely obsessed with finding the secret to Bale's mysterious abilities. Bale, it seems, is only half a man at any given time, sometimes completely engulfed in his magic and illusions, other times he is a warm loving husband and father who just happens to be a magician. Every time Jackman and Bale are on the screen together you can feel yourself pulling to the edge of your seat waiting to see whats next in their quarrel for greatness. Deep and dark secrets lie in both men, but you cant help but wonder who has taken it too far. With more than a few unexpected plot twists, and laden with hidden clues throughout the movie as to the truth behind both men, The Prestige is a movie you need to watch at least twice. While you watch it ask yourself, as Bale says many times throughout the film, are you watching closely?"
" Riveting
",,"I actually saw Prestige by accident; although I had heard good reviews there were other films that I preferred to see. As it happens the night I was at the cinema the film I had wanted to see was sold out and I decided to see Prestige instead. I can only say it was a superb film (even better then the film I had originally wanted to see).I thought both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale portrayed their characters in a really realistic way, and it was difficult to decide which one you would support, as like real life, the moment you thought one was better then the other, they went and did something that totally spoilt your choice and you were back to square one.It was a slower moving film, but it was handled brilliantly, and the twists were simple but effective.Quite simply it was the best film I had seen of 2006."
" True Cinema Magic
",spoiler,"Like great stage magic, THE PRESTIGE is a work of craft not commerce, and as such it is a daring and delicate piece of art. The Nolan brothers have adapted Christopher Priest's dense novel into a bold, powerful film which, like even the simplest of magic tricks, could fail miserably were one false move made in its execution. Yet as the director of a complex psychological tapestry such as MEMENTO or the character-driven revival of a pop culture knight in BATMAN BEGINS, Christopher Nolan electrifies THE PRESTIGE with the dark mysteries of the human soul which propel these two magicians into chaotic conflict, never once bungling his three-act wonder.As for the screenplay, once again the Nolan brothers base their films on a sturdy foundation of a script, which exploits the subject's inherent bias toward illusion without ever devolving into a gimmick-cluttered plot. Though there are plenty of suspenseful twists and turns as these characters pursue ever-darker paths of professional achievement and personal destruction. The script invites its audience to look behind the curtains of stage magic without ever fully surrendering the artistry behind it. THE PRESTIGE is the difference between knowing the trick and knowing how to perform it, perfectly demonstrating our fascination with revealing a mystery and still being captured by it. As layer upon layer of illusion, lies and half-truths are peeled back, our journey to the heart of this intense rivalry of magicians becomes more obscured by how these men manipulate reality to confound our suspicions and expectations. The end result is sheer, enthralling entertainment.THE PRESTIGE is the third stage of a magic trick, ""the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" And so THE PRESTIGE delivers on that promise, as Christopher Nolan adds another masterwork to his rich history of film successes that promise only to grow better and more consistently enjoyable with each project. His latest work, is no parlor trick at all  THE PRESTIGE is true cinema magic."
" A Masterpiece of Originality
",,"It is not often that we are given the privilege to see a truly original story, not a remake with different faces and effects but instead a unique tale. It is a regular complaint by movie enthusiasts that the business is dominated by copied or reworked story lines. This film has consistently pushed the boundaries just as the Matrix did when it was first released. Not many movies can boast such a debate over the tiny details or the implications of the actions of each character. When the machine is first seen in its detail, the ruthlessness of Angier is truly discovered. While movies such as the Sixth Day attempt to debate the ethics of such a device, The Prestige simply uses it to highlight the greed and burning ambition of a man. This movie is very complex in its themes and plot and it is encouraging to see a film that forces the viewer to think and review the storyline again and again to try and determine the truth. Is it not also ironic that while we the viewers are attempting to seek the truth, so the characters are seeking to disillusion us, just like a magic act. We are forced, in a sense, into volunteering for the magician which shows us in the end how incredibly well thought out this storyline really is. Cutter seems to sum it all up for us - 'Now you're looking for the secret... but you won't find it because you're not really looking. You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled.'"
" The best movie of 2006
",,"I really liked this movie, specially the metaphors and plays about the different identities of the characters and the astonishing tricks. I was so amazed that i decided to spend all my life trying to obtain the ""Transported Man"" trick. I've given a first try, check it out!Copy and paste: http://one.revver.com/watch/157915Just to be honest, i've to say that many of the techniques and the ideas shown in this movie had been already used by the director Christopher Nolan in ""Memento"", which is with no doubt (imho, obviously) his real masterpiece: flashbacks, enigmas, ambiguity of the characters, etc. Perhaps ""Memento"" is a little excessive; in order to fully understand the movie you must watch it almost twice (with high level of attention). ""The Prestige"" is a more commercial version of Memento, but it includes all the features and the ideas that made fantastic Memento."
" A dark tale about the obsession of being a true magician and the sacrifices necessary
",spoiler,"As has already been mentioned enough, the cast and acting are first rate, so I'll shift my focus on the meta level of this terrific plot. But forgive me as I have to mention that seeing David Bowie as Tesla was just brilliant! Well I saw the movie the second time tonight and it just hit me, how perfect all the edges and twists come out in the end and perfectly make sense. It is simply brilliant, how the two opponents are not just simply opponents, but as the story unfolds not only do they become the total oppositions of each other, but also turn out to be the almost complete antipode to the characters they started of with, themselves. One had everything and was already complete, but has indefinitely lost it. So now he has to become more to do the trick and be able to live on. The other is the cause for his loss over and over again and also seems to be getting what he has lost. But has to suffer from having to live as an entity of two men, all the time, only to finally become one in the end. After he himself has almost lost everything. The showing and telling of the simple bird-trick at the beginning and ending of the movie exemplifies this. And we see and hear it in a completely different way then, than we did in the beginning. Because now we simply know. One has to make huge sacrifices, the sacrifice of life, either way! If the world sees/knows or not. It shows on many levels, how obsessions can make us lose everything we have and ever wanted, even if or especially if we can have it all and take it for granted. Over revenge, rivalry and simply over being the greatest magician, ... In the end what does it offer us, staying true to ourselves, our love for our family and friends and as in every relation, the herein literally vital need to communicate everything."
" this stylish thriller perfectly works on many levels
",,"The Prestige is a stylish thriller, story about obsession, magic trick and metaphor of a film art at the same time. Thanks to director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Batman Begins) the movie perfectly works on every level. On the most obvious level - it is a superbly shot thriller keeping in a heart-pounding suspense with numerous twists and turns. As regards psychology, we have a dangerous obsession with searching for something new and an intense rivalry between two different personalities, which is reliable owing to excellent performances by two leads - Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman. Their characters are not only obsessed with personal ambitions, but they also resign from family life by hurting people they love. In the allegorical sense, the flick is an overt metaphor of the magic trick in which creators show more things than actually communicate and viewers' aim is to decipher a riddle. Besides, they often reveal secrets concerning the enchantment. Finally, Nolan focuses on a labourious creation process. Filmmakers, just like illusionists in this movie, do everything within their power in order to amuse viewers and the effect is sometimes incommensurate to their hard work and devoted time. To conclude, The Prestige is a first-rate cinematic experience which both criticizes and glorifies film-making."
" Twists and turns don't always work, but still a fascinating study of obsession
",spoiler,"On surface level, the film is a gorgeous treat. It is beautifully designed and crafted, with lush and never too eye-popping cinematography while still remaining quietly beautiful. All the set and costume design perfectly emulates the Victorian time period without ever seeming like it's trying to hard. On the contrary  as a historic presentation, it is a very fascinating portrayal of a form of entertainment that reached indescribable peaks of popularity during this particular time period. From a technical standpoint, the film is a sleek and stylish success.It also uses an interesting storytelling technique of a mixed-up chronology in order to further add to the initial confusion, although everything comes together in the end. It's not quite on par with the mixed chronology of 21 Grams, but it's an interesting sort of ""return to form"" for director Christopher Nolan after Memento.The acting is also fantastic from everyone involved, although nobody stands out in particular. Bale and Jackman lead the pack and both provide excellent turns, while the supporting players Caine, Johansson, Bowie and even Andy Serkis' small but memorably supporting role all provide satisfying performances with much expertise.But it is when we get to the story itself that the film somewhat trips over itself. Fact of the matter is, the twist (or rather, twists) at the end of the film were, at least as I found, painfully predictable. Let's not mention the Angier twist which became apparent the moment the surprise success of Tesla's machine is revealed: But even the Borden twist, which was slightly more surprising if you ask me, was easily foreseen  the way Nolan presented the character of Borden's mentor/secret keeper came across as extremely suspicious from frame one, and it soon became apparent that the solution to Borden's trick lay within this character. On the other hand, one element of the story that could have gone wrong but instead throws the movie in its most interesting direction is the somewhat science fiction/fantasy element of Tesla's machine  more on this later. I found the end in which everything is revealed to be more under whelming than what Nolan may have been aiming for, but luckily, Nolan doesn't fail to deliver.Had the film been left in the hands of another filmmaker, the twists at the end may have been portrayed as the point of the film. And the repetition of Cutter's opening lines may throw the audience off guard and in the direction of the twist being of the most importance. But it is not so. The true meaning of the film lies in the line ""No one cares about the man in the box."" Allow me to explain.While slightly failing in the storytelling department, as a tale of morality and the human spirit, the film is incredibly successful and amazingly poignant. It seems that Nolan's auteur as a director is beginning to take form, as very specific themes can be found in all of his features. First and foremost, all of his features deal with the human mind one way or another. Memento and Insomnia both portray a mental condition. Batman Begins certainly portrays how Bruce Wayne was scarred for life by a traumatic event (the death of his parents) that drives all of his actions in the film. And now The Prestige also portrays a similar scarring, of how a traumatic event can lead to dangerous obsession. Which brings me to a further and more specific theme Nolan has in all of his features: Obsession. In Memento, Leonard is so obsessed with finding his wife's killer, he simply refuses to accept that he has already been found, since obsession is all that drives him through life. In Insomnia, Dormer's character forms a very unhealthy obsession with the murder involving Walter. In Batman Begins, Bruce Wayne's obsession with revenge against his parents' death drives him to extreme measures. And now in The Prestige, we find Angier, who is clearly obsessed with proving his worth against Borden, throwing all moral boundaries out in order to achieve his goal. Imagine the moral implementations of killing yourself again and again and again but always coming back. It's mind-blowing just to think of how obsessed you must be to do such a thing to yourself.Ultimately, while the twists of the film don't necessarily work, it is a lavish and beautifully produced product while managing to both entertain and portray a haunting depiction of human morality, obsession and the human mind's shocking ways of dealing with such things. In this sense, the film is an utter success, and a harrowingly difficult one to process at that."
" Best sci-fi/thriller ever!!!!!
",spoiler,"This movie is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen... The actors - mostly Bale, Jackman and Cane - are great. The storyline is well designed. Brilliant movie!!!Of course I have some questions... (SPOILER!!!!!!!!!!)Does Borden (played by Christian Bale) really have a twin brother, or it was also a clone?? It makes no sense to make ""TESLA"" the keyword for his diary, unless he had some connection to Tesla. And if he had, it's possible that he also tried the teleportation machine... and cloned himself. The only difference between Borden and Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) is that Angier really wants to be teleported, while using a double is enough for Borden. So after Angier teleports himself, he always has to kill his clone...Tough movie... I have to see it again and again... :-)"
" Really now, DO watch closely!
",,"All I really want to say is that Christopher Nolan is The King of the little details in modern cinema. And the mixture of talent and perfectionism in this film/guy is close to frightening. So watch very very close (to be read as: ""Watch the movie AT LEAST one more time"") and you will be deeply and utterly rewarded. Another thing is the brilliant cast. Kudos to everyone involved but the three big names are these of Caine, Bale and Jackman (in that order). Phenomenaly presented witty screenplay, with unexpected twists and some really fresh humour. But make no mistake, this is not a comedy, the jokes will only make you feel a little bit more cosy. What you will also experience is a masterly Nolan-blend between reality and mysticism.Thousand thumbs up for a genius at play! 10/10"
" Beautifully filmed, gripping film!
",,"This film is beautifully made, the acting is superb and the story keeps you on the edge of your seat from the beginning to the end. There are NO boring bits! It's the kind of film that gets you thinking afterwards.The story grips you from the very beginning, and it is filmed in a way that leaves you hooked on every scene, every last word. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Kane are superb, as usual. When you have three actors such as these and a magnificent story like this one, the result is pure magic. No wonder it has made the top 250 IMDb list already.If you're heading towards a movie theater anytime soon (or a DVD store in the future), I recommend- no, I *insist* that you watch this film.I have not hesitated at all to give this film a confident 10/10!"
" Good stuff!
",spoiler,"(DO NOT READ unless you have seen the movie or don't mind having it spoiled!)The Prestige seems to be one of those rare occasions when the movie is better than the book it's based on. The movie works well, and is very well produced. It's not without flaws, but the central stroke of brilliance is to bring in Nikola Tesla and using his outlandish theories to support the story of a couple of rivaling magicians in their attempt to out-do one another. This is a great idea, and the use of it in this movie is VERY cool. To those who don't know, Tesla both theorized about, and performed, several experiments that have never been reproduced, and so it is a great way to partially suspend disbelief to have some of his wild and mysterious ideas actually work.The movie falls short in several minor ways, though. For one thing, neither of the main characters are particularly likable. They come across as just that little bit too pathetic, even if they do sacrifice practically everything for their art (or was it for their rivalry?). I felt it would have been better to have one of them (the lower-class one, Bale's character) be more sympathetic than the other, and even end up duplicating himself to sort of recreate his lost twin. But we didn't see that, and instead Bale's character cowardly just shot Jackman's character out of pure spite. Doesn't exactly reflect well on him, does it.Also - the Tesla machine; in some scenes it teleported Jackman's character, and in others it made copies of him. So, which one was it? Could it be adjusted to do one or the other? Or did it do either at random? This was not explained. And the caged pigeon trick; this was always obscured. What was it supposed to do, exactly? Oh, I can guess (it slammed down flat, seeming to crush the pigeon, which however was speedily pulled out and hidden under the coat), but it couldn't be seen, and this annoyed me as I was watching it. But maybe it was because they couldn't actually do it, and hence not show it.Still, good and entertaining movie. I could definitely watch it again sometime. 8 out of 10."
" About Freddy.....
",spoiler,"I LOVED this movie. As if the costumes, scenery, acting etc. weren't wonderful enough, the story was so riveting! It has been quite the springboard for discussions about obsession, ambition, and love with my teenage kids. What price will we pay to capture our dreams? The image of Sarah hanging with the other expendable magic objects (birds) was so chilling.I loved it even more the second time we saw it. There is one item we still can't resolve. Maybe you saw something we didn't. Was the twin of Freddy (AKA Fallon) biological or a Tesla double? Freddy was at the exhibition watching the Tesla demonstration. He used TESLA as his cipher, so he was aware of the man and his machine. My buddy and I can't agree... Or maybe it was a twin brother."
" Nolan's Real Magic.
",spoiler,"Godard's Dictum: The cinema is truth 24 frames per second."" Rejoinder: ""The cinema is illusion, is lying 24 frames per second."" *The Prestige* is everything *The Illusionist* wanted to be  and claimed to be in its trailers  an unholy tale of a magician seeking arcane Real Magic.Both films are set in 1899 London, but whereas *The Illusionist* is a whiny bitch that tries too hard to please, *The Prestige* is an egomaniac that criss-crosses veins of intrigue and misdirection, pumping you breathless with half-lies and false truths until its powerful climax.In other words, *The Prestige* is the penis to *The Illusionist'*s vagina.Christian Bale (as cockney as he wants to be) is magician Borden, and Hugh Jackman (as suave as X-Man Logan is not) is magician Angier, friends working as audience plants for an elderly magician, whose female assistant is Angier's wife (Piper Perabo, from the Julia Roberts School of big-mouth bass masquerading as beautiful women). In tying an incorrect trick knot one night, Borden accidentally gets Angier's wife killed in a drowning tank, resulting in he and Angier becoming mortal career rivals.Like a Marvel and DC Comics team-up, it's Batman versus Wolverine and, like their alter-egos from other films, Borden (Bale) is the brooding, genius magician whilst Angier (Jackman) is the showman who lives for the quick strike and audience adulation. Borden develops ""The Transported Man,"" a trick of such ingenuity Angier believes Borden has tapped into Real Magic, despite the advice of veteran magician's assistant, Cutter (Michael Caine, here playing a kind of Alfred to Borden's Batman and Angier's Wolverine simultaneously).Scarlett Johansson plays Angier's assistant, Olivia, who flits between both magicians as a double-crossing, counter-spying lover and I cannot discern whether her non-believability is because she is ""acting"" duplicitous or because she can't act; Much like Vivien Leigh in *A Streetcar Named Desire*, her false style clashes with the other polished principals; either way, chalk it up to another miscast iPod surfer girl amidst acting giants. (I suspect Scarlett continues to work in movies purely on the strength of her heaving mammii.) Cutter's voice-over describes the three stages of a magic act, all quite self-explanatory: The Pledge, The Turn, and The Prestige.The movie itself plays out the three stages, as it Pledges with an opening scene that has us believing Borden has killed Angier in a drowning tank; The Turn takes us deep into Borden's and Angier's notebooks, flashbacks within flashbacks showing us Borden, the financially-struggling magician whose incredible tricks are pearls before the swine of London's working class, whilst Angier thrills the bourgeoisie, making up for half-baked tricks with his showmanship; Borden takes a working class wife (Rebecca Hall) and fathers a child, which stokes Angier's hatred, until - The Prestige, which, as Cutter narrates, ""is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" If you heeded *The Prestige*'s opening line, ""Are you watching closely?"" its myriad mysteries would be laid bare as a Catholic priest's homosexual sins. But, like all magicians' audiences, we're here to be misdirected by the magic.Neil Burger's *The Illusionist* (2006) made the mistake of creating illusions which were too complex to be real tricks, but *The Prestige* goes in another direction, calling upon Science to augment the illusions. As Arthur C. Clarke portended: ""Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic."" And the scientist enlisted by Angier is none other than ""the man who invented the twentieth century""  Nikola Tesla, a real life Hungarian inventor, physicist and electrical engineer (played by David Bowie, in the first real acting of his movie career, burying himself in the brow-furrowed role). (If it were not for Tesla's arcane delving into nuclear physics, magnetism, alternating and direct current - yes, Tesla invented AC/DC before Bon Scott and Angus Young - we would not have those blue ""bzzzz"" things for Frankenstein movies (Tesla coils) which graduated to those crimson-blue-lightning balls (Plasma globes), also invented by Tesla  and duly misused at drunken frat parties the world over since).At one point, Tesla states, ""Exact science is not an exact science."" Though this may sound like ammunition for creationists and other lunatics, it is actually true pertaining to Scientific Method, which never lays claim to absolute truths, rather ""transitional truths""  as new information comes to the fore, obsolete information must necessarily be updated or discarded. Science is pliable, provable, practical.Still, it is ironic that in invoking the effigy of such a great scientist, the movie takes another Turn and actually breaches the bastion of Real Magic, when Tesla (aided by his Igor, Andy Serkis) inadvertently creates a machine that replicates objects exactly. Angier employs this machine onstage (with blue bzzzz's galore, natch) to recreate Borden's Transported Man illusion as ""real,"" appearing in two places simultaneously. The catch is: he must actually murder his replica every time he performs the act  to avoid hundreds of replicated Angiers. Now that's dark. And disturbingly amoral. And I love it.After the morbidity of Angier's chosen path, the movie ramps to an even darker conclusion, with the beauty of this tale's denouement lying not in its twists but in the manner writer-director Christopher Nolan unties the tale's own inescapable knots and proves *himself* the greatest magician of the film as he artfully dodges glaring plot holes and loose ends with his snake-charming sleight of hand.(Movie Maniacs, visit: www.poffysmoviemania.com)"
" Are you watching closely?
",,"Every great movie consists of three acts. The first act is called ""The Pledge""; The filmmaker shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called ""The Turn""; The director makes his ordinary film do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, ""The Prestige""; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before.So it is with Christopher Nolan's latest mind-bending masterpiece. It plays with you deliberately, as a magician's audience, makes you believe something, brings you into something which appears ordinary; believe me it isn't. The Master of Non-linear Film-making - Christopher Nolan.Hands down Oscar nomination. If I had to guarantee one nomination for this film -- Best Director."
" sensational script, good acting, marvelous job
",,"one of the best movies of 2006. I saw the movie in a business activity, and god knows I thought ""another time-wasting movie, what the hell I'm doing here, why am i not in my bed instead of being here?"". But i was wrong. from the first scenes, I was in the story. director is also very good at taking the audience wherever he wants them to be.The cast was very elite. Sir Michael Caine, as one of my favorites on all times, is doing a great job as Cutter ( as usual ). Hugh Jackman and Christian bale are the best actors for the roles as two ""competitor to wherever it goes"" magicians.The story is also astonishing, seeing Tesla on the script makes me wonder, ""what the hell's going around, why Hollywood is talking about Tesla, the genius? someone's gonna tell the world about some wonders, which Tesla invented in recent years?"" at last, I saw thousands of movie, I can understand what the hell is going on in a movie by watching it 5 minutes ( this is Hollywood's and the movie company^s bloody sin in the movie industry. making nonsense for idiots, or a few dollars more...) . This movie is absolutely not one of those cliché Hollywood produced movie!s.I highly recommend it to everyone."
" The Prestige
",,"In a time where the same ideas are rehashed, The Prestige brings the age old revenge story into a refreshing and consuming light. The movie, though long, keeps the viewers' attention and has every mind trying to figure out the story before it even comes to an end, however, a second viewing of the movie might prove better than the first; for those who love to solve mysteries. Upon the second viewing is when subtle clues become more clear and the ending of the film becomes much more believable. A great story is only great when it can be told and seen more than once, and the Prestige gives its audience more than enough fuel to suggest it to other movie goers, and of course, attend the movie with them."
" The amazing world of magic and wizardry.
",,"Before watching this movie, I've already known Christopher Nolan from his several previous works such as Memento, Insomnia and Batman Begins. His talent as a director is a gift given not to so many, and that gift made the movie ""Prestige"" a masterpiece. The movie grips you to your seat and takes you to a world of magic and wizardry. While watching the movie, you find yourself in the middle of the war of pride and honor between two rival illusionists. They push their limits in creativity to be better than the other. All the illusions or tricks shown in the stage are amazing, and that is Christopher Nolan who gives each of them the thrill that increases your adrenaline.About the actors, Hugh Jackman is again great like he has been in many of his former movies. In the movie, after the loss of his wife, his ambitious struggle against the once fellow friend Alfred Borden (Christopher Nolan) impresses everyone. Christopher Nolan, plays the fanatic character who dedicated himself to illusions and tricks very well. Apart from these two, Michael Cane and David Bowie play the most colorful two characters. Especially, David Bowie gives life to the most debated scientist ever, Tesla.The only thing that a person should do while watching this movie, is to be patient and tolerant in the first 15 minutes of the movie. The first 15 minutes is quite confusing and one can become dizzy while following who is who. But then the movie will grab you tightly and will never let you out even many hours after it ends."
" excellent
",,"was a brilliant movie!!! beginning was a bit slow but yes very good. it was hard to understand though the ending. a quite confusing film but thats what made it so great. i don't recommend it for those who want a simple film as it is far from it. its not like those straight forward type films, in which a simpleton could understand. there are dark aspects to it which could shake up people but it gives it that suspense feel which makes you want to watch more. i was sort of put off with the film at first as it was a very boring start. it doesn't attract audiences to stay and watch the film, but lucky i did. like other film this has a slow start which may put you off but i do say that you must stay and watch the rest. overall i think everyone should watch it, it does give you different sort of movie."
" Weird but somehow very cool
",spoiler,"this is without a doubt a very clever and ...well..cool film but for once I agree with most the critics and it doesn't need to keep you guessing all the time, it didn't need to answer all the questions it raised. I did understand it though and thats says a lot about the editing and script. It is really one weird story but there is superb acting in it. YES michael caine is doing the same role as he always does and to an extent so is hugh jackman but they do it so well you really can't begrudge them it. But Christian Bale who I had never seen before was amazing, I completely loved him and I found him so believable I believed the loony story. He is going to be the next johnny depp (not that we really need another) but he is really really good. recently though, in all films there seems to be a fascination with fingers, or more to the point fingers getting cut or mashed or shot and this film is no exception. Kiss Kiss Bang Bang a guy gets his fingers cut off and in this a woman breaks hers and poor poor Christian Bale gets his shot off. It really isn't safe in showbiz now is it?"
" almost, but not quite
",,"Every once in a while there comes a movie that is captivating. When watching such a movie, one forgets that he or she is even watching a fictitious story at all, and when such a movie ends, movie-goers excitedly try to remember every last detail of its plot and try to more fully appreciate every intricacy that went into it. More often, however, there are movies that seem to have all of that in the works, but just miss the mark. Christopher Nolan's (Batman Begins) newest film, The Prestige, is an example of the second type of movie. The acting, costumes, and editing that worked so well to immerse the audience are all but wasted due to the film's disappointing conclusion.Christian Bale (of Batman Begins fame) plays Alfred Borden, a magician who at the start of the film is on trial for the murder of fellow magician, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman). Borden is convicted and sent to jail to await his execution. While in jail he is given Angier's diary to read which chronicles Angier's rivalry with Borden, and his obsessive attempts to recreate Angier's ""disappearing man"" trick.The first element that comes into play is the editing. Nolan chooses to tell his story non-linearly, starting en media res and skipping from various points in time in each of the character's lives. In so doing he is able to take relatively simple subject matter (the rivalry between the two men) and maximizes its effect. Each scene is edited in such a way that it reveals something new about the character, that if done otherwise would not be as evident. Nolan also manipulates our emotions by constantly showing the darker sides of the two main characters in such a way that we don't know who we should sympathize with.Of course without the wonderful performances all around, the editing would be rendered moot. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play their roles pitch perfectly. How interesting it is to see both of these actors fresh off two comic book movies (Batman Begins for Bale, and the X-men trilogy for Jackman) both able to adjust themselves to more serious roles. Jackman's obsessiveness is always believable, never forced. Likewise, Bale' portrayal of the arrogant and selfish Borden is totally convincing. Bale, who is Welsh, once again proves that he is a master of accents, moving so easily from the American accent showcased in Batman Begins to a British accent here in The Prestige. Of special consideration is David Bowie in the role of Nikola Tesla. His character is called in near the end to help Angier finally create a better magic trick than Borden's ""disappearing man"" trick. Bowie owns the role, demanding out attention, being both sympathetic and cocky at the same time.Finally, the costumes and set designs all work to immerse us in the story. The movie was shot on real locations, and it shows. The costumes look entirely period, and before we are even told that the movie takes place in 1887, we know right by looking at the characters. If the movie doesn't get nominated for academy awards in these areas it would be a real shame.The sum of all these parts help to create the illusion of reality, or rather, credibility in the story. Here in lies the major problem with the film. The ending revolves around the murder of Angier, and how it relates to the machine used in the ""New Disappearing Man Trick."" While I cannot reveal the secret, all I can say is that it is terribly disappointing. It stretches credibility too far, as if the writers had finally come to the ending without realizing that they needed to write it. It also works to discredit the characters as true magicians and inventive thinkers.In the end there is a lot to like about The Prestige. It is wonderful in both its simplicity of story and complexity of themes. It is a wonder to look at, and much can be gained from a second viewing. All you need to do is be prepared to really suspend disbelief.***/*****"
" good or bad
",spoiler,"Well, I don't know in what mood to be when I think of that film i watched. Generally, it's good film, but it has too much torn offs. I got bored of them... And though I hate Jackman, I accepted to watch the film. Bale is perfect actor, and if there was some other actor playing his role, the film would be crap! O, and by the way, Nikola Tesla did not have different eyes color. David is a person who must be respected, I agree, but he was positively funny in Nikola's role! Nice film, but too much bulls... in it! Sory to all fans, but, I gave just 7! Cheers And I have to have 10 lines, but my comment is always short and clear, so this last sentence is less sentence like ;)"
" Absolutely Magic!
",,"I love magic tricks. It's the intrigue of how the magician did it, the risk of knowing it could kill the 'assistant' and just the whole feeling of knowing you'll see something amazing.'The Prestige' is strikingly similar to a magic show that you'd see at the theatre. It starts off grasping your attention, and then quickly throws you into the action, where you see a performance gone wrong, which left me covering my mouth in shock.If 'The Prestige' had been filmed with any other actors, I probably would have been disappointed (but only so slightly). Jackman, Bale and Caine are all stars we are fond of, and they have only boosted their reputation by giving stunning performances in this film. Johansson's acting was a little dull and uninspired, but her roll was, in the end, fairly small.The storyline was at some times a bit confusing, and I found myself trying to work out what came when and who was who, but it all fell into place in the final half hour, along with a plethora of shocking twists that make the story better and better. I can't say how close it is to the book by Christopher Priest (I'm soon to read it), but from what I have heard, the films is highly respected by most fans of the novel.I don't want to go into the story too much, because it would ruin the movie for anyone. It's a film to see when you're aware and observant, though, as it's quite easy for you to get confused and possibly spoil the movie.I'm giving it 9/10, and it gets 'Film of the Year' from me, without a doubt!"
" Awesome Movie!!!!
",,"The movie is riveting! There are twists and turns throughout the movie. You always feel as if you are there instead of watching. Michael Cane, Christian Bale, and Hugh Jackman do an excellent job portraying their characters. All 3 of them are very believable and were born to play these roles. Christopher Nolan does a fantastic job directing the movie as well. I thought this movie was so good, i plan on buying it on DVD. When you see this movie, pay close attention; it is one of those movies where every detail is there for a reason. Your eyes will be glued to the screen the entire time. I saw the movie, left, and continued talking about it the rest of the week. The movie is incredible. Hope you enjoy it as much as I did."
" Stunningly beautiful film, miss on the script.
",,"It is a beautifully made film, no two ways about it. The camera work, the actors, the costumes, the sets, everything. The entire show is an eye candy. The problem, however, lies in the script. When I finished watching the movie, I had a few ""WTF?"" questions burning, but then I picked up the book and got really confused.It is a wonderful book, but what could possibly move the director to make such drastic changes to the script and completely reverse the ending? Really, if he would keep at least somewhat close to the book, the end product could have been so, so many times better. Great potential, great expectations, under-delivered."
" Clever, dark, haunting and competition to its deadliest..
",,"The author of this storyline must have the most disturbed and brilliant mind ever! This story may be sci-fi, however, the issues that we could relate to, is astonishingly in abundance. Take the core of the movie - competition of magicians. It is a reality that you must have the better trick to lure more customers. In this phase of competition, it is called healthy competition. As time passes, you move onto the next phase - resent. This is the phase where you begin to figure ideas to eliminate the competitor. Then comes the final phase - obsession. From healthy to obsessed. Obsession is the phase where you go beyond competitive elimination - which is now dangerous and life-threatening. Just like the 3 stages of magic which was the theme of the movie - The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige. These issues, although depicted in a sci-fi way, is very true in reality. Humans compete for business. Humans begin to try damaging other people's business. Humans begin to assassinate other people so they could have their turf for their business. We live in a very twisted world, and this movie is no different.You can see here, that this movie could be depicted and interpreted in many ways. Obsession could be seen as a disease, slowly gnawing your life away, leaving marks at each milestone it eats. Just like the missing finger of Borden, and the injured leg of Angier. It is full of meaning, similes, metaphors. This movie is not for the faint-hearted, and will blow your mind away. Every time you think about this movie, you seem to always think of something new, like I did with this comment above! I think this will be a classic, just like thrillers such as Seven. Dark, haunting and full of meanings.. the best psychological thriller of this era!"
" The movie of the year - just make sure you're watching closely
",spoiler,"Nolan film, check. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are the two main stars, check. A fantastic supporting cast, check. A gripping plot and subplots, check check. A worthwhile two hours, check. What more do you need?Borden (Bale) and Angier (Jackman), two appealing magicians with so much potential, begin with a respectful and trustworthy friendship and end with feelings of mutual hatred and competitive streaks. Their aim to out-perform one another ends in occurrences of violence, conflict and tragedy. You see to the full extent how people are capable of abusing their own power for selfish gain and how extreme the effects can be on the people themselves and on those around them.**MAJOR SPOILERS** The love interests, Olivia (Scarlett Johansson), Sarah (Rebecca Hall) and Julia (Piper Perabo) all stand at the heart of the magicians' competition and exploitation. Angier's need for revenge on Borden for the death of his wife involves him using new assistant Olivia as a way to discover Borden's latest and most genius trick which involves opening one door and coming out another. However, what he doesn't expect is Olivia falling out of love with him and in love with his sworn enemy, Borden. What this foreshadows is the tragic death of Borden's wife Sarah, who believed him to have had an affair with Olivia and loved magic more than her, when in fact there had been two Bordens all along - one loving one woman and one loving the other. Angier believes he has won - he has stolen Borden's daughter and put the wheels in motion for him to be hanged - but what he doesn't embark upon is that there is another Borden, the one who loved Sarah, still around and who ends up killing Angier. Of course, nothing is as it seems and the story doesn't end there - there are plenty more Angiers to go around... **END MAJOR SPOILERS**I'd seriously advise many people to see this movie more than once, it really is that superb. However, there are some scenes of violence and the mood is very dark overall so I wouldn't recommend it to children below 14. Nolan, Bale and Jackman fans in particular won't be disappointed as this film marks what is possibly their greatest talents and performances so far. Michael Caine plays the stereotypical sidekick always around for advice and yet pulls the part off as usual, with Scarlett Johansson making the best of what she can out of being the shared love between the two protagonists. Watch out for memorable appearances by Andy Serkis (who never disappoints) and David Bowie who is surprisingly good in his role.I give this movie 10/10 without a doubt. Arguably the plot goings-on are complicated but if anyone expected different, then they're missing the whole point of the The Prestige. Are you watching closely, asks Borden? I was. And I loved every minute."
" Great story. Well made.
",,"""Every great magic trick consists of three acts. The first act is called The Pledge; The magician shows you something ordinary, but of course... it probably isn't. The second act is called The Turn; The magician makes his ordinary some thing do something extraordinary. Now if you're looking for the secret... you won't find it, that's why there's a third act called, The Prestige; this is the part with the twists and turns, where lives hang in the balance, and you see something shocking you've never seen before."" The above quote is from perhaps the year's best trailer, and also appears early in ""The Prestige"", which features one of the year's best casts and crew. The quote parallels the movie quite well, explaining what works, what doesn't, and why.Directed by home run hitter Christopher Nolan (""Batman Begins"", ""Memento""), ""The Prestige"" stars a couple erstwhile superheroes (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) woven into a turn of last century tale about two rival magicians intent on one-upping each other. Simple enough, that's The Pledge.The Turn, which takes up the majority of the running time, is where Nolan and company work their movie magic. The story is told largely through various flashbacks before going linear in last act. A little work is required to follow the multi-pronged timeline, but if one lets the pieces float for a bit, they will come together over the course of the film. The patience to wait for that confluence shouldn't be a problem, because all involved sell the period piece wholeheartedly. Capes, canes, and top hats often induce boredom, but although the costumes are period, ""Prestige"" doesn't have the antiquated feel that many such films possess. Instead it radiates energy, feeling similar to a Broadway play thanks in part to the star wattage of Jackman and Bale, who both slip comfortably from rubber suits to three-piece suits. Their previous and future movie roles actually inject a little humor into the proceedings as one envisions Logan or Bruce Wayne donning such outfits and dealing with the various circumstances. Interestingly, Batman would likely be comfortable in this world, even though Prestige is set a century ago, because cinematographer Wally Pfister crafts a intriguing, borderline-Gothic world calls to mind his dark work in ""Batman Begins"", a movie that appears very different, but also shares themes like mystery and illusion.As one would expect from a magic-themed movie and as The Prestige implies, there are a number of twists and turns, several of which are unveiled in the third act. Figuring these things out in advance may hamper or at least alter your enjoyment of the film, particularly if you are expecting to be surprised. In one sense a line from the movie is true: when the secret is known, the trick seems ordinary, and that extra layer of quality is stripped away. But such knowledge in no way ruins the showmanship of the trick, or in this case the remarkably high production value of the film, which pushes the a good story to a higher level.Bottom Line: A well-made film with an original story that entertains to the end. 8 of 10."
" Good film, bad ending
",,"A great film, if a little predictable, which is only slightly spoilt by an ending which is 'somewhat' unbelievable.However the acting is great - Bale and Jackman are very good (Oscars nominations should beckon for both, although in my opinion Bale does steal the edge). They are excellently backed up by Michael Caine (who is as always great in films that he wants to be great in, and this is definitely one of them!).A film which I have recommended all my friends to definitely go and see, if only to see if they guess the Bale twist as soon as I did.In summary, it is good Saturday night out stuff."
" the REAL prestige
",,"The Prestige, a movie that will bend your mind. The prestige, a movie that will bend your back as you desperately try to see the hidden clues that you may have missed earlier on. here's my opinion on the movie. lets start with Huge Jackman. the name says it all. Jackman being Australian slang for bender of minds and back and basically thats what he does in this movie. he is great and really presents a perfect layered performance. you never really understand what he's saying but you get the feeling that he knows what he's doing. it always helps to have the ability to act through understanding and huge has got this. Scarllett Johansun, a great actor, was brilliant in mean girls and certainly has the ability to act and bend minds, but let's just say that the word fugal come to mind when talking about her performance. she knows it and it shows. George Lucas once said that if an actor doesn't want to be in a movie and doesn't believe the magic that they are presenting then it will show on film. George was right. Scarllett doesn't believe in magic and its clear. she never says anything supportive of Huge Jackman or Christin Bale because she obviously doesn't believe in magic. she needs to let herself go more and be free and stop holding onto prejudices of black people and magicians. everyone else in the movie was fine, great even. watch out for the star cameo role (you'll know it when you see it). let's just say that the butler from the nanny named Fran would approve. Anyway, ce'lar vee, a great movie but don't see it coz u probably wont get it at all. PS Huge definitely has a notable bulge in his pants in the opening scene. i think it could help for any Oscar nods. i would give it 8 but that bulge is worth at least a 10 by itself."
" Just Plain WOW
",,"I am not one to recommend any movie to anyone because I have eclectic taste when it comes to everything. HOWEVER, this movie is incredible! The visuals are stunning, the twists are perplexing, and I applaud the costume designer for an incredible job presenting the time period without being over-the-top. What an amazing story line with the right combination of love, hate, science, magic, action and adventure! Fewer movies are being created with the energy and passion of The Prestige. Not a line or shot is wasted - and the 2+ hours run time flies by. For me, it was truly a pleasure to see David Bowie back on the big screen and playing such a key role. Of course, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are wonderful eye candy - but the depth of each of their characters draws you in as well. Perfect in every way - and in my top 10 movies of all-time!"
" The prestige
",,"The name of the movie. It says it all. Its a classic movie. Its pure class. I was spellbound by the flawless direction. The screenplay is perfect. The music, the background, the story. It was all so well knit together. Kudos to the director. I was not a big fan of either Christan bale or Hugh Jakcman..But, that has changed. These two go about their business like they are thorough professionals. I wish the movie had done better. Its a strongly recommended movie for anyone. WOW..WHAT A MOVIE!! I just had to say it again..one of my ALL TIME FAVS. I did go to see it with no expectation. I was contemplating watching another movie since I had not heard enough about this one. But, I am glad my friends came up with the idea to see this one. I paid 10 bucks to see it since it was an upperclass theater. But, I am not complaining at all. Would have paid a lot more to see it..GO watch it before any other movie.."
" Magic Act!
",spoiler,"The Prestige opens with a mysterious shot of multiple black top hats, strewn across a snow filled clearing. This shot is eventually explained, but rarely does Nolan waste a shot in this film  and rarely will it make complete sense until much later.Although The Prestige may be based on a novel, it was a novel that contained the fragmented narrative-style employed to demonstrate Leonard's anterograde amnesia in Nolan's earlier, similarly brilliant Memento. This time it's used to construct a plot in parallel with the 3 acts of magic: the pledge, the turn and the titular prestige. Superb editing creates a film analogous to its subject matter; cuts masking scenes' hidden importance at perfect moments.As if that wasn't enough narrative deceit, Priest's source novel gives us two unreliable narratives in the form of Borden's and Angier's diaries. Apart from making the plot as thick as overcooked porridge; this creates the audience to guess  as if we were watching an actual illusionist. To complete the experience Nolan gives us several shots from the audience's viewpoint  effectively leading to viewing the film being very, very much alike to real stage magic.Angier and Borden create an intriguing air of duality throughout the movie, and it's helped in no small part by a palpable chemistry between Jackman and Bale. Angier has wonderful stage presence, but less vision; Borden is a terrible showman, but is teeming with raw talent and a dangerous determination. Their obsession over their different performance of the same trick leads to an increasingly horrifying battle of wills between the two: with the men's wives, a shared girlfriend and even a daughter bearing the burden of the conflict. Cleverly, this is mirrored by two real-life figures in the film: Bowie's questionably-accented but appropriately-odd Nikola Tesla; and a talked about, malevolent Thomas Edison.The credits are abundant in big names and, as expected of a Nolan film, are predominantly British (which helps with the rest of the accents). Jackman reeks of vengeful malice; but Bale prevails as the most-watchable lead. Every syllable is mesmerizingly arrogant and intense  Bale is certainly one of the best British actors in cinema today. The real star of the show (in contrast to his role in the film) is Michael Caine however. It is a fantastic anchoring performance, as an associate of both magicians. His wizened, world-weary tones open and close the film (an explanation of the 3 acts)  and his crucial role gives moral reassurance in a troubling climax. Rebecca Hall gives a superior performance as Borden's neglected wife, and Andy Serkis is solid (and not a CGI creature!); but Johansson unfortunately falls short of her usual standards.The cast are provided with strongly authentic costumes and settings, perfectly evoking Victorian England. A good sense of the exciting advances in science is provided by the film, especially when Angier and Borden both visit a science fair for inspiration (which also features the introduction  chronologically  of Tesla). These scientists also suggest the decline of stage magic that ensued in the electrical era of today: indeed one announces that ""this is the future"".The Prestige is Nolan's fifth feature film, and is further proof of his already-sealed status as a fabulous British talent. It is an elegantly-told tale: it may be a period-piece  but it is a tour-de-force of intelligent film-making; and a firm contender for the 2006 Oscar-race."
" Excellent Film
",,"Am I the only film fan who thinks Michael Caine improves with age? Some of his earlier films are now downright embarrassing! I confess that I felt a little bit cheated during the early scenes in this film. I felt that there were unnecessarily complex scenes which did not seem to move the plot along. In retrospect they were probably simply building character etc. But after the first half hour or so we settled to some fascinating insights into these two complex characters. The whole plot was built up beautifully, with clues to the final 'denouement' that would have had Miss Marple chuckling, and no, I did not see the triple twist coming. I saw the water tank one quite early on and sat congratulating myself that I had 'worked it out'. Congratulations to the writer for having a twist that had me kicking myself for not seeing coming! I am recommending this film to all my friends."
" Amazing
",spoiler,"This is a milestone for me. I don't think I've ever seen two movies in a YEAR that I thought were utterly perfect, and here I am writing a review about my second in a month.This is one of the greatest movies I've ever seen, and I'm SO glad I experienced it on the big screen. It was a compelling story, beautifully scripted and filmed, brilliantly acted by Jackman, Bale and Caine (I like that Bale's name was Alfred this time, like Caine's was in Batman Begins). Bowie was really restrained as Nikola Tesla, and I even liked Scarlet Johannsen (that lucky, lucky, LUCKY lady...getting to cozy up to both Jackman AND Bale? Sigh). However, her role, Alfred's wife, and Andy Serkis's character could have been played by anybody. I'm not sure any of them are worthy of special mention. And regarding Serkis, all I could think of was ""my preciousssssssssssssss."" This is a movie about misdirection, and I was surprised often by the twists and turns...a rare feat for a film. I kept trying to guess where it was going and I was either partially or completely wrong almost every time. There were only 2 parts where I guessed what was coming, and I LOVED that. It was really a clever movie.After a first viewing, there are only a couple of things about this film that I didn't find utterly satisfying. One is the fact that the last fifteen minutes or so played out as though the people associated with the creation of it suddenly assumed that the viewer's brain had stopped functioning. The rest of the movie dances along just out of your full reach, begging you to keep up, waving and sticking its tongue out if you don't, then screeches to a grinding halt while two characters suddenly start explaining away every minute of the previous two hours.I didn't mark the movie down because of this. The concepts were too intriguing, the intellectual and cinematic pace of the movie moving too precisely...there are fundamentally no dead spots in this film.I wouldn't have answered ALL the questions at the end, were it my decision. I would have left at least a few questions unanswered.**************BIG SPOILER HERE***************My only other problem with this film is the question of ""which knot."" That could have been easily ascertained when the ropes were untied and removed from the body.*****************OKAY DONE WITH SPOILERS*******************However, those things said, I still can't recommend this movie highly enough. If it isn't nominated for at least a few Oscars, I'll be seriously questioning the sanity of the Academy Members. This film was very cerebral (a rarity when coupled with ""mainstream"" and big budget""), and I hope it gets the industry recognition that it surely deserves. It's a quality film, and that is a sublime understatement.I highly recommend this film. Enjoy."
" Nolan Delivers Another Fine Film.
",,"Christopher Nolan delivers another fine film with Christian Bale and Micheal Caine in tow, again. Like Batman Begins, the cinematography in The Prestige draws in the viewer whether the shot is a panoramic Rocky Mountain landscape or a squalid London slum. Nolan's sets are intrinsic to the story and make the unfolding drama all the more compelling. So much of the story is dependent upon the scenario in which a scene occurs. This is a period piece for the 21st century. The performances are very good to excellent by the entire cast. Christian Bale satisfies again with his nuanced role as a competitive illusionist. It is nice to see Hugh Jackman going for roles of substance given his strong acting ability. Micheal Caine, legendary, enough said. The women in the film are equally good. I was floored to learn that Ms. Perabo, who plays Bale's wife in the film, is a native of New Jersey. Her period London accent is flawless. Scarlett Johannsen develops nicely in this film and as long as she seeks dimensional characters like this, she can count on a long and rewarding career. Seeing Bowie on film is always a treat. His turn as Nikola Telsa is well suited to his repertoire. The story is well written and superbly directed. Anybody who writes a spoiler to this film is doing those who have not seen the film a disservice. I only hope Nolan can get the recognition he deserves when all the awards are given."
" Riveting
",,"I saw this movie today, and it was AMAZING. Throughout the entire thing, I was thrilled and absolutely absorbed in the story.It has a very interesting plot line and explores how far people are willing to go to achieve their ultimate goal. The lengths to which the main characters go to are shocking and unbelievable.Overall it is a very complex and riveting dark story but unsuitable for those who are easily frightened as there are some very frightening (and in one scene, disgusting) scenes. I remember, in the cinema, the man in front of me used his asthma puffer multiple times during the film.But if you can handle a bit of a scare and some dark themes, this is a GREAT movie, a must watch!!!!"
" Finally, a film you can really sink your teeth into, and boy is it juicy!
",,"Brilliant screenplay. Excellent acting. Perfect directing. Oscar goes to the Director, screenwriter, Actor Hugh Jackman, Supporting actor David Bowie. Yes, David Bowie is outstanding as Tesla. I could imagine an entire movie based on his character alone. I am a very discerning movie aficionado, and this the best film I have seen in years. A masterpiece of film-making thanks to Chistopher Nolan and his brother. Christian Bale is also very convincing in his role as he always is in every film in which he acts. I wish I could buy shares in his career fund. I would surely make a million!Michael Caine is always great as a supporting role and adds a dimension of warmth and humanity to every film he is in.This is one film you won't want to miss a moment of, so get your snacks well before the opening scene.See it! You won't be disappointed!"
" Prestigious!
",spoiler,"The people who hate this film are the smart-arses who point out how children's party entertainers do their tricks. Perhaps if you view ""The Prestige"" forensically, you can predict what's going to happen. To be honest though, what's the point in going to see a film about stage magicians if you're going to pick it to pieces as you watch it?I was able to guess some of the plot twists before they were revealed but that didn't stop me from enjoying this film. I only found myself looking harder, trying to spot the trick. This dark tale of tragedy, rivalry and revenge demands some suspension of disbelief. As with a proper stage illusion, if you're not prepared to look where the magician wants you to then you miss the magic. Spotting the trick isn't the same as seeing the magic, as any children's party entertainer will tell you.""The Prestige"" is highly recommended to lovers of magic and illusion, although persons of a squeamish or overly nervous disposition may wish to leave the theatre before the performance begins..."
" Masterful Film-making
",,"I was fortunate that this movie was still playing at three theaters in my area this week. With junk like Santa Clause 3 and The Return in the theaters, I wanted something that looked truly stimulating.I wasn't disappointed.The Prestige is quite possibly one of the best films of the year. For starters, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Hugh Jackman perform magnificently, and will keep your eyes riveted to the screen. David Bowie was a nice surprise, and the recipient of a makeup job so convincing that my brother and I almost disbelieved it was he. Piper Perabo and Rebecca Hall are very convincing. Scarlett Johansson's performance is somewhat flat, but she makes up for it with sex appeal and flair.Apart from the acting, the effects, sets, and ambiance of this film make for an excellent period piece. I was particularly enamored with the scenes in Colorado Springs. Simply spectacular.I will reiterate the conclusions of the aforementioned writers. This movie is a magic trick unto itself, with the magnificent writing and twist of plot.You too, won't be disappointed if you go to see it. Leave Santa Clause 3, Deja Vu, Bobby, Borat, and Flushed Away in the theaters. If you can get out to see The Prestige, it is well worth it."
" The audience likes to be fooled
",,"As sportsmen say, reaching the top is not the toughest part, but maintaining oneself there. Each new prestigious movie director can say so, and Christopher Nolan is no different. After Memento's clamorous success, in 2000, he's achieved great prestige among filmmakers and the audience. Nonetheless, some disappointing pictures, such as Insomnia and Batman Forever, made his prestige to be questioned. Recovering credibility is a demanding job, and Nolan's The Prestige managed to bedazzle the audience again. As Truffaut once said, cinema is the art of deceiving. Nothing is real, as well as in magic, when the audience is intensely pleased to be fooled. Knowing that, Nolan used magic as the main ingredient of his tasty recipe. And the utterly irresistible result is completed with a mix of great actors (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman as protagonists, plus the terrific supporting roles performed by Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and David Bowie), realistic costumes, gloomy photography and a powerful direction. Not even the presence of the element ""Deus ex ma china"", a Latin phrase used to describe an unexpected, artificial, or improbable character, device, or event introduced suddenly in a work of fiction or drama to resolve a situation or untangle a plot, has managed to spoil The Prestige's magic. If you want to be thrilled by the duel of two men willing to prove who were the best of their professions at that time, this is your call. And don't worry, it's okay to be fooled."
" Once: Excellent. Twice: Masterpiece. Thrice: All-Time Classic
",,"It's quite possible that THE PRESTIGE improves more with repeated viewings than any other movie ever made. As you might have gathered already, there are revelations at the end that force you to reinterpret everything you've already seen. The second time through, it's a different movie. Now, this trick has been pulled off before (most famously by THE SIXTH SENSE), but what makes THE PRESTIGE unique is that our identification with the characters changes once we know what was really going on, and the movie, which on first viewing is flawed only by a slight coldness, becomes profoundly emotional.It's possible that Christopher Nolan (and his screen writing collaborator, brother Jonathan) will never top MEMENTO, because the concept of that movie is so original. But in every other way, THE PRESTIGE is a more accomplished film, and it's so good that it (and its predecessor) actually make an argument for Nolan being the best director since Kubrick. The screenplay takes a justly acclaimed World Fantasy Award-winning novel and, astonishingly, improves it greatly. The screen story seamlessly cuts between three separate time-lines (or four, if you consider the very beginning of the movie) so deftly that you may not even notice how ambitious such a structure is. Unlike MEMENTO, the structure doesn't call attention to itself, but like their earlier movie, it is integral to the story being told.This is (the first time through) a hugely entertaining movie which (on subsequent viewings) turns out to be a deep meditation on obsession, on illusion, on sacrifice, on the nature of art and its audience. It's the best single movie of the last five years (exempting THE LORD OF THE RINGS) and, along with DONNIE DARKO, the best science-fiction or science-fantasy movie since BLADE RUNNER (and maybe since 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY)."
" Incredible
",,"This movie is quite possibly the worst adaptation of a book I have ever seen in my life. Christopher Priest's novel is brilliant, and it has been some time that I haven't been able to put a book down. That being said, this was one absolutely incredible movie.Frankly, I am content with it being a horrible adaptation. Christopher Nolan has taken Priest's genius premise and created another genius story. While I feel sorry for Priests, the Nolan brothers definitely deserve immense credit for a such a difficult task. I was completely engrossed in the film. It ranks, certainly, as one of the best thrillers I have seen, alongside Memento, The Usual Suspects, Fight Club, and some of the great Hitchcock films. It's hard to discuss the plot without giving much away (and a very simplistic storyline can be obtained from this website elsewhere), but I will say that the twists, even if they are already known, are mind-blowing. Keep in mind, however, that this film is a fantasy, or science fiction, whichever term you prefer. The Nolans' script is marvelous, as is Christopher's directing. Michael Caine gives a very good performance, as do all the supporting cast members, namely Andy Serkis' and David Bowie's short roles. The very fact that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are in a film together is enough to see that said film, and they both give outstanding performances (as both usually do). Jackman does an awesome job as a gentlemanly sort of character, consumed by his obsession for the secrets of his opponent. But it is Bale (who stands as my favorite actor) who steals the show (perhaps the last parenthesized quotation reveals a bias). His portrayal of a Cockney ruffian is brilliant, and he, like Jackman, completely assumes the identity of his character. Both are equally deserving of Oscar nominations (and, quite possibly, wins), and it can unfortunately be a rare thing to have two such marvelous actors in the same film doing marvelous jobs. The Prestige is one of the finest films of the year and may unfortunately be out-shadowed by other very fine films. It is an incredible story, one only strengthened by the fantastic performances of Bale and Jackman."
" A highly entertaining film with dozens of twists and turns.
",,"The Prestige tells the story of two magicians, Angier and Borden, who start off working together under another magician. When Borden accidentally (or perhaps purposely) causes the death of Angier's wife, the two go their own separate ways, each becoming famous. A bitter rivalry begins, with each one sabotaging the other, until Borden invents a trick that Angier simply must duplicate, and Angier becomes obsessed with learning the secrets of the trick. This is all I can tell you, because this movie is so filled with twists and turns, that I can't say much else without giving something away.This is Oscar material for sure. In my eyes, The Departed is the best movie of 2006, but this movie is definitely up there. It has an amazing story with twists and turns all throughout. There is not one point in the film where you're not trying to put together some new plot twist. At the end of the movie, when the main twist is revealed, I guarantee that you will have a smile on your face. Christopher Nolan's direction style is very good with this type of movie. Even daylight scenes manage to look dark and foreboding. There really aren't many flaws in this movie. It pulls off being a serious movie as well as a popcorn flick.The acting in this movie is very, and I mean VERY good. Hugh Jackman is awesome as the obsessive Angier, and Christian Bale is amazing as the sinister Borden. Michael Caine is as good as always in the role of Cutter. I really like David Bowie's fantastic portrayal of magical genius Tesla.Overall, this movie is simply amazing, and I'd recommend it to everyone. The acting is great, the direction is great, the story is great, and the twists are amazing. This really deserves some Oscars. See it ASAP.8.5/10"
" Fantastic Movie
",spoiler,"Excellent movie; ingenious plot line, unbelievable twists, and spectacular acting. The name of the movie, ""The Prestige,"" has nothing to do with the level of prestige involved in the magician's competition; it references the third part of a magic trick. Through the course of the movie, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) attempts to discover the secret to Alfred Borden's (Christian Bale) latest greatest trick. There is a mysterious element to the antics of Borden much like the mysteries in an M. Night Shyamalan film. The plot is very complex, and I found that the plot made much more sense after I was able to discuss it with a group of friends who had also seen the film. One unique feature that I very much enjoyed was the strong lack of distinction in protagonist and antagonist. Rivals Angier and Borden both bring in their own share of criminal acts and charitable deeds. The science techniques employed by the characters in the movie are phenomenal, but completely unexplainable. All in all, this movie really gives the viewer something to chew on. I highly recommend it."
" Brilliant. Jackman steals the show!
",,"I saw this the other day and WOW is it good! One of the best films I've seen in a very long time, in fact one of the best films I've ever seen! The film centres on the rivalry between two magicians (Bale and Jackman), and their battle for supremacy and revenge over each other, as well as the mystery of how Borden (Bale) performs the ultimate trick: The Transported Man.Beautifully filmed, with a wonderful script, and some superb performances this is without doubt my favourite film of 2006. For me however the star of the show is Hugh Jackman who is fantastic, and gives in my view his best ever performance. Christian Bale isn't quite on Batman Begins or The Machinist form but still gives an excellent performance, as does Michael Caine. Andy Serkis is great as is David Bowie who really holds his own. There is also a very decent, if not outstanding, performance from Scarlett Johansson. In fact my only gripe about the whole film is the somewhat ordinary performance of Rebecca Hall as Bales wife.Credit must be given to Christopher Nolan for again directing another brilliant film, he really is on a roll, delivering great film after great film: Following, Memento, Insomnia, Batman Begins and now The Prestige, and I have to say this is my favourite.This film is dark and often understated in style, but always beautiful to look at; this really is a bit special. The film often has a slightly melancholy feel about it, but this makes the scenes where the magic tricks are performed even more exciting, I found my heart pumping in the cinema, and a film hasn't affected me like that in ages. The are plot twists galore, and the can be quite confusing and disorientating, so if your not a fan of such things this may not be the film for you.In two words: BLOODY FANTASTIC"
" magically spectacular
",,"I went to see the prestige expecting to see a good movie, what i didn't expect was to be totally blown away by what i think is the best movie I've seen in a long time. as a mater of fact its easily one of the top 5 movies I've seen in my life. The story telling is fantastic memorising you from the very instant to the end of the fantastic dark conclusion. it was great to see finally a movie of this calibre come onto the screen as im sure every one is sick of the rubbish that has been shown of late. obviously once again portions of the movie have been made to try and imitate or copy the powers of steve and steve's powers of the trevix. we must all realise that although many people have tried unsuccessfully, delving into the powers of trevix is dangerous and steve and steve's powers cannot be matched by anyone on this universe or any other... they are genuinely the super powers from the planet trevixon"
" Two Face
",,"""Batman Begins"" 's sequel may not be the one you think it is. If the end of the last Christopher Nolan's picture introduces a new and laughing threat in Gotham City, which will indeed face the Jocker in 2008, it also announces complex narrative ideas, that ""The Prestige"" greatly develops. Inspector James Gordon, portrayed in ""Batman Begins"" like a pessimistic crime philosopher, theorized evil as a mimetic spiral, saying that if justice uses masks, tricks and theatrical fear, like the Batman does, the villains he fights will do the same. The two faces will always imitate them-self, in a perfect symmetry that leads to more elaborated weapons and increase the level of violence. ""The Prestige"", even before this confrontation between the Batman and the Jocker, illustrates Gordon's statement, through the confrontation between two magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman, for those who dreamed about a cinematographic crossover between Batman and Wolverine...) in the dark streets of London in the late XIX century (those who lived there or read ""From Hell"" know what I'm talking about). And of course,as the movie goes on, their fight becomes more and more dramatic, more and more epic, and more and more violent. ""The Prestige"" already transcends Nolan's filmography and could be seen like the artistic apogee of his career (for now on), because it mixes the great storytelling style of ""Batman Begins"" and ""Insomnia"" with the experimental narration and style of ""Fallowing"" and ""Memento"". The film also develops thematics from the previous Nolan's movies, such as the dualism of the characters, which always are in the edge of madness, the obsession which leads to the lost of your humanity, the constant in and go in time, which loses the spectator into the tortured consciences of the characters (but you always understand everything because of the intelligence and the finesse of the construction), etc. This great storytelling, mixed with this accurate style defines what we can call ""narrative realism"". This means that all the realistic elements of the movies only goes to maintain the dramatic progression of the plot and to develops the themes of the movie. That gives the impression that the story and its progression is all that matters in the movie, but that it only works because of the complexity of the style that underlines it : multiplicity of the points of view, intermix of the time lines, suspensions of the revelations, etc. ""Narrative realism"", which can regroups cinematographer like Nolan, but also Shyamalan, creates a new form of modernity, in with the storyline is essential - whereas it isn't in post-modern cinema, as you can experience it with Lynch or Tarantino 's movies. You enjoy fallowing the plot of the movie, but you also take great pleasure in its complex structure, which is clever and modern. In my opinion, such a fun redefinition of cinematographic modernity hasn't occur in American cinema since David Fincher's ""Fight Club""."
" Greatest movie of all time
",,"I am a person that is normally into sports movies and ones with a lot of action and hype. I went with my friend to see this movie who had watched Memento before and said it was good, so I figured he was right because he normally is, and this was directed by the same person so we checked it out. As soon as we started to leave the theater, we both decided this was the best movie that any of us had ever seen and we are going to see it for a fourth time tomorrow. Each time we see it, it stays just as good as the first time. It is the type of movie that you could watch 10 times in a day, and it would be just as good the tenth time as it was the first. I cannot wait for this movie to come out onto DVD. I would buy it at any price they set it at on the very first day it comes out. If you have yet to see this movie, just watch it and you will feel the same way."
" Excellent psychological/sci-fi thriller
",,"'The Prestige' is a classy thriller that appeals to an intelligent audience and is effortlessly one of the best films of the year. Set against the backdrop of a very authentic Victorian London, the film sees two magicians, rich toff Robert Angier and working class Alfred Borden, determined to make their mark in their expertise of thrilling their audiences. But their friendly rivalry descends into bitter, obsessive feud when Angier blames Borden for the death of his wife and relations between them sour to a life-threatening extent.The acting in this film is exemplary but then you expect no better considering the actors involved. Christian Bale plays the cool, reserved Borden who maintains his control in contrast to Hugh Jackman's the volatile Angier, a man whose hatred has turned him from suave to almost unhinged in his fanatical need to trump his rival. Michael Caine brings a calm, maturity to the film as Angier's loyal friend Cutter while relative newcomer Rebecca Hall gives an affecting performance as Borden's loving but increasingly bewildered wife.The setting of 'The Prestige' has clearly been put together with love. Victorian London is flawless in depiction, giving the eerie atmosphere of the darker era where there was a sharp divide between rich and poor, the working class were relegated to slums and jails were hellish. The costumes were wonderful in design, especially some of Angier's suits which do well in enhancing Jackman's aristocratic role.The actual plot is filled to the brim with twists and turns that should satisfy any mystery-lover. Sci-fi fans may piece the puzzle together quicker than those left hanging until the end but this should not put anyone off since what really makes the story is the interplay between Borden and Angier. The animosity-- largely kindled by grief, guilt and masculine arrogance-- is fascinating to see how far two men, who could have had successful lives were there not this feud, go in their pursuit to 'beat' the other. Caine's character Cutter offers nice input in showing how far can one man stand back and watch it all happen before he is forced to intervene. There is also a very interesting ethical debate raised, that I won't reveal in deference to those who haven't watched the film.This masterpiece is highly recommended to those bored of conventional, run-of-the-mill blockbusters and want something deeper for a change."
" Nolan deceives and delights once again.
",spoiler,"Christoper Nolan is a daring, confident and wholly respected director whose cult classic ""Memento"" single handedly established his place in film history. Batman Begins multiplied his fan base, and fired him deep into mainstream recognition with its back to basics, brooding style. Nolan gave Batman the rebirth everyone desired and with it came one of the most widely praised comic book movies of all time. Before cracking on with The Dark Knight, Nolan returned to a project in the making for some time, co-written with his brother Jonathan. Entitled The Prestige the story follows the intense, dangerous rivalry between two turn of the century magicians, adapted from the book by Christopher Priest. After a return to conventional structure with Batman, The Prestige proves a welcome return to the ""What?, Where?, Why?"" syndrome Memento fans embraced. While the timeframe is fractured, the viewer is not plagued with quite the same sense of disorientation; The Prestige is an accessible conundrum of clues and red herrings working together towards the inevitable final grand reveal.On the whole the film is a confident, superbly acted period drama with a unique style that ensures it never quite feels like one. The script is meticulously constructed to mirror the three so called acts of the magic trick, Michael Caine's narration is as warm and welcome as ever. The film does a wonderful job in the first half of conveying the joy (and danger) of the art of the magic trick, effortlessly drawing up a world of misdirection and intrigue as the two protagonists begin to build up a dangerously bitter rivalry, it soon becomes apparent that obsession is the key here. As Bale's Borden is coldly enveloped by his professional career, Jackman's Angier turns increasingly desperate to uncover the others secrets, we realise that this is a deadly, unforgiving pursuit that is quickly spiraling out of control. For the majority of the film we see little of the ""magic"" that wows the theatre audience to whom the act is presented , everything is carefully constructed so our view of each trick is based on the mechanical means by which it is achieved. While you might expect the film to work on the principal of showing you the trick then stunning you with the explanation, this is not the case. Everything is on an emotional level, inside Borden and Angier's lives and minds; this is ultimately a psychological drama.The words ""Are you looking closely"" open the film, good advice for a narrative so tightly convoluted; it is this that will divide audiences. Some will click into the right frame of mind and see the twists coming a mile off and may or may not be disappointed by them. Others will soon forget the warning and settle in for the ride, open to Nolan's misguidance. Either way the final revelations are not quite as ingenious as you might expect, they are certainly not completely unpredictable. Of course the important thing is, are they satisfying? It is a debatable issue, after the initial irritation upon recollection of the multitude of seemingly obvious clues littering the running time your mind may be divided upon how well you take the finale. One revelation even flips the whole genre of the piece on its head, sure to horrify some viewers and please others. This is an ambitious film unafraid of dividing audiences through some unconventional choices.One thing is clear, it is the themes and characters that will stay with you the longest, the multi-layered trickery Nolan reveals may be diverting but is certainly not the pictures crowing glory. As Angier drops down the hatch, for his drunken, vastly entertaining ""double"" to rise the other side of the stage, the camera stays down below with the anguished Angier, desperate to crack the puzzle as the roar of applause is heard just out of his reach. It is a scene that perfectly encapsulates the dilemma he faces, driving him to ever more extreme methods in his obsessive quest to outdo Borden. Visually the film is nigh on flawless, not too ambitious but very distinct. The scenes where Angier visits the pioneering scientist Tesla (a distinctly odd, somewhat amusing performance from David Bowie) on his snowy mountain top are beautifully shot.In the end the two lead characters are so swallowed up in their own ambitions that it is difficult to identify or sympathise with either of them. This is perhaps the films biggest flaw, it is a little too weird, a little too cold. The unique atmosphere certainly secures its place in your memory for weeks to come, the mechanical approach fascinating, but ultimately a little unengaging. The true test will come upon multiple viewings. Will knowing the surprises detract from the mystery? Or will the fascinating psychoanalysis shine through to ensure the film holds up? Only in time can we conclude whether this ascends beyond intrigue towards classic Nolan.8/10"
" A damn good tale, well told.
",,"This movie is a tale. A story. A complete fantasy, but one in which some vital exposé's of what make us all human are on display. The frailties which make us what we are and the sacrifices we'll make in order to get hold of, and hold on to, that which we desire most.I'm not going to relate the plot line here. I will however encourage readers to go see the film. It is an absolute cracker from both an acting perspective and an intriguing, suspense-filled drama fest between the main actors, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale. Michael Caine makes a return to the type of film which suits him most now. The drama genre. A surprise addition and a very, very attractive one too, is the inclusion of a well matured David Bowie playing a pivotal role which makes brief, yet contextually important appearances. Bowie is by far the tantaliser role and a well played one at that.In the style of the director's other films Batman Begins, Insomnia and Momento, time lines are jumbled and the story jumps forward and back between the present and the past. The time shifting doesn't, however, detract from the telling of the story. To the contrary. I found the movement back & forth in time enhanced the movie's ability to entrance it's audience and build suspense. It's the toying with the audience which the director has clearly set out to do, and he achieves his aim admirably. I strongly urge anyone who hasn't seen this flick to do so. You won't guess the ending. It'll leave you stunned. This film rates an 8 out of 10 from me."
" Truly the best film I have ever seen
",,"I really hope The Prestige features heavily at the Oscars this year as it deserves to. It was an absolutely wonderful film that had everything.My very favourite thing about this film was that every little quirk was explained, but subtly, and that despite all the twists and denouements, it remained utterly conceivable and not in the least bit cheesy. The acting was superb throughout, and we were brought back to what was a truly exciting part of English history.Having re-watched the trailer, it is obvious that this would be an ideal film to watch twice as almost every line refers directly and cleverly to something that is revealed later on in the film. Watch it twice, you will see what I mean!"
" Cool, but a little disturbing.
",spoiler,"Want my opinion? This movie is creepy! Me and my friend thought it was going to be about magicians in a like, magical battle. We were sadly mistaken. The movie is about two magicians who hate each other and will do ANYTHING to win this magical battle. People drown, get their fingers cut off in this dramatic battle. There is also this mysterious machine.... In the end the two magicians both were playing dirty acts. Bu only one had the best Prestige...... OK lets get a couple things straight, this is not a magic movie, like real magic. SCarlett Johannson is just there because she is gorgeous. Hugh Jackman is the most awesome actor. This movie is disturbing. It is also creepy. This movie mature, bottom line."
" Two rival magicians escalate the already fierce competition between them.
",,"The plot of was totally enthralling and kept one guessing from beginning to end. The film beautifully captured much of the ambiance of the late Victorian era. At times, the cinematography was incredibly breathtaking, but more importantly, the entire spirit of how tough and cutthroat the competition must have really been for magicians trying to make a name for themselves in those days was readily evident. The characters were superbly acted by all concerned because they were quite believable. In particular, I thought Michael Caine was outstanding as Cutter and I was additionally happy to see David Bowie portray Nikola Tesla.I also enjoyed the fact there was a truly 'surprise element' to it which might prompt people to think about what transpired within the movie on a deeper level. It is very refreshing to see a movie come along that's original in many aspects. The movie was well written and directed, to say the least.I love movies which I can come away with with a sense of something significant having happened which causes me to reflect. This movie definitely fits the bill."
" The Prestige
",spoiler,"I have just seen this eagerly awaited film and have read many reviews so I sat down to watch and make up my own mind about the film. I DID WATCH AND VERY CLOSELY and found myself sitting on the edge of my seat most of the time wondering just where I would not quite get it right. I found the story fascinating and followed it to the end and it was then that I found I had been misdirected at some point - very cleaver.Christopher Nolan's directing and the shared script with his brother was fist class. His next inspiration was to pit Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale against each other - brilliant. Hugh Jackman as the showman who puts his magic across with pure showmanship but Chritian Bale is the better magician but they are friends - but I found him to be evil. But they bounced off each other all the way through and it was a joy to watch such talents on the screen. Michael Caine of course was excellent as ever but I am still confused about all the fuss in respect of Scarlet's acting abilities. I have seen two films and - no - to me she was the limp non person in the film.However, I thought that Hugh Jakman's performance was first class and he changed his main character so much as he started at the beginning of the film has a happy married man with his wife as his assistant but when she died he gradually became bitter, revengeful and obsessed with his magic against Bale because he was sure,and he was right that Bale was responsible for her death. But addition to that he play other characters and each with a difference each with that magical characterisation touch. Christian Bale was good his part but he did not have to progress or diverse as much as Hugh as he was himself and his own brother. He actually was the evil one because he knew he had tied the wrong knot and he was responsible for Hugh's wife's death which began the ultimate feud which would cause death.I was with Hugh all the way through and knew he was not dead - somehow ! Nothing was given away it was just a feeling and when he was shot by Bale it was such a shock I felt myself gasp and shocked this I did not expect.I suppose deeper thought from me should have realised that Bale had a brother because of 'I love you today' or 'Not today' As both magicians were such good friends I cannot understand why Hugh did not know about the brother.However I thoroughly enjoyed the film - I was delighted when it appeared that Bale would lose his daughter to Jackman but she would be well looked after by Hugh but I left the cinema feeling the good guy got the bad deal and the bad guy got away with murder twice - may be even three times really - he did drive his wife to suicide.I fully recommend this film to be seen - it is not complex if you watch it but I cannot guarantee that something will not trip you up and that is the best way a film should be and it is not often we get that delight."
" Obsession and Magic.
",,"I've got to say firstly, Chris Nolan has wow-ed me ever since I saw Memento, all those years ago. He is an exceptional auteur, and wields the conventions of time, space, and suspense like a master... and The Prestige is indeed his masterpiece. Everything from the direction, to the ambiance, to the nuanced performances just sucks you into this world. It is perhaps no coincidence that this film plays like a magic trick. As Nolan manipulates the viewer through his 'pledge', and 'turn'. The artful misdirection within these first two acts, makes the impact of his 'Prestige' even greater.The Prestige is a passionate lamentation on obsession, the likes of which I have not experienced since reading Moby Dick. Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman) is the 'Ahab' of the piece, and Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) is his 'White Whale'... or at least his secret is. Another polished performance comes from Michael Caine, as the ingénue Cutter, who is the 'Ishmael' of this story... And what a story it is.My reasoning behind why this film manages to be so impactful, is because it takes the time to layer every character. No cardboard cut-out, comic book heroes here... Despite having Batman, and Wolverine as the two leads(LOL). This film makes you invest in the characters, and those that go for the journey will be rewarded with something that makes you feel... Which in today's cinema(that has too readily become a 'Snakes On A Plane/Gen Y wasteland'), is truly something special."
" Masterclass
",,"Two friends start out as aides to a popular magician, but soon become professionals themselves. This starts a trek along a path that will lead to rivalry, surprising revelations about their work, betrayal, and murder.Once again, Christopher Nolan proves to be a great director of thrillers. Not just plot wise with the winding and ever surprising story, but with also with the intricate visual appeal and masterclass acting. Like the visual comic book feast ""Batman Begins"" this darkly toned, but highly enjoyable thriller puts you into another world, that feels familiar, but is top-notch escapist entertainment also. The winding plot, which actually incorporates historical and scientific fact, is one of the best in years and will keep you hooked from the first to last scene. Also, everyone has seen little table magic tricks like doves appearing out of nowhere, but this film really draws you in to the world of magic as not only a performing art, but an art of shameless lies and illusion. A world where reality and illusion literally collide and become one and the same.Terrific cast. Terrific script. Terrific direction. Terrific film. 10/10Rated PG-13 for violent content"
" Great Acting & Storyline - Definitely worth watching
",,"I had long been looking forward for this Movie to come out, and I was not disappointed. Right from the opening scene it caught my attention, and it kept it for the duration of the movie.Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale had great performances, and throughout the story I could almost feel the rivalry between them. I enjoyed the way the movie was set out with the mixture of flashbacks and diary entries.I was left at the end of the movie thinking 'Wow'. Although sometimes I think movies can go overboard with the twists and turns, 'The Prestige' has just the right amount to be understood without watching the movie a second time, but enough to leave you wondering on many occasions.Definitely Worth Seeing - It was one of the better movies to be release in a slow year."
" Chris Nolan Does It Again, Bale & Jackman With Brilliant Acting
",,"Because of Christopher Nolan's Brilliant directing and Bales Oscar-worthing acting on ""Batman Begins"", I came to the cinema with huge expectations and they delivered in every possible way.I've never seen such brilliant actors these days with Hugh Jackman and Christian bale doing Oscar-worthy acting.Chris Nolans does it again with a unique direction to the film, the story and script have been clearly had a load of work on so that didn't fail and with so many twists to the story this makes this possibly the best film in a decade. It will face stiff competition from ""Casino Royale"" though 10/10This film deserves a an Oscar"
" Nolan not a one trick magician
",,"My goodness, Christopher Nolan is on a roll, after his stellar, mind-bending debut 'Momento' and his superb Batman Re-invention, Nolan has paused to show his versatility before embarking on The Batman Sequel 'The Dark Knight' to give us 'The Prestige'. It's a dark,almost Shakespearian film about two Magicians, both friend's and rival's, who's passion for the performance of magic turns into a bitter obsession to outwit each other. This obsession becomes a dangerous cat and mouse game of intrigue, jealousy, after a tragic event, but what is illusion in this deadly game, and who is fooling who.The first thing that must be commented on is the magnificent script by the Nolan brothers, complex and impeccably executed. Secondly A superb cast. Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Cain, Scarlett Johanisson, David Bowie, the cast does a magnificent job, particularly Bale and Jackman. Bale in an intense and cold performance, Jackman flawlessly switching from vulnerability to intensity with ease. It's also nice to see Ziggy Stardust himself working those acting chops in a welcome performance, playing against type.I can't recommend this film enough. Intelligent, sophisticated, Hollywood film-making has returned."
" Breathtaking
",,Having watched several movies this year i have to say that so far this has to go to number 1 for 2006 i cannot think of another movie that has made me sit forward in the cinema. Nolan has once more provided another great film and i now eagerly anticipate the sequel to batman begins hoping that he has me edging out of my seat once more. I cannot think of two performances in a movie that contrast so well as Jackman's's and bale's in the prestige and it is a compliment to their skill and the director Nolan. I also have to compliment the ending which was fascinatingly eerie and fulfilled the criteria of the film it was not a failed like that of the departed.
" Fantastic!
",,"""Are you watching closely"". The Prestige is the best film i have ever seen in the cinema. A film which has Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Micheal Caine and Scarlet Johansson is bound to be a shocker. This film is about two magicians trying to be the best by preforming the transporting man trick, but there's a twist. A very good twist which leaves you guessing all the way through. This film is very confusing, but at the end all the questions you had will be answered (hopefully). With brilliant performances from all the cast members this is a film which must be seen by anyone who loves mysteries and magical mayhem. So get up and walk down to your local cinema and watch The Prestige."
" A brilliant take on obsession and misdirection
",spoiler,"We begin, of course, at the end.And then, having seen just how bad things get, we rewind to the start and discover that they started off just as badly.Assistants stride onto the stage, help out with a few tricks, and take their exits. Behind every trick is a technician, levering the mystery into place Meanwhile, our two central characters, both heroes of their own stories, wave their hands in misdirection, causing appearances, disappearances and reappearances, oblivious to the price that even stage magicians must pay.And when we get back to the end, past all of the various detours, distractions, sound and fury, we discover that, well, magic is exactly what we've been told it is, sometimes death can kill you, and sometimes it can set you free.=== It hardly seems worthwhile telling you that Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, David Bowie and a host of others give fantastic performances. Good enough that one of the people I was with didn't recognise David Bowie at all.Or that the Nolan brothers manage to one-up their previous collaboration Memento by presenting a film which, if anything, jumps around in time more, while remaining perfectly comprehensible and remains a mystery simply because we're never quite looking at the clues right in front of us.There wasn't, in fact, an instant, when I wasn't glued to the movie, trying to work out how it was done. But as one of the characters remarks in the film, if you tell people how a trick is done they aren't impressed - it's the misdirection that keeps them coming back for more."
" This movie makes for a real magic act...
",spoiler,"The story is told by Cutter played by Michael Caine and it unfolds a bit confusing at first as Borden (Christian Bale) reads the journal of Angier (Hugh Jackman). Borden is reading of how Jackman is actually reading and translating his old diary of how he wielded his best magic trick ever. A trick that Angier will go to any length to recreate and claim his own.The pair first meet as young men, eager to become magicians in their own right working for a well established magician who likes to play it safe, recreating the tricks of others safely until a cruel twist of fate, and a knot actually claims the life of Angier's young wife in a death defying water stunt. Forever cursing and blaming Borden for tying the knot that may or may not have taken his wives life Angier vows to outdo Borden, even it if means going to hell and back himself.You could never in a million years guess how this film would end. Because the director himself has used the oldest magic tricks in the book to fool us. Mis-direction, disguise, entertaining and good old fashioned humour to divert us from the truth until the end of the movie when the twists, (yes more than one) are revealed. Leaving us breathless and in awe of how good a movie this actually is.Abrakadabra."
" Nolan rules...
",,"Christopher Nolan rules... I have seen most of Nolan's previous work - The Following (mostly unkonwn in this part of the world), Memento (his breakthrough) and Batman Begins. With increasing budgets for each of these films the rich layered texture of his scripts has becomes grander without taking anything away from the script.With Batman Begins Nolan used two great acting talents in Christian Bale and Micheal Cane. Cane is a proved talent while Bale is establishing himself as up and coming leading man (courtesy Christopher Nolan). He has used that combination again with addition of another dependable star - Hugh Jackman.Jackman and Bale are two Illusianists who are learning the ropes of putting up new illusions under the tutelage of Cane, the master illusion builder. Amongst the two Bale is a natural illusionist while Jackman is the natural showman. Their friendship is never really developed or even implied though they are shown to be friendly but always competitive. However an on-stage accident changes all that and turns the competition into rivalry and as the years pass by rivalry turns life threatening.However great the cast maybe the star of a typical Nolan movie is its script. His movies use actors as puppets - like Hitchcock used his actors. The characters come in and say things that are absolutely baffling and at the end of the film all the random straws are neatly tied into place and suddenly make sense.A great film that needs to watched at least twice... I am eagerly anticipating the DVD release of the movie."
" Astonishing!
",,"This film is why you go to the theater and then back and then another time. From the first to the last it delivers. With gorgeous design, utterly engrossing performances it never misses a beat. The brooding and darkness in places are deep but subtle and never overpower the story. I found myself turning the story and characters over and over in mind and even found my dreams influenced. Typically the impact of a film leaves me as soon as I walk out of the theater. I've not felt the impact of film in such a personal way since The Dead Poets Society. My one complaint is the non-linearity of the story in key places. It definitely takes multiple watchings (and multiple eyeballs) to catch all the twists and turns and a rewind control would be welcome. However I feel that to be a slight fault and for the academy to pass this one up without at least a nomination would be a unpardonable blunder."
" Enjoyable but Far-fetched
",,The Prestige is directed by Christopher Nolan and takes place in late Victorian London. The movie is enjoyable but just a little disappointing given the ecstatic reviews. Hugh Jackman (Robert Angier) and Christian Bale (Alfred Borden) play two competing magicians who start out as colleagues and end up as deadly rivals. It's set at a time when stage magicians were well paid and treated like rock stars. Angier is a smooth and polished American with considerable stage presence. Bale is a driven blue-collar type with brilliant and original ideas. Both become obsessed with their rivalry. Jackman enlists the help of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) to develop the ultimate magic trick. Unfortunately the results are unbelievable and spoil the movie.The acting is top-notch with a number of scene stealing performances. Cutter (Michael Caine) helps both men at the start of their careers and later becomes a mentor to Jackman. Scarlett Johansson plays a beautiful assistant who sleeps with both men and ends up disliking both of them. Jackman and Bale play ambitious Faustian characters willing to sell their souls to be the better magician. It's difficult to accept that two intelligent and rational humans could believe that their quest is worth the pain and sacrifice they inflict on others. Ultimately both characters seem flawed and somewhat delusional.
" Cinema Homage
",,"In London at the turn of the XIXth century to the XXth, two young magicians compete to unmask their respective tricks - first moved by revenge, since one attributes to the other the death of his woman, and after by the simple spirit of rivalry, which nothing is capable of pacifying. The trick of the movie: both protagonists have careers as superheroes. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Christian Bale as Batman. What interests most the English director Christopher Nolan (of Amnesia and Batman Begins), however, is the difference of what you see and what you think you have seen - which is, in a certain way, a homage to cinema itself. Besides the great directing, it still has great performances by both Michael Caine and David Bowie."

" Outstanding. Yet another in Christopher Nolan's increasingly heavy bag of tricks that'll leave you begging the question ""How does he do it?""
",,"Obsession, a theme dealt with countless times before, is never one that grows old in narrative cinema. We see it manifest itself in almost every genre, from epic crime sagas like Michael Mann's Heat (1995) to anti-eroticism like David Cronenberg's Crash (1996), such is its generic influence. The Prestige, the latest from wunderkid Christopher Nolan, is a movie very much rooted in obsession, but more importantly how in-human people are willing to go in order to feed there obsession. Hugh Jackman plays Robert Angier, a wannabe-magician, and brilliant showman whose trickster talents are sadly lacking the amazement that Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) enriches his magic with. Borden, meanwhile, lacks the showmanship of Angier, and can only sell his act for its amazement, in spite of its wizardry. Beginning their careers as apprentices, both Angier and Borden work with each other at first, but as is established early on in Nolan's film, their friendship turns to rivalry, and inevitably in death, as the non-linear narrative establishes early on that Borden has been charged with the murder of Angier's character, and sentenced to a jail cell. Yet not is all as it seems, as the twisted nature of the plot keeps the audience firmly on their toes throughout the proceedings.Despite its period setting, very seldom do we get a sense of visual history. Nolan isn't interested in wetting our appetites for milieu, but rather treats this for what it is: a complex character study. It may be 19th century England but that doesn't mean we don't get hand-held camera shots or contemporary music (at least when the credits start to roll). As Michael Caine's character Cutter rightfully points out, ""Obsession is a young man's game"". Both Borden and Angier are willing to sacrifice themselves in order to be the best magician there is. But only the one who never lets up from their act for a second will truly succeed. This obsession is what keeps us, the viewers, guessing from start to finish. We are never entirely sure who has the upper hand in this war of wizardry, which is part of the puzzling enjoyment of this utterly compelling piece of work. The Prestige constantly hoodwinks its audience from beginning to end, with its various twists and turns that, in that Christopher Nolan kind of way, never quite give you all the pieces to the puzzle. But the more he hides from his audience, the more we become intrigued, querying the complex narrative as much as Angier obsesses over Borden's talents.Whilst The Prestige is a complex film at the best of times, the borderline between puzzling and baffling is rarely crossed. In the same way that Nolan's previous masterpiece Memento (2001) took full advantage of the jumpy nature of its unique narrative, The Prestige goes as far as flashing back from within a flash back. It is an instance of cinema that creates enjoyment out of its complexity, rather than sheer confusion, as Nolan manages to unravel the intricate non-linear narrative in a superbly told way. The weight of the performances also plays a part in marking this film's brilliance. Jackman, whose talents had previously been hidden behind flashy special effects, delivers a great performance of a man every bit as obsessed with his work as he is with Borden. Christian Bale is fast emerging as one of the most talented leading men those Hollywood posses. Yet the outstanding performance in the film is arguably Michael Caine, who possesses a tower of screen presence as the adviser and mentor of both men. It is perhaps a shame then that Scarlett Johansson's performance, as the in-between lover of both men, only seems to come alive when her English accent starts to wane. It is not so much a bad performance as it is an inappropriately reserved one, with all her effort in perfecting the London twang draining any weight from her natural screen presence. Yet whatever small quibble one might have of this film is only trivial, as this is clearly one of the best films of the year so far. Whilst the presence of David Bowie is enough to sink any movie, the sheer dramatic power generated by Nolan's film is enough to drown out any flaws, few as they may be, from foiling this magic trick. This is without question one of the best films of the year. Is Oscar watching?"
" The Art Of MAGIC!
",,"The movie captured the art of magic, its complexities and wonder. The characters are rich--they really have something to evoke every audience. They have GREAT MOTIVE... and that's what the audience need-- a reason to stay on the journey of the characters. This fact will put you to the edge until the denouement.What I really liked about the film is that it was presented as such a normal, ordinary plot, just like any other movie in a periodic setting. Furthermore, the director presented the theme-envy, obsession, and deceit, in the coolest way to present these things--SUBTLE! The cast was too good. This film exposes one of the BEST ""RIVALRY"" stories of the decade. I'd have to give it a thousand claps and a HANDS DOWN!There were a few who hated the movie. Yes, it tells nothing about benevolence. Yes, all of the characters are full of deceit and self-preservation. And yes, the director may have over-sensationalized the theme for some (But I think he presented it as subtle as he could). he thing here is that the decisions made by the director works for the advantage of the film. Why would I feel bad if there is not one character who conveyed a positive disposition? The nature of the characters reflects human nature--and as long as a character does that--it is REAL. We should not be looking for a benign protagonist here--besides, that's getting OLD. Films that project NON-CONTRAST between good and evil are marvelous in their own rights. They are laying off the archetypes, the formulaic sense that's been going' on in the film industry for the past 10 years, which should be the case now in the 21st century film-making. AT LEAST THIS MOVIE TRIED, and as far as I know, SUCEEDED."
" The Prestige deserves many prestigious awards.
",,"I was amazed by this movie. Everything is done beautifully from the acting to the set to the costumes. You certainly feel like you're immersed in the story and you've gone back in time to the height of magic. I was a bit surprised by some of the secrets. I won't give anything away, but I'm good at guessing films and this one I only got about 50% correct, which is really low for me. Even if you are completely paying attention, it's sometimes difficult to keep up. I almost wanted to start taking notes in order to figure out what was going on. Every actor is amazing, and the plot twists will keep you on the edge of your seat. I was a bit surprised by the addition of a science fiction element, but it didn't detract from the story in the least. This is a wonderful film, and you'll certainly want to pay attention when the Professor asks ""Are you watching closely?"""
" Wow!!!
",,"It has been a long time since I was as impressed by a movie as I was by this one. Stellar acting by everyone involved, a storyline that makes you think and a very intriguing plot. I'm usually pretty good at guessing the twist ending long before the end, sometimes even before I see the film, but I didn't guess it this time. The casting was just excellent. Everything flowed perfectly. Plenty of twists and turns without seeming ponderous. And the ending was tied up quite neatly, unlike many films that don't seem to know how to wrap themselves up when they have as much to tie together as this one. I can't rate this one highly enough. It is well worth the money paid to see it, and I am more than ready to pay to see it again."
" The Pledge... The Turn... The PRESTIGE!
",spoiler,"From the acclaimed director of 'Memento' and 'Batman Begins' comes Christopher Nolan's latest masterpiece 'The Prestige'. Set primarily in late Victorian London the film encapsulates the era of contemporary science, the world of performance theatre and optical illusion.Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) start off as friends but soon become vicious rivals after the death of Angier's wife midway through a stunt. Angier blames Borden for her death but instead of seeking revenge, he develops a compulsive obsession with Borden's latest magical act: The Transported Man. This leads to the two men trying to out-do each other, resulting in sabotage and murder! The film is full of twists and turns that build up to a dramatic conclusion. Just as you think you've worked it all out, there is yet another twist. Something you could never imagine! Definitely one to watch for anyone that enjoys major twists. 'The Prestige' certainly ranks alongside films such as: 'The Sixth Sense' and 'The Others' in its trickery. However, even if you haven't seen the aforementioned films, 'The Prestige' is chock full of enough realistic special effects, drama, suspense and magic to sate the appetites of even the most picky of viewers."
" A ""Prestige""ous film
",,"The Prestige is a film, ostensibly, about illusion. But, in truth, it is more about maintaining the illusion at all costs, and how that illusion is used as a tool and excuse for the most destructive and obsessive of behavior. Director Christopher Nolan's follow up to the much heralded Batman Begins, The Prestige is not as good as that film, but it is still an entertaining and, at times, challenging romp.Set in the waning years of the 1800s, The Prestige focuses on two stage magicians, Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). They are assistants to another magician, learning the craft, but they are both striving to make their own way in the magic world. After an accident during a performance kills Angier's wife (Piper Perabo), and is ostensibly Borden's fault, the two part ways and begin feuding with each other, sabotaging the other's performances in vicious and violent ways in a constant game of one-upsmanship. When Borden reveals his signature trick, dubbed The Transported Man, Angier, along with assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) and ingenieur Cutter (Michael Caine), develop their own version of the trick, but that isn't enough for Angier, who is convinced that Borden is not using the traditional methods for such a trick (the application of a double, Angier's way),and sends Olivia to spy on him, eventually finding himself on a trip to America to discover the truth of Borden's act.In keeping with Nolan's repertoire to date, The Prestige is a film about individuals who are not the most stable or well-adjusted. These are men who have sacrificed everything, those they love, their health and more to constantly stay one step ahead of the other. The live in a world of illusion, fueled by the desire to keep the other guessing and to hear the thrill of the audience when they have pulled off a good trick. Both Angier and Borden are tragic characters, neither really has much of a bright side, and even when they find some happiness, the pull of their obsession, and other hidden secrets, keep them from enjoying it. You can credit Nolan and his co-writer, brother Jonathan, for not failing to follow this dark subject matter to its eventual conclusion. At the same time, The Prestige is hardly an upbeat film, and these are dark men living dark lives, so it would be easy to see some audience members turned off by the uncompromising nature of this film.The Prestige falls a little short of fleshing out the relationships with Angier and Borden's significant others, in Angier's case Olivia and for Borden, wife Sarah (Rebecca Hall). There is a little more depth to the Borden/Sarah pairing, as she realizes that as much as she loves him, she will always come second to his magic and feud. The relationship between Angier and Olivia is much more shallow, and Johansson proves to have an almost cameo level role, not making much of an impression in the grand scheme of the film.For fans of Christopher Priest's novel, the meat of the story is there, but the modern day framing device has been removed. However, the Nolans have maintained one significant aspect of the book, the telling of a majority of the story through one character's reading of the other's notes and journals. Nolan uses this to play with chronology, as he did in Memento, but not to the same degree as in that groundbreaking film, and the audience should have no difficulty following what is happening.All the actors are in good form, especially Bale and Jackman. They sell the dark feud between these men well, but also their fascination with magic. While Bale has what seems the showier role, Jackman actually stands out greater in this film, playing a role that is a little different than what he has tackled previously. Caine is his usual reliable best as Cutter, a minor character in the novel blown up to a larger part here. The film has a strong, distinguished look that sells the period well, with great cinematography by Wally Pfister.The Prestige isn't Christopher Nolan's crowning achievement, it is a little under Memento and Batman Begins, but overall it is a good show that is worth enjoying. Just don't believe everything you see."
" Wheres the Tricky?????????
",spoiler,"OK so I have to admit that I am a big fan of Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale and well Scarlette Johanssan isn't all that bad to look at either. Oddly enough this movie just sort of crept up on me, hadn't heard much about it till release was right around the corner.Moved to Pakistan a while back so couldn't catch it in the theater and so had to wait till I could land a decent print of the movie on DVD (yes piracy is pretty common in these parts of the world). And let me tell you what a Movie!!!!!!!!!! Although I have to admit that I was able to predict certain key plot points in the movie, how Nolan manages to bring them to the surface is really where this movie stands out.The rivalry is set up well with the accidental death of Perabo's character and then its easy to see how Jackman's quest for revenge soon turns into an obsession with the trick.Its a rivalry of Kane and Able proportions, where although both characters are at a stage where confrontation is no longer necessary, but yet have feel this inexplicable need to hurt the other. Brilliant! Now moving on as soon as you know the multiplication aspect of the trick you know that Jackman's looking to pull a coupe by sending his arch nemesis to the gallows and taking two things most precious to him -his trick and his daughter - in descending order of importance.Alhthough I caught on a bit early into the movie I still was hooked because i was curious to know how everything would play out. There was enough in the movie to keep me entertained until the end, and then it becomes all the More apparent that this is no mere pop-corn entertainer... this is more...so much more...Another thing that stands out is the fact that you really find it hard to sympathize with either character... its tough to pick sides... perhaps Jackman in the initial stages... but over time his character degrades to such an extent to find any justification for his actions is impossible...as is demonstrated by his camp follower Michael Caine's eventual turning.And then the final scene... right at the end when you think its all over... and think that they both got what they deserved... well one of the Bale's anyways... you get a glimpse of something in the box and you leave the theater in my case the home theater in awe and then you put another pack of popcorn in the microwave and head back to the front row seats so a repeat..."
" One of the best of the year
",,"""The Prestige"" is a film about two magicians who are friends at first but when a tragedy strikes, the two split up and have their own magic acts. A rivalry begins between them and from there, the movie twists and turns like a windy road.The acting is the strongest point of the film. Jackman and Bale are both charismatic and extremely likable, although I'll admit I was cheering for Bale (Who wasn't? :P). The plot is well developed and some have complained about the length but when you have a good movie playing, you don't notice the time. Once the movie grabs you, it doesn't let go.Definitely worth the admission price. Go see it, tell your friends, and you'll thank me later."
" Great movie, not for all ages like some others have recommended.
",,"This movie is really well done in a lot of aspects outlined by other posters. However, it is definitely not for all ages. This is the kind of movie that parents will take their third graders to and then their teachers have to listen to them talk about their nightmares for the next several weeks. I work in a school, and it happens more often than you think.If you go see this movie, do your children a favor and leave them at home with a good sitter and a more age appropriate movie. It's rated PG-13 for good reasons. My husband and I had our viewing interrupted by more than one crying child, it was appalling that people would expose small children to a show like that. If you think your kids will be OK with it, go watch it first and decide if the actual content is really OK."
" Brilliant! This movie will haunt you days after seeing it.
",,"Brilliant! This movie will haunt you days after seeing it. While having only a few films under his belt (Batman Begins, Memento, Insomnia), trust Christopher Nolan to produce, write and direct films only of this extraordinary depth and caliber.Another thing to clue you in on how marvelous The Prestige is: the exceptional cast. Premiere cult actor Christian Bale (also of Batman Begins, American Psycho) convincingly switches from ruthless to charming as the richly layered magician Borden that rivals multi-talented Hugh Jackman's suave but obsessive Angier. Michael Caine as their subtly complex assistant, David Bowie as the eccentric inventor Nikola Tesla and Rebecca Hall as Borden's quietly suffering wife all add to the tension, mystery and suspension of disbelief that make The Prestige such a success. Scarlett Johanssen is the only one who unfortunately becomes just the cherry that tops all the eye candy, but her screen presence is unquestionable.This is Nolan's best piece to date: his film-making resonates the magical theme, the dark, moody textures of the period, and the fragmented storytelling. He mirrors the obsessive, fiercely competitive magicians on screen, by showcasing his expertise in using flashbacks and foreshadowing; each framed element carefully placed, everything connecting to the beautifully poignant end.The Prestige hooks you in from the very first scene of the mysterious mountain of top hats; you allow its stunning imagery, characters and storyline to seduce you into its enigmatic world and leave you enthralled but aching for more when the credits roll and the evocatively appropriate soundtrack ""Analyse"" by Radiohead's Thom Yorke stays with you long after your cinematic experience. Nolan's slick sleight-of-hand demo proves that commercial efforts need not be blithe, campy or depressing to also be critically acclaimed."
" The Prestige (2006)
",,"This was a very entertaining movie from start to the finish. I found it hard not to keep my eyes on the screen at all times. Both our main actors Bale and Jackman fit each of their selected identities for their character roles just perfectly. Both show a wonderful talent in their acting and convincing roles in this most enjoyable movie about two magicians out to destroy one another. This movie does have a few nice surprises as it gets deeper into its story, making this one a movie to see for sure. Michael Caine takes what could have been a forgettable role in this movie and elevates it with his demanding screen presence. He did a great job. Probably the most surprising performance comes from David Bowie, with his unforgettable chance to play this role as master physicist, his performance was superior. This is a movie would indeed suggest everyone to see. Most entertaining! ~Angel-X~"
" Great film with excellent performances
",,"The prestige promised a lot.A great director(Christopher Nolan),great actors(Christian Bale,Hugh Jackman,Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson) and a story which sounded very interesting made me to have big expectations.My expectations were at the same level of the movie.The prestige is a great movie which is very fun,interesting and with great twists.All the performances are excellent but the great Michael Caine and David Bowie stole the show.The movie is very well directed by Nolan,a director who shows a lot of talent on every movie he directs.The movie's story kept me interested until the great ending.The prestige is a great movie with a perfect story and excellent performances."
" A mesmerizing masterpiece
",,"From what I read about The Prestige in the paper, I was expecting an exciting, entertaining little movie from one of my favorite directors starring three of my favorite actors. So, rather casually, I drove up to a nearby theater with one of my friends to see it. I didn't expect a cinematic tour de force, but I suspected I would at least enjoy the experience.I can happily say it was the most pleasant surprise of my life. My mind was utterly blown by the dark, beautifully crafted masterpiece that seized control of my senses and not for a moment let go. The plot involves two magicians, Alfred Borden(Christian Bale), and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman), who were once partners but are flung down paths of revenge by a tragic event that may or may not have been an accident. From this relatively simple base, the movie spirals down into the abyss of obsession, competition, and plain hatred in a manner that will keep you guessing towards the end. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale give magnificent performances, aided by a strong supporting cast including Michael Caine and David Bowie(!) Nolan's brilliant directing and Jackman's masterful acting shed light on Angier's obsession that eventually consumes his live, as he desperately seeks to unravel the mystery enshrouding his rival's ultimate act, 'The Transported Man.' The answer to the enigma will drop your jaw and send a cold shiver down your spine. The twists and turns in the deliciously convoluted plot are quite natural, not at all like the cheap gimmickry abounding in the works of M. Night Shymalan.Staged like an enormous magic trick, The Prestige keeps you guessing and, more importantly, questioning. I couldn't stop thinking about what I had seen for several days after I left the theater. The Prestige easily stands as one of the best movies of 2006. I sincerely hope it is given some serious consideration for some Oscars. In my mind, only Zhang Yimou's 'Hero' strikes me as a better movie."" Are you watching closely?"""
" Not your typical illusion show.
",,"The Prestige/2006/***Main Stars: Michael Caine Hugh Jackman Christian Bale Scarlett Johansson Rebecca HallChristopher Nolan's The Prestige is brilliantly unexpected! When I saw previews for the film, I knew the movie was about intense, intriguing illusions. Illusions so intense that the one performing it might die right in front of the audience or make YOU walk out of the theater. But I can take intense scenes in movies. This one was one of the most intense films I've seen this year! I could hear and feel my heart wanting to escape my chest. Actually, at the end of the film I think my eardrum was damaged. The film was that loud at least during one of the many illusions. One that had the biggest mystery. One that was supposed to have more than just a) the pledge (taking something ordinary and showing it to everyone) and b) the turn (that one ordinary thing becomes something extraordinary). It had to have the most important something. Something that's not just important, but is very difficult to perform. That's c) THE PRESTIGE. That one illusion actually resulted in the climax and resolution of the story so why should I tell YOU? You would kinda predict the climax though after seeing the illusion. At least I did. But everyone's different. The story takes place in London, England. It takes place in the bad parts of London. You might not notice that from the previews. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are competing magicians who both seem to have a lot of talent in magic. You would think that this competition is peaceful. Well change your thoughts now because it's not. Robert and Alfred are both vengeful people and are both hungry for audience attention. So they both compete and compete with each other. They both hate each other, might I add. They were friends before that until they became hungry for more power over the other. Friendship that became a rivalryRivalry that became a battle. This is an excellent and very true tagline for the film, which brought me to the prediction that this film will be pretty intense, and that's the reason why I didn't run out of the theater after seeing some intense scenes. What is even worse about the competition between these two maniacs and their hunger for attention and power and better magic is that it's interfering with their family. Robert and Alfred both start out with wives and Alfred ends up with a kid. Robert does not. But does Alfred really love his wife (Rebecca Hall) or does he love Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson), a woman who works for show and as eye candy in both Robert's and Alfred's department? Maybe he likes neither; maybe he likes both. Usually movies answer your questions. You have that question? See the movie. Then there's Robert who's more of a mystery than Alfred is because he seems to have more on his mind and can't get it out clearly. But you'll find out what his plan is. In my opinion, Alfred is worse than Robert. To not be so blunt, I'll specify it a little more. He's worse in the way of how violent he is and what he does is terrible, and I think he caused Robert to be that way. He influenced him to be as violent as he is. Plus, he may have been influenced by his manager Cutter (Michael Caine) who really pressured him and wanted the best of the best out of him. And to think this movie is supposed to be about magic and friendly competition and the magicians reading each others diaries and tricking each other with odd codes and twists and turns that might take years to decode. The decoding of diaries was actually in the movie. But it's not that way in this film. The Prestige has more than just a stupid illusion show; it has a good illusion show and it has a good background story. It shows how messed up some people get when they want attention and that turns into a plausible, intense thriller! Movie directed by Christopher Nolan."
" The best fill of all time
",,"...Okay I know thats saying much but I mean it... I have watched a lot of movies, new and old. Like most anyone, I really like this movie. I'm not sure why it was rated PG-13...but then again it couldn't as well have been rated PG.... but I saw nothing in it that was PG-13 Worthy... Seeing how mostly PG-13 movies now and days can slip one ""F"" word in the movie... I was searching hard to try and find this one... and I could not. I do remember hearing a few words but no one seems to really care about it as much. But as for the speech that was good. The story was great! It kept you guessing and wondering what was going on. I love that aboot a movie!! :) I was on the edge of my seat the whole time... the story was just amazing and left you so ... just amazingly lost!!!If you love magic or love to know how things are done.. Here is a great twist for you...watch and fall in love with the thrill and mystery of the whole movie!... In Short... I love love LOVE the Prestige!"
" Surprisingly Excellent film
",,"Although The Prestige never really becomes a fast paced film until the climax, it isn't too slow either. More of a ""comfortable"" pace. It tells the story of two competitively good-natured magicians beginning their careers at the turn of the century. Their mutual respect soon turns to a bitter rivalry which escalades to dangerous levels.Excellent acting all around, most surprisingly (at least to me) from David Bowie. A potentially confusing plot comes together seamlessly, leaving all your questions satisfied by the end. Many films like this can leave the audience confused if they weren't keeping a close eye on every scene, but The Prestige does not not suffer from this. Of course the keen observer will find the ending far more satisfying than the casual moviegoer, but the latter won't be left in the dark on anything. Indeed, this film rivals The Shawshank Redemption in terms of tying up loose ends."
" One of the best EVER....seriously!!!!
",,"I went into this film a bit apprehensive, I can't lie. Having enjoyed Nolan's first two films immensely, being slightly disappointed by his third ( though I have this feeling I need to give it a second chance) and totally digging his fourth.come one Bale as Batman it's a no brainer! Needless to say I didn't quite know what to expect. Part of me felt this was a little side film in the interim between Bat flicks (stupidI know that now) Part of me was hoping he hadn't completely gone Hollywood. Literally 30 seconds into The Prestige and all doubts just floated away. Nolan is back in a big way, and I cant emphasize this next statement enough.if you haven't seen this film get off you're a$$ right now and see it. Stop reading this review and just go!! What can I say? I was utterly blown away by this film. Everything was amazing about it, the story ( who knew a film about magicians could be this good), the cinematography, the editing/pacing, the performances all top notch. It is a film that is at least on par w/his previous work and arguably his best so far. One of the best times I've had at the movies everand I see a lot of films. You see I went in not knowing much other than this was a new Nolan film and the cast. I hadn't even a seen a trailer yet. Perhaps this was why I was in such awe of the story. Though that's not it entirely, the story combined with its non linear presentation has this way of grabbing hold of you and not letting go until the finale. The structure is brilliant, with out giving to much away the film is for the most part told from journal entries being read by the films two leads. The story is told in a non-linear fashion that is a bit confusing but you will quickly get a a handle on things. Or maybe I'm just slower than everyone else lol. I could go on forever about how ever aspect of the film was brilliant but that would just be time your not watching the filmand quite honestly if you've already seen it then you already know. Or maybe you don't and you think I'm a complete dork for digging this silly film about magicians."
" A Tremendous Roller Coaster Ride of Twists and Turns
",,"I recently saw the Prestige with a few of my friends and i was blown away. Right from the beginning this film grips you with a very powerful opening scene that is the climax of the story i thought this was unusual at first but then it went into flashbacks and flashbacks and flashbacks telling the story of 2 rival magicians. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine bring incredible performances. One of Christian Bale's best same goes for Jackman. This movie starts out with a bunch of loose ends in the story and gradually these ends are tied and revealing more of the story. They reveal little pieces of the story to you throughout the film and they are brought to a close at different times. This keeps the film very intriguing at all times seldom does the story slow down. tony Scott has outdone himself in this film. The camera works is beautifully done and the locations are perfect.I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS FILM IT IS A MASTERPIECE AND SHOULD NEVER BE OVERLOOKED."
" Even if you figure it out before the end, it's still fun to watch.
",,"Without the knowledge that the director is trying to deceive the audience, you wouldn't have the large contingent of people saying ""I figured it out, so it's not worth watching."" I figured out the ending of this movie before the movie ended. Well, I figured out most of it; there are a few twists and turns that you pretty much can't predict. The beauty of this movie is that, even when you've figured it out (and you might, if you try, but where's the fun in that?), watching two dudes be completely obsessed with a competition--and with revenge--remains compelling.Other complaints--that the characters are cold--gets at the very nature of obsession. One of the many brilliant facets of this movie: three-dimensional characters Become one-dimensional as they are consumed by their obsession.In summary, holy crap this movie was awesome."
" synopsis
",spoiler,"Surprisingly, the Prestige kept my attention until the end. I thought it would be a decent movie but it definitely was better than I thought it would be. The basic plot surrounds two magicians Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). The two start out working together but end up enemies after Angier's wife dies following a botched magic trick. Angier blames Borden for his wife's death claiming Borden tied the wrong knot that led to the drowning of his wife. Borden goes on to start a family and a solo magic act. He creates a trick I'll call ""the reappearing man"" where he bounces a ball then walks through a door and reappears through another door about 20 feet away and grabs the ball as it bounces past the 2nd door. Angier, who with the help of Cutter (Michael Caine) and Olivia (Scarlett Johansson-basically only used for sex appeal), creates a magic act as well. After watching one of Borden's shows, Angier is convinced that Borden uses a machine to transport himself from one door to the other. Despite Cutter's insistence that Borden uses a double, Angier becomes obsessed with discovering Borden's secret. The rest of the movie follows Angier and his devotion to figuring out the secret to Borden's most popular trick. The climax of the movie is filled with several compelling twists and turns and ultimately some unanswered questions. Overall, this was an above average thriller that was able to incorporate magic in a semi-believable way. SPOILER:For example, it was unclear whether Borden really had a twin or if he too, like Angier, was able to duplicate himself using the machine Tesla created."
" Movie Magic
",,"""Are you watching closely?"" is the watchword for The Prestige. Like the magic tricks portrayed within, the movie demands you watch closely.Christopher Nolan employs the same non-linear style he used in Memento and, to a lesser degree, in Batman Begins. Watch closely or you may get lost in the film's many flashbacks and plot twists.If you pay attention however, you'll be rewarded with a riveting tale of obsession, impressive visuals, and remarkable performances.See this one on the big screen. Although I will buy the DVD when it's released, this is definitely not a movie you can play in the background at home. I recommend it highly!10/10"
" Phenomenal...Simply Phenomenal
",,"There are few movies throughout the world that can really give you a great show and this is one of those films.The prestige is one of the few films that i have really grown attached to as i was watching it. It provided an excellent and powerful plot and Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, and Michael Caine had truly proved that they are some of the very best actors in the acting industry today. It is those three actors at their very very best. I do however, have to admit that it was one of the most confusing movies i have seen but after watching it a second time I got exactly what had happened. But if you truly want to see a great movie and you are a big fan of magic tricks I strongly suggest that you see this movie as soon as possible."
" The Intrigue of ""The Prestige""
",spoiler,"""The Prestige"" by Brian Murphy""The Prestige,"" a Victorian-era set film about dueling magicians, is much darker than ""The Illusionist,"" the recently released magician film starring Ed Norton. It is a startling, sometimes violent study of rivalry, jealousy and obsession. Deftly directed and sharply written (along with his brother Jonathan Nolan) by Christopher Nolan (""Memento,"" ""Batman Begins""), the story follows the lives of friends-turned-rivals Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale). Their unrelenting quest to be the best has profound effects on their entire adult life. ""The Prestige"" hooks us right away, with an intriguing shot of a hill littered with top hats. Without explanation, the multi-narrated film begins its first voice over as trick contraption designer Cutter (Michael Caine, terrific again) describes the three stages of a magic trick: The pledge, the turn and the prestige. The devious Nolan brothers have crafted their story to play out with a magic trick, setting out to trick us at the film's end. Despite some meandering scenes and revenge plots that may eventually seem repetitive, when the final surprise is finally sprung, the effect is chilling, whether we have guessed the outcome correctly or not. Narrative structure is bent, as past, present and future become a multi-layered collage that Christopher Nolan expresses with stunning clarity. Whatever points in Robert's or Alfred's lives are given screen time are distinguished with ease, whereas a lesser director would have muddled them. Robert and Alfred, apprentices working for the same magician. Despite a cordial rapport, both seem to have different ideas about what makes a good magic trick, with Alfred always seeming to have the idea of pushing things further. After ignoring Cutter's advice for how to tie a knot proper for Magician Assistant Julia, the woman dies in a water tank, and Alfred is responsible. Julia was Robert's wife, thus spawning the heated, perhaps even murderous rivalry that is to comprise the rest of the film. The Nolan Brothers have done their research, dissecting several, intricate magic tricks and revealing them to the audience. From the ""Bullet Catch"" to the ""Disappearing Man,"" all angles are dispelled, and Robert and Alfred stop at nothing to sabotage their enemy from completing either trick. Even the bit players offer some spice, such as Scarlett Johansson as Robert's assistant Olivia, who may or may not be playing one side against the other. Rebecca Hall is outstanding as Alfred's wife, Sarah, her performance reminiscent of some of the outstanding, tough performances given by many of the women on HBO's ""Deadwood."" Sarah's feelings towards Alfred begin with intrigue, melt into love, and almost slip into madness trying to understand Alfred's split personalities-loving husband one day, obsessed magician the next. The lines in this film are as shadowy as Wally Pfister's cinematography, where our allegiance is deliberately forced to shift from one magician to the next, a testament to both good writing, and to the outstanding performances of Mr. Bale and Mr. Jackman. Both characters are, at times, valiant heroes and vile villains. Like ""Memento,"" picking apart the plot of ""The Prestige"" may uncover some holes, but the overall effect is an exhilarating whirlwind of mystery, suspense and shocking revelations that are bound to have audience members discussing motives and theories long after the credits have stopped rolling."
" Keeps you engaged and you'll want to see it again
",,"Christopher Nolan does it again. Like Batman begins the story is very well written and I did not want to leave my seat for any reason. The movie was well cast with two of the Batman Begins actors, it was a great choice of talent.I truly enjoyed this movie. It does have a longer runtime than most movies, but I wasn't checking my watch to leave. I definitely want to see this movie again.I found myself trying to pay such close attention to see how tricks were done and figure them out that I likely missed something. I'm sure there were small details that I did not notice. Like the previous reviewer there were some confusing things with how the seasons changed drastically. Watching the movie again may help me understand.I won't speak to the story line as I really recommend you see for yourself and it was worth the $9.50 and I will pay it again."
" great movie! """"must see""""
",,"This was an EXCELLENT movie!! One of the best I've seen. This is my favorite movie of all time. With suspense, unpredictable plot, and a touch of romance has made this movie a movie for every type of person. If you already love Christian Bale this movie will make you love him even more. The writers are absolute GENIUS'S!!! They wrote this movie amazingly! Even throughout all the twists they made it perfectly plausible and fairly easily understood. I think I'm going to write to the writers congratulating them on such an EXCELLENT movie. Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Scarlet Johannson, and Michael Caine, did a SUPERB job. They timed everything perfectly, and the emotion was entirely believable. There were multiple quotes that I will remember for a very long time they were just so GOOD! On the drive home after seeing this movie you will just not be able to stop talking about it. Throughout the seemingly serious plot, there are several parts that will just make you laugh out loud. All in all this was a SUPERB movie!! Not one even close to being as good! TWO THUMBS UP!"
" Great Movie
",,"throughout the whole movie i was extremely confused and I'm still confused right now about it. however, the movie is wonderful. with the bits and parts that i do understand it is an absolutely amazing movie with so many twists and turns that will keep you on the edge of you seat until the movie is over and the crowd has shuffled out.The acting is wonderful and the directing makes you feel as if the movie is written just for you.i highly recommend this movie to anybody who is in the mood for a twist and a movie that requires a lot of thought, but yet a lot of excitement at the same time."
" The Ultimate Magic Trick
",,"""The Prestige"" is easily the best film in the last two years.I've seen it twice so far and I enjoyed it more the second time around because many of the scenes that had seemed flawed the first time around are actually very important to the plot.""The Prestige"" is a magic trick unto it's self. It actually has two twists and both are revealed in the first few minutes of the film and are continued to be revealed throughout; but still, we are surprised by the ending.I don't want to give anything away, so just be sure to watch carefully. Then go back and see it again and if you pay very close attention, you will see that everything actually fits into place perfectly.My pet peeve with Hollywood is that they spend $200 on special effects but don't bother with writing a decent script. The script for ""The Prestige"" was obviously thought out and re-thought until it was flawless. If you don't fully understand the ending, you can read some of the message boards on this website to have it explained.After ""Momento,"" I had expected great things from Christopher Nolan. ""The Prestige"" is the film I had been waiting for."
" New thoughts on the Borden/Fallon argument....
",spoiler,"First of all, I didn't want to write twin/clone argument in the title because of the spoiler aspect......without having seen the movie, my title above doesn't mean anything to anyone glancing at the comments' titles which inevitably happens.I have read quite a bit about the argument between the twin and the clone of Borden/Fallon argument and I am leaning towards the clone angle. I have a lot of speculation that helps my theory and I look forward to responses.My absolute main reason for writing this is because I have a hard time swallowing the coincidence of Borden sending Angier on a wild goose chase halfway across the world to get some goofy flashing lights stage prop.......and then that same person being the ONE SINGLE PERSON IN THE WORLD who could have also coincidentally provided the entire cloning device solution and given Angier what he wanted in the first place... Now most of the evidence in the movie points to this theory and I can accept that.....but for me, it makes the movie far worse than I expect it to be. I mean, come on....we see coincidences in movies all the time, but they are more along the lines of two people passing each other on a street or groups of individuals all converging on a single spot at the same time..........but here we are led to believe that the protagonist {sort of} (Borden) sends the antagonist {again, sort of} (Angier) to the one single individual capable of solving his request when it was really meant to be a diversionary tactic to get Angier out of the country??? Come on.......that's too much for me to swallow. So here's some of my arguments against the other arguments out there in favor of the ""twin"" angle.First of all, I feel that Borden has had prior dealings with Tesla in some form or another. When Tesla is in England giving his demonstration, Borden seems to be the only calm one there, meaning he knows the lightning and experiments are harmless....at least the ones being shown at that time. Normally, he should have been as cautious as everyone else and left...if he was a normally sane person...which can be argued.Secondly...his clone could have come from a couple of years ago...OBVIOUSLY before his hand was maimed. And in doing so, he has to do the same to the clone's hand.Twins, at best, are still brothers. And we are supposedly led to believe that the twin brother (Fallon) has given up his whole life...his ENTIRE IDENTITY...for the sake of the other brother's magic show? The idea also that there's absolutely no difference in them other than the hand issue (during that point in their lives) which they end up fixing by chopping the others' fingers off, says that they are SOOOO identical that even the wife and girlfriend and others around them can't figure it out? Twins who live and grow up and experience different lives, or even similar existences, still exhibit physical differences, if nothing else but cuts or scratches leading to scars the other one might not have due to sheer different physical experiences through life. Also, the idea that the personalities are different can be explained by this same theory.....that the clone finding out he is a clone could exhibit a darker personality (maybe even a side effect of the cloning?) that would lend itself to the different personalities that come from living slightly different realities, even though the lives are nearly identical. Surely the darker personality would start holding resentment for ever being cloned....or maybe it's the opposite.....maybe the darker personality is the original Borden and the clone is a more ""innocent"" version (like an infant or a clone that is newly born) that lacks the dark tendencies....who knows. But if the clone is a couple of years old regardless of which personality it is.....it could exhibit a slightly different personality than the original strictly due again to different daily experiences through environment and luck among other reasons.CONTINUED IN PART TWO"
" Christopher Nolan Does it Again!
",,"I have long been a fan of Christopher Nolan's Memento and Batman Begins, so I was expecting very much from this film. Not only were my expectations met, they were surpassed. The genius of this film tied in with the subtle nuances of cinematography and signature Nolanisms (voice overs) created a masterful work truly worthy of the title The Prestige. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Andy Serkis, David Bowie and Scarlett Johansson all performed wonderfully with each actor fully melded with their on-screen persona. Once again Nolan is a master of time and he uses this to a great advantage in a similar fashion to Memento. Without a doubt, this movie is recommended with two thumbs way up. Missing this spectacle would be very unfortunate."
" An intense, visually magical, emotionally charged piece of work
",,"The visual experience of this extremely authentic period piece, consummate acting and storyline will leave most earnest moviegoers with a truly exhilarating experience. You expect the leading actors to do something familiar from their other work but they give us new dimensions. Michael Caine again proves his timeless value to the enhancement of any role while David Bowie offers a portrait of elegant, aged sophistication fronting electrical spectaculars, ancient reminders of Ziggy Stardust. Although the film has slower expository moments, the contribution to the grand finale is something to behold. If magic is what you wish for, magic is what you will receive. The name only belies the true ""Prestige"" of the final act. There are facets that make this film watchable with a repetitiveness that will seem tireless. It can and will involve a satisfaction and identification of inner emotions that are played out and identified by all of us. The film can easily define the recently modern terminology ""obsessive-compulsive"" behavior. It also can serve as a guide on the price of success at any cost affecting so many of our fellow human beings today. For those who scrutinize detail, there are scenes of turn of the century London you will find irreconcilable with modern sanitation and relative cleanliness of large cities. The artifacts, apparatus, equipment, and scenery seem to have been crafted with such exact precision as to have been transported from history. The character of Nicola Tesla was real and a real genius overshadowed by Edison; Tesla and elements of his work are still shrouded in mystery to this day. In summation, this movie is magical and a fulfilling treat for those with imagination and the absolute enjoyment of carefully merged fact with unknown possibilities."
" Oscar Worthy!!!!!
",spoiler,"So far this year, I have seen only about 3 movies that deserve the best picture nomination, this is one of them. (Just in case you were wondering the other two were the Departed and Flags of our Fathers)The Prestige delivers a mysterious, dark tone that is carried out through the entire movie, especially near the ending. It goes from being a typical success story which makes you choose sides almost emediately, rooting for Angier (Hugh Jackman), because his character gets the most screen time, and we feel sympathy for the loss of his wife. We follow him through his journey to discover what Alfred's(Christian Bale) secret is for his teleporting trick. This takes him to Colorado where he meets a scientist who provides Angier with a machine that somehow duplicates objects, for a great price of course. This is where it gets really interesting. The character of Alfred is clouded in mystery almost the entire movie until the bitter climax, when you find out his true secret. I would give this movie a 9 just for the great ""tone"" this movie sets, but add a great suspenseful story and you've got a masterpiece. Unfortunately this film doesn't add up to classics like ""Silence of the Lambs"" or ""The Godfather"" so I can not give it a ten. But for what its worth its one of the best movies of the year, so go see it and enjoy!!!"
" Great Adpatation, Entertaining, Keeps You Thinking
",,"Having read the book by Christopher Priest, I was looking forward to how this story would translate to the big screen. I was not disappointed.Overall, we the core elements of the novel version: a story of two magical acts who are obsessed over a single trick and their drive to continually outdo and sabotage each other. This obsession drives them to lose loved ones, forgo their humanity, and in the end, commit murder.The film layers on twist upon twist, with plenty of foreshadowing and a clever dual between the characters via their diaries. While the earlier magic-themed release of ""The Illusionist"" was an elegant period piece with a single twist, this film delves into the darker nature of humanity, and what it means to be truly obsessed. Both versions of the trick ""The Transported Man"" will keep you thinking for days, and you will find yourself asking ""would I have done what they did to perform the greatest trick in the world?""This film will definitely find a place in my library upon DVD release."
" Prepare to pay attention to every detail...the film is a trick in itself..
",,"Prepare for non-linear, plot twisting writing. The film is shot in a 3 act fashion which is the secret formula to a great film whether non linear or shot in order. The acting was superb and the character development fully fleshed out all the characters most importantly Bale and Jackman as two competitors in show business in Vicorian era London where the beautiful costumes and set design transport the viewer there in the middle of early metropolitan media hyped civilization. Sometimes a showman is in the business strictly to hear the applause of a crowd, to feed the ego. A showman will go to desperate lengths to be # 1 on the billboard charts or in this case invent the best magic trick in a time when magicians were as popular as pop singers and rock stars. But what if the magic trick is not magic as we know it. Magic is a trick. But real magic is science.The film is not a realistic revenge drama/mystery. I suggest you walk into the theater prepared to see a Science Fiction film. The movie can deceive you into thinking it's a serious factual film. The film is never boring though. To me at least being a huge Twilight Zone and Star Trek fan. The characters really hate each other, and you feel their envy, hatred and jealousy in every scene. The only problem with the film is that it shifts from realistic revenge drama to a long twilight zone episode after the midway point, which can cause some audiences to be let down or disappointed . Love it or Hate it film. But it's not easy disregard the smart script, off guard plot twists, and great acting. Spiritual religious people and Science fans will love the story because of the hope we get from realizations that humanity can achieve when all the bad emotions are tucked away. Science heals and science kills, but it all depends on the soul of the man who controls the science. 3 1/2 stars. 7/10."
" Extremely interesting & intriguing movie
",,"This movie was simply fantastic and gets you thinking about it long after you have walked out of the theater. Not only was the story awesome, but the photography, acting etc was also great. Nolan has again played with the timeline while unraveling the story. ( ..as he had in Memento )It begins with Bale reading a diary written by Jackman. Thats the present. The diary he reads sends us the past in which Jackman comes across the diary of Bale. That is the past. This diary which Jackman is reading sends us one level further into the past. All these 3 timelines run throughout the movie. As the story unfolds, it gets more and more interesting until finally we are hit with the climax , right in the present , offering all the answers to the mysteries of all the 3 timelines !!!! Just simply EXCELLENT !!! I give it 9/10 ! The performances were really great. I think Hugh Jackman has done a fantastic job. Bale is pretty good as well."
" Go see it now before spoilers get out!
",,"Run, don't walk, to your nearest cinema.See ""The Prestige"" NOW before a handful of idiots ruin the movie by giving away its secrets (much like ""The Crying Game"" and the more recent ""The Sixth Sense"").There will always be those that ignore common decency and will post or tell the 'tricks' behind the general movie magic and tricks of the film.The Prestige deserves better. It deserves to be seen untainted. Don't read the reviews or discuss it with anyone... just go see it. Chris Nolan is a brilliant director and the acting (especially the supporting cast) and production is top notch. Your brain will spin trying to figure it out... but in a good way."
" The Prestige:You'll be talking about it long after it's gone.
",,"The Prestige - Christopher Nolan's latest collaboration with Christian Bale in which magicians in turn-of-the-century London who battle each other for trade secrets. The rivalry is so intense that it turns them into murderers. Hugh Jackman plays level-headed showman Rupert Angier to Bale's unpredictable but brilliant magician Alfred Borden.The performances are very good all around. I caught Scarlett Johanessan's fake British accent slip same as Natalie Portman's (V for Vendetta) once or twice. They must've had the same voice coach. Bale is sinister, seemingly omnipresent and omniscient, and usually the most watchable character on screen, though Hugh Jackman makes for excellent competition as a man getting down and dirty as he gives up all in a bid to be the best magician. Michael Caine is charming and talented support as always. I didn't even recognize David Bowie as Nikola Tesla; he was almost the real Prestige (unveiling of third act in a magic trick) of the film The tricks, while not as fantastic visually as in The Illusionist, are much more realistic and there is more of a desire to see them unveiled. The cinematography and scripting are top-notch, and the film has the wonderful dis-jointed yet well-paced quality that has come to be a trademark of Christopher Nolan. The film has some genuine suspense to it, and I can't tell anymore about the plot than this, but nothing and no -one is what it seems. The entire film is a magic trick, and the denouement is infinitely more satisfying, weighty and horrifying than that of The Illusionist. For a film titled after the shocking climax of a magic trick, this ending does not disappoint. The only question is whether the film is worth more than one watching. It also was a bit long, though I'm damned if I could figure out what to leave from it. Still, it'll undoubtedly be in my top ten of this year, so I'll give The Prestige an A."
" Masterpiece of allegorical fiction
",,"This movie works on many levels: and thats what makes it great.The Prestige is a roller-coaster ride, a sweeping tale of intrigue and malice as one magician tries to one-up the other and vice versa. Twists and turns abound, possibly even some loops, as the movie approaches an inspired climax that doesn't waste the previous hours the viewer spent watching the movie (*cough* Shyamalan *cough*). Like Mement, another Christopher Nolan masterwork, this is a movie that will keep you thinking long afterward. Not only must the viewer come to grips with the winding plot but he or she can also ponder the concepts driving the details. For me, this was a movie about identity, what people do to stay elusive and one step ahead of your competition, not to mention the results thereof. It still amazes me the little details I can remember and place meaning upon that I didn't really think much of at the time. I would put examples, but the best ones I can think of are plot spoilers (and I wouldn't ruin the movie for my good readers).A few of my friends thought this movie was a bit too long though they still enjoyed it. As for me, I thought it the perfect length. There wasn't a moment wasted throughout.The Prestige follows through with top-notch performances by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Michael Caine with well-done performances by the ladies and other supporting cast members as well."
" A terribly Disappointing Film
",,"The fact that this movie has received 8.6/10 is simply verification that theses ratings mean nothing. This is one of the most unnecessarily convoluted, poorly-acted film i've seen in theaters for a long time. The dialog is implausibly modern, the relationships do not take into account sex relations at the time, the the twists and turns are manufactured in a spirit of dues ex machina. Like ""The Illusionist"" before it, the twists in plot are not earned but sloppily thrown in, and even worse- boring and clichéd,save the final one, which is just stupid. The final scene is so melodramatic, long winded, and ridiculous, I considered leaving the theater- but regretfully chose to stay in hopes of some kind of redeeming quality emerging. The only one found was the long overdue appearance of credits. I'm not biased, I like Christopher Nolan's earlier works- Momento and the under looked Insomnia are both excellent- but his writing, has become very short sighted and melodramatic- Batman Begins was also poorly written, failing to cross the line into either comic book/ graphic novel fictionalized or cinematic realism. The emotional connections in this film are not developed, but like the twists lazily thrown in (particualry the relationships with women). It's the second worst film about magic this year."
" The Prestige? The Pathetico sounds better.
",,"A trick is only as good as its execution. That is certainly something the director, screenplay writer and the editor should have taken away from this movie. Seems like Chri Nolan decided to direct the movie simply because the novel was written by his namesake. After a wonderfully scripted and executed ""Batman Begins"", Nolan's latest offering comes as a huge disappointment. The premise of the movie, from the very onset, seems to be to dupe the audience into thinking something different when the truth is right in front of their eyes. The story tries hard to avert you from the truth by throwing twists and turns but once you know the secret it really is hard to appreciate all the Coloradon beauty and the precise sets.Acting wise, Hugh Jackman is in top form and I can't wait to see him in The Fountain. Michael Caine comes across as the Jack Nicholson of his kind of roles - he will never go out of fashion. Bale and Johansson play their roles aptly. A tighter editing with a more hidden suspense would have made the movie better. Earnings of 14M for the opening day seem to say it all."
" Cloning technology comes to turn-of-the-century Victorian England
",spoiler,"Adapting the novel which ""The Prestige"" was based on was no easy feat. The film's scenarists, brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wisely jettisoned the subplot from the novel set in the present time which chronicled the machinations of the descendants of the two principal characters. The Nolans also should be congratulated for turning the novel (which features separate diaries of the principal characters written in the first person) into a more coherent third person narrative. Some of the first person diary narration is retained in a series of voice overs but it's not overdone thus preserving the flavor of the novel.'The Prestige' concerns the running battle between the two well known stage magicians in turn of the century Victorian England, Borden and Angier. In the novel, Borden, a total stranger, initiates the conflict by attempting to expose his rival as a charlatan while Angier moonlights as a medium. In the film, Borden and Angier already know each other while working as apprentice magicians. The Nolans seek to create a stronger motivation for the conflict between the two. They introduce Angier as already being married. Borden is warned by Cutter (the engineer/impresario played by Michael Caine) not to use a certain knot because it's too dangerous when tying Angier's wife's hands during a magic trick. Borden ignores Cutter's advice and as a result of his pig-headedness, Angier's wife drowns when she is unable to untie the knot after being placed underwater in a glass booth. Visually it's a stunning scene but not all that convincing. Borden is depicted as being almost monstrous in the way he crassly ignores all safety procedures; what's more, others take no concrete action during the performance to prevent the mishap from occurring.Borden's pettiness is matched by Angier later on when he seeks to sabotage a series of Borden's stage acts. As the story develops, Angier shows up in a disguise at Borden's performances on more than one occasion. At one point he rigs a pistol causing it to misfire, which seriously injures Borden's hand. Soon afterward, Borden introduces a new stage act, ""The Transported Man"", where he steps into one door and then amazingly steps out of another door on the other side of the stage almost instantaneously. We later learn that Borden's assistant is actually his twin brother and the two have been working together to fool the public into believing that 'The Transported Man' is not an illusion.Angier ends up hiring a look-a-like so he can duplicate Borden's act. For a time it works, but his double is a drunkard who ends up blackmailing him for more money. Angier wants to know the secret to Borden's act, so he enlists his assistant, Olivia, to steal Borden's diary. When he gets his hands on the diary, he realizes he is unable to decode it, so with the help of Cutter, he kidnaps Borden's assistant and holds him for ransom. In exchange for his assistant (who is actually his twin brother), Borden gives him the 'key word' to decode the diary: ""Tesla"".Tesla of course is a real character in history who was Edison's rival in the early development of electricity. Borden had met Tesla earlier and employs electrical sparks from Tesla's 'alternating current' generator in his act. Angier goes to Colorado to meet Tesla and offers to buy his generator which he believes can transport matter. As it turns out (and this undermines the film's entire plot), the machine doesn't transport people but actually clones them. Angier goes back to London and every time he uses Tesla's device, a new Angier appears. After each act, ludicrously, Angier is forced to murder each newly created double (and stores the corpses in tanks underneath the stage).The Prestige has a subplot involving Borden's wife. Sarah, who is unaware of the existence of his twin brother. She learns of Olivia but doesn't understand that its Borden's twin brother who is having the affair with her. Ultimately she commits suicide.The film's scenarists introduce a new twist in the story's climax different than the novel: Borden ends up murdering Angier by placing an open water-filled glass booth under a trapdoor during one of Angier's performances. Borden is arrested and found guilty at trial of the murder. After Borden is executed, Borden #2 shows up and murders Angier #2. We learn that the man executed was actually Borden's twin brother and the Angier who ended up drowning was actually one of Angier's clones. Borden returns to his daughter and in classic Citizen Kane 'Rosebud' style, Angier's nefarious plan is revealed to the audience. As Tesla's machine along with Angier's 'glass tanks' go up in flames beneath the stage, we can see inside one of them: it's one of the 100 Angier clones, still preserved and evidence of the failed career of a monomaniac. 'The Prestige' must get high marks for art design. The costumes and sets make you feel like you're right there in turn of the century Victorian England. Generally the actors acquit themselves well especially Michael Caine as Cutter (a very minor part in the novel). Christian Bale is convincing as Borden but Hugh Jackman's Angier is ordinary. Surprisingly, David Bowie does quite well as the enigmatic Tesla. The women are not developed at all in the novel and unfortunately nothing much is done with them here in the film.The principal characters' obsession in attempting to undermine one another takes on a one-note quality thus exposing the characters as one-dimensional. In addition, once the plot veers off into science fiction/fantasy where people are cloned in a blink of an eye, the best one can say about the film is that it would be more fitting as a third-rate Twilight Zone episode. Nonetheless, 'The Prestige' still manages to hold one's interest as it is 'different' and wins points for mood and atmosphere, providing a glimpse into the rarely looked at world of magic during the Victorian era."
" The ending was stupid
",,The ending was stupid.The rest of the movie was very good.But the ending was very stupid....I was disappointed at the very extreme level of confusion with the writing at the end.The writers were too clever for their own good;as I was trying to extract the meaning of the picture after the credits rolled and I still was not sure exactly what had happened.Too bad.There was no need to befuddled the viewer at wrap time.The crux of the story was very enjoyable to follow.If not for the lame ending I would give this movie a 9 and not a 7.....I was hoping for a finish like Memento.There would have been nothing wrong with closing the story is a plausible and intelligible way.Not to be though I guess...
" Fine Looking Production Wasted on an Incoherent Script
",,"Christopher Nolan's latest puzzle movie is like a big heaping plate of spaghetti: when taken together, it looks like a complete and satisfying meal, but if you pick up any one noodle individually, you find that it's not connected to any of the others and just trails into nothing.I felt like a complete moron walking out of this movie, because I completely missed the big surprise twist at the end. My wife had to explain it to me on the way home. But in thinking back on the movie, I decided that the fault did not lie with me (or so I'd like to believe). Christopher and Jonathan Nolan have written a muddled and confusing screenplay, in which every single plot detail (and there are many) gets equal weight and nothing takes central focus. The ending doesn't feel so much like a creative twist as it does a cheap trick.The performances are fine, though none of the characters ever comes alive. There's so much intricate plot to race through that no one has time to develop any nuance into their roles, and all of the characters serve as ciphers for the plot rather than as psychologically believable and consistent individuals. Christian Bale comes off best; Hugh Jackman is as bland as ever; Michael Caine is just kind of there; and Scarlett Johannsen may as well not even be in the movie for the importance placed upon her.Movies like ""The Prestige"" bug me. They spend all of their time trying so hard to trick and mislead that they never get around to telling a compelling story that I care anything about. Five minutes after you walk out of the theatre, the plot starts unraveling like wet Kleenex, because the film doesn't build its plot from the character level up (which the other magician film from this year, ""The Illusionist,"" did and which is why that's a better movie). ""The Prestige"" is a magic trick that leaves you wanting your money back.Grade: B-"
" A Magic Trick of a Movie
",,"I'll make this short and sweet.What makes this movie so special? Well, its played out like a magic trick, and exactly how the opening monologue describes one.The movie takes us to the time of magicians who were considered the premium entertainers of the day, and also into the dark world of the underbelly of magicians. Bale and Jackman nail their roles, and draw you into the film. Johannson and Bowie add some flavor, and I loved Michael Caine's character Cutter. Nolan plays the role of magician with his directing, twisting and turning your mind, making you want more and then delivering.I had the choice between this and Flags of our Fathers. I went to this with the expectation of an ""average"" movie. I feel now that I saw the better film. It is original, it is deep and I want to see it again.We need more films like ""The Prestige,"" because they draw you into the movie to the point where when you finally reach the films conclusion, you feel as if you had not been shown a story, but where right there when it all happened.10/10 I hope this get some Oscar consideration."
" Austin Movie Show review (brilliant and surprising!)
",,"I see A LOT of movies, and very few big Hollywood studio-produced movies surprise me anymore. I can see the cheap, predictable, and formulaic story lines and twist endings a mile away. ""The Prestige"" is not one of those movies. Like a bad magician attempting to perform the bullet trick, I was blown away! Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are devious feuding magicians, living in turn-of-the-century London (not to be confused with another movie about a magician living in turn-of-the-century Europe, which was, honestly, crap). Jackman and Bale start off as partners, working in the same magic act. But when Bale accidentally kills Jackman's wife in a blotched magic trick, the two spend the rest of their lives trying to destroy one another.Every twist in the plot is more mind-blowing than the one before, and the ending is nothing short of spectacular. ""The Prestige"" may not leave you believing in magic, but it left me believing in movie magic, and I haven't felt that in a long time."
" Thrilling, brilliant, and intelligent
",,"Christopher Nolan is a magician...a magician of cinema: he gives you the setup and then he surprises you with more than one great illusion one right after the other. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) are aspiring magicians and friendly rivals until Rupert's wife (Piper Perabo) dies in a freak accident during a magic act. Both men ensue in a deadly and manipulative competition on who is the great illusionist. Angier want obsesses about figuring out a trick Borden has mastered and sets out to beat him in that competition. ""The Prestige"" is a intelligently written and intense story with a surprising sci-fi kick that will you talking. Excellent performance from the cast especially by the two leads Christian Bale (who is my soul mate and true love) and Hugh Jackman that both deserve Oscar nominations for their performances. Scarlet Johanssen is lovely and sexy as the woman they both love and she is the woman who moves in between them and sees them both for who they really are behind the tricks and illusions. I highly recommend this film and I bow before Christopher Nolan as a director who really knows how to make a thriller. Note: please do not confuse this film with ""The Illusionist"" whereas ""The Illusionist"" is a love story ""The Prestige"" is a true psychological thriller and character study."
" This was a great Movie.
",,"I loved this movie. It was like watching David Copperfield or better Houdini. The entire movie kept me guessing. Don't miss the first 5 minutes or you will be lost through the entire movie. At my theater there was no previews. So there were many people who came in late. I am going to see it again, just so I can really enjoy it. Now that I know how it ends. This will surprise you. THis is not a movie for children under ten, because they will be asking through the entire movie, ""What just happened"". This movie I think will be one of the movies that will be watched 10 or 20 years from now, It is timeless and will be considered a classic. Have fun."
" Most Triumphant
",,"This movie will thrill you till the end. All of the twists and turns keep you on your toes. This is the one and only movie that the second it was over I wanted to see it again! To all those people that like sequels and second chapters in movies, screw that. If there was to be a sequel it would ruin the entire elusiveness of the film. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale gave very powerful performances. Suffice to say it was Bale's best performance on screen period.It isn't for everyone some may get lost in the flashbacks and when the director delves deep into the minds of the characters.Christopher Nolan is one special director I would call him the Steven Spielberg of our time. No joke you will want to see this movie again and again. If you see one movie this year make it The Prestige."
" Amazing Film...A Warning Though!
",,"This film was a typical Chris Nolan, uniquely compelling story and with great actors. Bale really turns in a great performance along with others of course. The twists and turns keep you very intrigued through out the movie. The magic tricks are entertaining and the story is fantastic. You become wrapped up in the rivalry to the point of not caring who really wins in the end, but just really, really wanting to know what happens next because you end up liking both characters.A warning! Do not think about figuring out the movie. If you start wondering to much about the secrets of this movie...you may very well figure it out, and thats not a good thing. You want to be entertained and shocked..right? I thought way to much when watching the movie that I figured out the ending and final secrets. I am still mad at myself, but still equally loved this movie. So don't make my same mistake. Especially if you've seen Nolan's movies before.Great Story. Great Acting. Great Style. Great Ending. Great Film. Very unique, you need to see this movie."
" Great movie....watch close....very sci-fi with reality based detail
",spoiler,"The movie is so confusing, that the ending is unbelievable. The ending is sci-fi, but for me, the inclusion of Tesla in the movie leads you to believe the movie to be true...fact based...suspension of disbelief. Teslas free based electricity, destroyed by Edison, makes this movie even more complex, if you have ever studied Tesla. A machine, or obsession that actually creates body doubles....great twist....do not over think it....it is all illusion! Or is it? It is up to you to see if Teslas toy makes new people, and if Bale's character is really Bale or his double. This is what causes the love tragedy of the suicide of his wife, not knowing or believing if he loves her or not. They take turns. Very complex. And Jackmans character actually being a Lord! That's where the limitless money comes in, and his ability to finance such a battle of two men obsessed with being masters of illusion! Bale had his twin, whereas Jackman relied on money and a double!"
" Everything about this movie was poor
",,"The Prestige was an overblown piece of rubbish. The acting was third-rate. The caricature accents were ridiculous. Christian Bale a cockney - I don't think so.Scarlett Johnanssen, she didn't do anything other than pout. We would ask for more from a big budget movie actress.David Bowie, why didn't you open your mouth when you were talking. You are not a cartoon. You are a real person - or pretending to be.Hugh Jackman, well you were just like High Jackman - likable, but nothing special.After the thrilling Memento, (also directed by Nolan) this was a sorely disappointing film. Seriously, for sadists only!"
" Worst movie about magic, EVER!
",,"This movie was terrible. Based on the talent including the director I expected a lot more than what I got. I was tired and this movie put me to sleep. Batman was pure genius, but I now have to wonder if Nolan is capable of making a solid move that doesn't revolve around deception or confusion like Momento.The acting wasn't impressive and the plot is almost a complete mirror of The Ilusionist. We are staving for a good story, but it appears that people like Nolan, and that cat that did The Departed have to rely on their fan base to hype projects that are not worth the price of admission.I'd say skip this all together, the only magic you will see is $20 disappearing from your pocket."
" A mess
",,"The movie starts out promisingly enough, dumping you in the middle of a story about an often vicious rivalry between two magicians. The setup flatters viewers' intelligence for a while, with some fancy gamesmanship and sleight of hand, literal and figurative, for them follow.Unfortunately, it tosses away everything it had going for it. There's not enough emotional connection with either character to provoke concern about their fate--some momentary shocks, but nothing deeper. The pace slows down, so the plot becomes meandering and the viewer gets plenty of time to predict what scam is being run where. It would have taken a masterful conclusion by the time the movie ended to fully redeem the vapid tedium. There's an attempt to deliver one, but it fails miserably.No complaints with the acting or production values. But simply not interesting."
" Monothematic delusion
",spoiler,"A provocative movie that leaves you with some sociological afterthoughts about illusion, the art of magic and science but as a movie ( I have not read the book on which this adaptation is based ) it is ultimately just too flawed with so many plot holes and an ending/plot twist that is laughable. Its a film about identity and personal obsessions mixed with the archaic art form of theatrical style illusionist's at the turn of the century. Biological, yet diabolical made twins versus sci-fi cloned twins - The mysteries of Gothic age science fiction inspired novels and all it's possibilities ( from Well's The Time Machine to Mary Shelley's Frankenstein ) and even earlier morality tales like Faustus and Prometheus. It has the same 'melting-pot' styling as the The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen - Try stuffing everything but the kitchen sink from Gothic novels and see what you get. What you get is ludicrous. Countless plot holes - Why would a couple of electricity buff cronies build a machine that could duplicate hats, cats and men, just hand it over rather than immediately start gold production/cloning ? Why does the Michael Caine character change sides ? One characters motivation at the denouement is committing suicide nightly as part of a stage show ? Clones having all the cloned persons memories/motivations immediately on being materialised ? And so on and on..."
" A movie that isn't as smart as it tries to be
",,"First of all, I can't speak to the quality of any of the performances, since I don't really tend to notice these things. So just to be clear: my rating isn't a comment on any of the actors.Basically, whether or not I enjoyed this movie came down to my reaction to the multiple twists in this movie...and I saw most of them coming a mile away. So did the two people I saw the movie with. It seems like the movie could have been smarter, and the twists could possibly have been concealed better, but edited together in this way, the movie just seemed like a hack version of a better movie.I found the concept of two feuding magicians interesting, and I came into the movie hopeful, but I was ultimately let down by a movie that was too long and didn't handle a nonlinear storyline very well."
" Solid drama lacks suspense
",spoiler,"Methinks Christopher Nolan is letting his personal style get in the way of a good story. Nolan is a very good director, and a good writer on top of that, yet it seems that he has become overly-reliant on his signature use of chronology to make a movie. There are also far too many scenes in which the actors whisper or speak in hushed voices, a device that leads to lost dialog if you're in a packed theater or in a theater that has an incompetent sound system operator.The Prestige is a wonderfully unusual story about the rivalry and deadly history of two magicians at the turn of the century. Entertainment venues were very limited in that era so the attainment of star status was not only lucrative and coveted, it bestowed a good deal of social acceptance when class divisions were well marked. The tension of this rivalry against this backdrop is good fodder for a film, and teamed with complex personalities all around, romance, secrets, a criminal trial, and the dawn of new technological advances should have made a movie of grand entertainment. But, for me, all the suspense was drained and the drama diluted by Nolan's flashback, flash forward technique. Suspense requires time and pacing, a hum that builds slowly to a crescendo that gives you goose bumps or, at the least, makes you feel the hair on your arms. The potential was there, but Nolan interrupted the ascent too many times to gather momentum. Just as I was feeling the gnawing obsession of Angier, I was bumped to a vignette that re-adjusted my focus. And when I became involved with Borden's life, I got bumped to Thomas Edison. Nolan would not allow me to become completely invested in his characters because he simply didn't give me enough quality time with them despite their continuous presence on-screen. There is also one large plot hole that disrupts a major theme of the story.The Prestige has a nearly perfect cast. At this point in his career, Michael Caine has become so ubiquitous that, to me, he is always Michael Caine, a competent actor who overshadows his characters with his familiarity. He should think about changing his accent and/or his hair color if he continues to hire on so frequently. Bale, Jackman, and Bowie are quite the opposite, playing characters new to their resumes and doing so exquisitely. I've come to expect great performances from Bale and Jackman, but Bowie startled me with his acting chops. Scarlet Johanssen, not a favorite of mine as she has been a bland and flat canvas to date, actually shows some dimension in her supporting role.A nicely done drama in which the sum is far less than many of its superior parts."
" Everything I want to see in a movie
",,"This is ABSOLUTELY SICK. This is the movie that I've never heard about it, but subconsciously needed to see it. Not wanted, but needed. This is the movie that there is no coming back from. Honestly, I have no idea how long will it take me to be this satisfied by a movie. I am trully shocked, how I have never heard of it. Christian Bale and especially Hugh Jackman are one of my favourite actors and who can not love Scarlett Johansson???? This movie is extremely good. Like seriously good. I loved it and I recommend it to everyone. This is trully something you need to watch!!!!"
" a excellent movie

this film is one of five good movies of nolan and maybe the better of them"
" Masterpiece
",spoiler,"A masterpiece. Christopher Nolan's The Prestige is one of my all time favorites.This film is about a rivalry between two magicians (Alfred and Robert). An incident happened earlier on in the film - which caused the two men to fall out. They then try to out do each other, bringing the other's career down in the process. Which is explaining the plot in the most basic form possible.The Prestige has many unpredictable twists and turns that you will never see coming. The film can be a bit hard to follow at the start (as in whether some scenes are flashbacks or not). Luckily you manage to get the hang of it around half way through.The end of this movie is brilliant, it leaves you silent after the credits, just thinking about the film as the credits roll. It is able to stay in your mind days after watching it. It likes to also leave behind some morals also - decent ones that aren't just shoehorned in for the sake of being preachy.The Prestige is a modern masterpiece. It is intelligent and always keeps you hooked. If you enjoy a good drama and have good taste in movies in general, then you'd love it."
" The Best Film
",,"The film opens with the words: ""Are you watching closely?"" In the end, we realize that we aren't watching closely."
" Great!
",,"I've seen this film twice now - about a year ago and then yesterday - and thoroughly enjoyed it both times, even the second time when I remembered some of those fantastic twists in the last half hour. Sometimes it's even more fun to view a film like this when you know a few things, because earlier scenes take on new meaning.It's not an easy film to totally digest, even with two viewings, because that ending has some mind- boggling revelations. Without having to resort to spoilers, let me just say the story is extremely interesting, the acting very good, the period pieces fun to view and it's a pretty clean movie so grandma can also enjoy it, too, without language or sex concerns.Basically, it's a story about obsession between two magicians in the last decade of the 19th century. They continually try to top one another and things get nasty along the way. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fun to watch in those roles, as are Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson in supporting roles.This is one movie guaranteed to have you thinking about it when it's over!"
" A dark magician battle
",,"After two magician apprentices have a deadly accident in one of their tricks and since then, a bitter rivalry is born between them. Having completely different lives and social positions but also many secrets, the two try to make a life out of magic in a desperate pursuit of the ultimate illusion. Sabotage and dirty hands play an important role in their work but with every failed act, their work but also characters greatly improve.It's a very interesting movie which doesn't amaze you with its magic, but, on the contrary, with its plot, characters and especially, it's finale. It's very complex, extremely well thought and executed, its deep atmosphere drawing you slowly into its world.It's a very good movie for magic lovers like myself, but also for people in search of mind boggling plots. A must see for everyone!"
" An incredible story of revenge, obsession and magic.
",,"Everyone has their own favorite films but mine is definitely The Prestige. This is my favorite Christopher Nolan film containing some of my favorite actors in some of their best performances with amazing Cinematography and Production Design and an amazing story filled with suspense and drama from beginning to end. When my sister first showed me the trailer for this film i had no idea it would become my favorite. But here i am praising it to all hell. See it if you haven't already because believe me, It will blow you away."
" In My Top Five Films Of All-Time
",,"Whenever I am given the near-impossible task of ""listing my top five films of all-time"", one thing has held the test of time: since I first watched ""The Prestige"", it has been firmly ensconced on that list.For a basic plot summary, ""The Prestige"" sees two young magicians dueling with each other to see which one can have the most spectacular act. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is a family man yet also devoted to his craft, while Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is more of a natural showman with an obsession for greatness. When a tragedy befalls their friendship and they grow apart, an obsession with perfecting the ""Disappearing Man"" trick drives both of them to lengths most magicians would not be willing to aspire to.This film is an all-time great primarily because of its tremendous plot. I won't say much about it here for fear of spoilers, but suffice it to say that director Christopher Nolan picked the perfect subject--magic--from which to tell this incredible story. It will keep you guessing until the very end...and then even further as you continue to try and piece together the significance of every scene or character interaction. This film isn't as literally complicated as, say, Nolan's earlier effort ""Memento"", but in terms of overall punch and drama it is easily that flick's equal (if not outright superior).The acting is also superb, with Bale & Jackman absolutely brilliant as the leads and Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine, Piper Perabu, & Rebecca Hall solidifying the auxiliary players. The slightest of glance or emotion can speak volumes in a film such as this, which features misdirection as one of its core tenants, and all the actors are wonderful at conveying that.Basically, ""The Prestige"" is a movie that simply needs to be watched by all. It has the perfect ""hook"" in the magic-themed plot, and uses that metaphor as part of the overall storytelling device. Magic is all about obfuscation and sometimes outright deception, which are the main traits that Nolan uses here to craft an intriguing, engaging story and characters. Plus, as sort of an ""added bonus"", the film can be watched even as strictly a period piece (turn of the 19th century) and enjoyed thoroughly on that basis alone. Somehow, some way, you will find yourself completely caught up in the grandeur of ""The Prestige""."
" You are so lucky if you haven't seen this movie
",,"People who haven't seen this movie yet are very lucky that they will get amazed when they watch this. I can easily say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. The scenario is amazing. This is not a movie that you can watch over and over but in your life you must not die before watching it. On the other hand, before watching that movie I had so little information about Nicola Tesla. Before I only know that he is the father of magnetism and 1 Tesla = 10.000 Gauss from Physics :) . But in this movie we can see competition between Tesla and Edison , the working version of Tesla's prototypes. And the hard life of Tesla. I am sure most of the people googled Tesla after watching this movie. And the books about Tesla sold many copies after that movie."
" top hat reproduction?
",,"The first scene shows about 30 hats scattered on a hillside. We learn later that Nikolai Tesla has this amazing gadget, complete with sparks and mini-lighting and then, flash... there's another hat outside? does it also work with cats? maybe humans too? The second scene has Michael Caine explaining and demonstrating how ""magic"" tricks are done. First, there is ""The Pledge"", ie, something is about to happen, in this case a bird-cage with a canary in it, then comes ""The Turn"", where the cage is covered, then smashed, along with the canary, then... ""The Prestige"", and bingo, the canary is alive and well... maybe? And the audience (one 7-year girl) smiles and applauds. The inference is that such amazement with accompany all the other magic tricks that ensue.The third scene is in a court room where one guy is accused of murder. Throughout the movie, there is flashbacks, and flash-forwards and if you can follow it all, then good luck to you. I couldn't, I thought the whole thing a waste of the talents of all these big-name stars.In my rating process, it gets 0/2 for the story, 0/2 for the characters, partly because Bale and Jackman are of similar age and stature, and one or both adopt disguises that simply adds to my confusion. The acting gets a 1/2, since none of them can do much with such a pointless script. Then there is a 1/2 twice for the writing, production and direction. Is there a single really good scene, with memorable dialogue? 0/2 Different planets? It takes all sorts?"
" An exciting masterpiece
",,"The Prestige is one of my favorite films, for many reasons. There's something about the atmosphere in this movie that's just fantastic. It keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the movie at the same time as you get to enjoy the beauty of it all. This film, as most of Nolan's films have a great ""re-watch"" value so listen to the man in the film. - Watch closely. The script is superb, with plot twisters and clever lines and really interesting characters. The way it's been shoot is marvelous, neatly balanced with light and shade. And the acting is in my opinion great too, you actually believe these characters. I think Nolan really did a great job on this film. And I absolutely would recommend it, to everyone!"
" Magically Enlightening
",spoiler,"The movie starts to show you something most people like: magic. Because, not only that's what the movie is about, but the movie itself is, in fact, magic. The conjugation of great actors with a sublime story-line makes ""The Prestige"" a marvelous mystery thriller.From the beginning to the end, the viewer is confronted with a series of events that lead to the ultimate finale - The Prestige.The film has an enormous capacity to hold the viewer's attention thanks to its constant interaction between actors and plot. It creates an addiction and makes you want to figure out the end, but you can't.The end, the real Prestige, it's just magical."
" Best Movie Ever
",,"The Prestige is about two magicians in 19th Century England whose friendship turns into a lifelong rivalry as they go to any and all lengths in order to one-up each other on their quest to create the ultimate illusion, something that would make that David Blaine weirdo run for the hills with his tail between his legs.Who knew people took magic so seriously?So for some reason, this movie came out at the same time as The Illusionist – also about a magician doing his thing in 19th Century England – and I find that people constantly mistake the two. But make no mistake folks, The Prestige is the one to see.It's directed by Christopher Nolan, and, really, what else is there to say. He's one of the best at what he does and it's been crystal for a while now that he's got this whole storytelling thing down to a science. And while the look and feel of this movie is very sleek and stylish in keeping with Nolan's prior and future efforts, the most impressive thing about this movie is the way in which he structures it."
" Are you watching closely!
",,"This has got to be one of the best movies ever made that looks at the lives of illusionists and the great pains they have gone through in times past. The Prestige has an amazing and talented cast, with Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson and Ricky Jay, all putting in terrific performances, playing their roles perfectly. Also, how awesome was David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, what perfect casting on Nolan's part. Speaking of Nolan, I have yet to see him make a bad movie, in fact, his movies just keep on getting better and better. Between the awesome script both he and his brother wrote, and the breath taking cinematography of Wally Pfister, Prestige is utterly perfect. And what an ending, it made want to watch it again right away, just incredible. 5 Beards Out Of 5 Check out my video review @ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZS19QL3VAkk"
" Best way to portray the script
",,"If anyone was given a chance at making this movie, I can assure you no one would come close to what has been done. Christopher Nolan, well known for his Thriller movies with a 'unique' style of film-making has done justice to this script by directing it to the best of his abilities. His 'suspense' mechanism which gradually builds up in the film and leaves viewers baffled towards the end has done wonders yet again. Without spoiling too much, I'd say that the fact that the multiple twists in this plot made the movie even more exciting to watch. Every scene was shot perfectly and the closing scene brings goosebumps to anyone's body.A must watch, if you love Thriller-themed movies with amazing plots."
" No words!! Simply awesome..
",,"I really have no words to describe it. One of the best movies, I have seen till now. The tough to understand plot, so dynamic storyline, too awesome performances by each of the actors and actresses, the rhythmic turn of events,slow and steady pace and what not. Everything has been executed so perfectly. The storyline is so scattered yet so well knit. All the scenes, starting from beginning to end, unfolding series of events, the take overs through diaries, the flashbacks, even the last scene, it's marvellous. I am not being able to define the awesomeness of this movie, through words. In fact, words aren't enough. For people, who mistakenly by chance, go through my review, just one word: ""Watch this movie, before you die. Else you are gonna die a looser""."
" Review: The Prestige
",spoiler,"The movie talks about the rivalry between two magicians, who start out as associates,in late 19th century London. Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) rivalry sparks after Angier accuses Alfred with murder of his wife during one of their performances. Consequently they both had their own separate shows. Angier received more audience to his shows due to the fact that he had a better showmanship, although not the best of tricks. Angier went to one of Borden's shows undercover to find out the nature of his tricks and to possibly learn new ones. But Borden stunned Angier at one of his meager shows with a simple yet meticulous trick . Angier became obsessed and vowed to do whatever he can to outperform or outwit his competitor, which ultimately leads to tragic conclusions.The Prestige is blistering with a star studded cast such as Christian Bale (The Dark Night), Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Michael Cane (The Dark Night), Scarlett Johansson (The Avengers), and famous musician David Bowie. Joining the actors is the proved director Christopher Nolan (Memento). The acting is superb with little or no flaws. Each actor played their role to perfection in depicting the time period they are in. The visuals were top notch. The scenes were shot in a spectacular way and no scene seemed extra or out of place. It really makes you believe its in the 19th century.The plot to some people might be a little too complex or mind bending, but to me I couldn't have enjoyed it any more. The movie was engaging and made you feel like you really want to know whats going to happen next. Although you might seem a little lost at some points of the movie it will all make a sense at the end. And what an ending it was. The twist at the end hits you hard. I never expected it although I was waiting for it, since I've heard about the twist.All in all, the movie was a blast to watch. Its not clichéd at all and It kept you guessing right until the end. It's all thanks to the great delivery by the actors and the atmospheric and moody visuals. It's as good as any magic show can get."
" Obsessive
",,"Film critic Roger Ebert described it as ""quite a movie — atmospheric, obsessive, almost satanic.""-Wikipedia. So true... I honestly can't recall how many times I have watched this movie, its just that good. I never get bored of watching this film no matter which kind of mood it finds me in. This film should serve as an inspiration for future filmmakers who wish to make intelligent movies that can keep the audience entertained as well as thought provoking. This movie is great in so many ways that I felt I had an obligation to express my feelings towards it. The acting is great, the directing is splendid, but what really made this movie awesome was it's script. Hats off to the Nolan brothers for bringing us another masterpiece. P.S This review was long overdue.."
" Christopher Nolan, trick director
",,"I didn't remember who was the director of The Prestige when I finally decided to watch it. So this is not a matter of prejudice, but when the credits eventually rolled I was relieved both because I found it overlong and protracted and because I was now definitely able to put a word on why I don't like Christopher Nolan as a director.Let me start at the beginning. I just start to watch The Prestige as an honest viewer. I am not that found of magic shows but this sounded like a nice story. Actually I remember it's IMDb ranking and the presence of Michael Caine who put the movie on my backlog of recent flicks I might enjoy. Early on the storyline fluctuates between various times: past, past-perfect, present. It's OK, but it really doesn't help the movie build up ""emotional momentum"". The story never trusts continuity so we are demanded to always switch our attention on episodes that explain the whole story one anecdote at a time.PLOT OBSESSION Most viewers seem to like this very authoritative way of telling the story. They are told what to watch, what to understand little by little and it's all about the plot, the plot, the plot. Characters are mere props. In the Prestige I realised Hugh Jackman is only an average actor. I agree the part is not the greatest but he really doesn't shine. As for Christian Bale I already knew he was a big ham who thinks he's good, dead serious while trying too hard to display his actor's studio abilities. Both actors are boring at best in the course of this story, and Christian Bale as the most boring part of all.Well it's a fact that the lead illusionists are mean and inhuman characters. The chopped up narration only makes it more about their sick minds than their wounded souls. Fortunately there are a few nice characters here. Michael Caine adds humanity and presence to a simple part, and the feminine characters also help the movie rises up from its plot obsession. The production values help too, when the nicest characters aren't there.Christopher Nolan is only too happy to have his plot tick like a clockwork, but eventually he is only a trick director in the same way as Agatha Christie was a trick writer. Characters don't matter, they're here to do the trick. Memento was a one-trick movie. Batman begins and The Prestige are very similar with their trick-filled characters immobile while the whole movie revolves around them in a big spinning trick. And Inception is a trick in a trick in a trick. Characters start as tricksters and they soon vanish behind the tricks layer.To me that is the opposite of cinema: the trick is the show while it should be the illusion that it creates. Weird since this is the main lesson, clearly enunciated, in The Prestige: ""There is nothing more disenchanting to man than to be shown the springs and mechanism of any art."" (R. L. Stevenson)"
" ""Are you watching closely?""
",,"Set In the 19th century, this film tells the tale of three friends. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), his wife Julia and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are assistants to a magician. When a water tank trick goes horribly wrong, Robert and Alfred become bitter rivals in the magic industry, trying anything to ruin each others illusions.With one of the best cast line ups in recent years, there's not much chance of losing interest in the stories' characters. I can't single out any one performance because they really do each have their own evocativeness. The film is so consistent with beautiful sets & imagery it really is a feast for the eyes.It's hard to find something wrong with this film. Christopher Nolan is one of the best Directors of today, and this film is more than proof of it. It seems to have been handled with such care. There's chemistry between all the elements and no scene is less than spectacular.Direction: 10/10 (Christopher Nolan knows how to keep an audience from looking away) Cinematography: 10/10 (Visually stunning, such depth in those rich undertones from Wally Pfister) Editing: 10/10 (Lee Smith's sequences are well executed and fitting for drama) Acting: 9/10 (Some minor things may bother you, but not enough to keep you from enjoying) Dialogue: 10/10 (Some very well thought concepts are conveyed through the dialogue alone) Sound: 10/10 (The huge sound team put together a phenomenal recording of pristine quality) Effects: 9/10 (Well coordinated effects which are seamlessly integrated into the film) Art Direction: 10/10 (Realistic sets and props really nurture the film's aesthetic) Costumes: 10/10 (Very fitting, excuse the pun, for the period) Music and/or Score: 10/10 (Lovely orchestrations which give life to moments with no dialogue)Total Score: 98/100The Prestige is an enchanting film with some subtle charms. David Bowie's small role as Nicola Tesla is also something to make note of. If you can allow yourself to be drawn into the world of magic then this is a film you will live."
" Entertaining - but slightly overheated - mishmash of Victorian period melodrama and science fiction.
",,"Two Victorian London magicians (Christian Bale and Hugh Jackson) become involved in professional rivalry which has dramatic and far-reaching consequences for both of them.Magic is by its nature being able to appear to bend the rules of nature and/or physics - while, in reality, being no more able to do so than you or I.Equally the role of an intelligent viewer is to try and guess and predict the unexplained, the how, or the hidden twist (if you believe there might be one). A film which is allowed to take both feet of the floor (more literally than metaphorically!) destroys all such audience games.You can't knock Michael Caine for his supporting roles, because he plays them so well. Jackson and Bale are both overheated and a bit hysterical, and besides which, professional rivals tend not to hate each other deep down. There is - again deep down - a respect and admiration for the skill of the other.Here, for the purpose of the plot and a does of extra drama, this relationship has to turn murderous. This film could have survived, and be even been better, with a bit less plot and a bit more breathing in the dusty backstage atmosphere of the music hall.(And very well created it is - the art direction is simply superb.)Feel for female lead Scarlett Johansson, not a lot to do and almost window dressing in this production. I will watch her career with interest, (which red-blooded male wouldn't?) when she has more to do than looking good in an assistant's costume.While entertained and involved I have to say this is a lesson more in what the audience is prepared to accept than it is a cleverly crafted film script. Many films contain nonsense and illogical developments, but this doesn't lay its cards out on the table early enough. You can't switch formats mid-film.In many ways, it is a form of cheating. Or more accurately a case of ""wouldn't it be good if only....."""

" Obsession is a young man's game
",,"Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, and Scarlett Johansson star in ""The Prestige"" a 2006 film directed by Christopher Nolan.Jackman and Bale play Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, magicians in turn of the century London. The story is told in flashback until close to the end of the film. Angier and Borden start out as friends and colleagues, working as a magician's assistant. Tragedy strikes, and they become mortal enemies. Each becomes famous as a magician, and when Borden performs the ultimate illusion, Angier becomes obsessed with trying to find out how he did it and becomes determined to top it.This is an excellent film that will have you with your jaw on the ground at the end. In my own case I had to go back and re-watch the ending. This isn't a movie you can watch and zone out - the plot requires active following, as Nolan switches points of view between Angier and Borden, and skips from the past to the present. However, he does it with a master's skill. The other interesting thing about the film is the bad guy/good guy concept, which he turns upside down and inside out.""The Prestige"" captures the atmosphere of 19th century London perfectly. All of the actors - and the casting is superb - are in top form, with Caine giving an steady performance as the old magician who tries to keep Angier grounded and David Bowie as the mysterious Nikola Tesla. Jackman and Bale are well-matched as adversaries - both volatile and ambitious, driven men.Like a magician, Nolan distracts the viewer with one thing and then pulls a rabbit out of the hat. Sheer brilliance.You'll want to see this movie again. Highly recommended."
" 2 dueling magicians
",,"well this one was a first a movie about 2 dueling magicians, fighting it out to the death, Michael Caine gives a great performance in here also, the two magicians Borden, and Angiers are dynamic in their tricks, deceit, lies , and overall performance,, the two females characters are also pretty good eye candy. Always been fascinated by magicians,, especially the greatest one of all ,, the late great Harry Houdini, this is a hard movie to keep track of , with all of the twists and turns, it is very good, just kinda hard to follow, with all of the trickery and other things going on in the movie,, this is the kind of movie where yoiu have to watch it a couple of times to get the hang of it,, but otherwise it is an entertaining flick."
" Make It Disappear
",spoiler,"This well-mounted production is a study in waste. Waste of a great cast. Scarlett Johanssen is given nothing to do but look pretty and be mean. Her character is not developed enough for us to know why she is as treacherous as she is. Michael Caine is excellent and steals every scene he's in. But he is not in enough scenes to save the movie. Piper Perabo is not given enough screen time to establish her character before she is killed off.Hugh Jackman is wooden and mildly comical as one of the two obsessed competing magicians (looking very much like comic Joe Flahrety). Christian Bale does his usual imitation of a stick. These two seem to have taught David Bowie how to play a stick as well.The story should be engaging, but is not. It bores one with its trite little clumsy plot twists. Actual, the director could have saved some time and footage by just flashing ""PLOT TWIST"" on the screen each time.The surprise ending (could have just flashed ""SURPRISE ENDING"" on the screen) is no surprise. But it is a relief. At long last this turkey ends! Oh, yeah, and only we the audience know the real secret! How remarkable.I've given Prestige four stars; for its high production values and for Michael Caine."
" A wonderful magician... but a dreadful showman
",,"According to Micheal Caine's grizzled Cockney showman Cutter, every great magic trick consists of three parts.The first is the pledge - our magician shows us something ordinary. In the opening minutes of The Prestige Nolan fans will certainly feel on safe territory. The nonlinear narrative jerks us, under the familiar tones of Micheal Caine (currently Nolan's go-to man for Wise Old Associates), into the world of late-Victorian showmen - a world of canary cages and dusty warehouses, red curtains and blinding spotlights.Nolan's familiar themes of all-encompassing obsession (tackled brilliantly in his Batman films and the earlier Memento) are instantly addressed in the characters of Alfred Borden and Robert Angier, two magicians locked into a battle of wits over the accidental death of Angier's wife - of which he holds Borden responsible. Like a latter-day Hitchcock, Nolan has carved out a style of thriller all of his own - the washed-out orange filters, the noir-y smoky streets, Christian Bale, Micheal Caine. Strip back the super-hero elements and you've almost got a Victorian Batman Begins - except with two Batman's who prefer to use their brains over their fists.The second part of any great trick is the turn - in which our magician takes the ordinary something, and makes it do something extraordinary. It's from this comfortable position that The Prestige's increasingly convoluted and at times outright nasty plot can unfold - as the rivalry increases, consuming their entire lives, Angier finds himself drawn deeper into something close to true magic - and like all true magic, your disbelief - the 'look on their faces,' the source of Angier's obsession - becomes paramount, as Nolan is giving full reign to introduce the truly fantastical.Like Hitchcock the plot is everything - all the characters and backdrops are for the most part - like Scarlet Johanson's assistant - set dressing. In The Prestige everything hinges upon the twist. Nolan is perhaps the finest thriller director working in Hollywood today, yet the true human focus of his films is often subservient to the narrative - and The Prestige is no different.Borden's relationship with his wife seems unnecessarily forced (despite Bale's decent performance) and a little devoid of chemistry, as is Angier's with his assistant (Johanson) - yet this matters little, as the human element is there only to make the shocks more potent. As Cutter says, a lovely assistant is often one of the best forms of misdirection, and as The Prestige's narrative unfolds this soon becomes apparent in the film itself. The exception is David Bowie's surprisingly poignant turn as long-suffering failed genius Nikola Tesla, and the ever-reliable Micheal Caine.Finally at the end of any good trick, a magician brings back the object, the final deception - The Prestige. And as seems to be the case with all thrillers post-Usual Suspects, the twists in The Prestige's final reveal will completely change your viewing experience a second-time around.So... is the trick a success? Perhaps Angier's words sum up Christopher Nolan best - 'A wonderful magician, but a dreadful showman.' The narrative itself, the film's core, is perfect - in fact its twists and turns, its self-referencing, its playfulness elevate it above almost any other thriller released since.Yet where Nolan falls down is the presentation. Cinematography ranges from competent to good, but you don't get any Kubrick-style flashes of genius. Other than the two characters driving the plot, there's not a lot of human emotion to the proceedings - you never find yourself particularly caring for many of the side-characters, even when terrible things befall them (and without meaning to give too much away, terrible things DO befall a few of them). I've already compared Nolan to Hitchcock - a little hyperbolic, maybe, but he's the closest thing we have these days to the master - and he shares his faults, too.And yet for all that, The Prestige is a trick not to be missed, a rare enigmatic gem of a film that fails to give up all its secrets even at the end. A must-see for thriller fans, and an awe-inspiring treat for everyone else - and unlike the tricks it portrays, definitely worth seeing twice."
" Far from prestigious
",,"I'm afraid this film is by someone who made one great film and now everything he does is regarded as a masterpiece. At some point people are going to realize that everything he touches is not gold and I'm surprised it didn't start with this film, as it's really quite bad. The story just does not flow well, it is told in a very serious dark tone which just makes it seem too ridiculous and not at all believable. A lot of the dialogue is quite bad and clichéd especially involving Chistian Bale who just isn't up to the part. The story is an interesting one but the way it's told is not. Only in the last half an hour does it really get going but in the end it leaves you unsatisfied and irritated at the liberties it's taken with you. It says something when the best thing about the film is David Bowie's performance, yes he's actually very good. (4/10)"
" Muddled Magic
",,"A couple of magicians develop a heated rivalry around the start of the 20th century in London. Nolan has a nice visual flair but can't elicit good performances from his big-name cast. The acting of Jackman and Bale, the latter sporting a bad English accent, may be kindly described as average. Caine fares better, although he seems to be still playing Batman's butler. Johansson is wasted in a negligible role. The script is so contrived, muddled, disjointed, and utterly ridiculous, and the characters are so poorly developed, that one doesn't care who wins the rivalry. It's a dull and long-winded story with an unsatisfying conclusion."
" Pay Close Attention
",,"In the end of the Nineteenth Century, in London, Robert Angier, his beloved wife Julia McCullough and Alfred Borden are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become enemies. Both become famous and rival magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.After seeing ""The Illusionist,"" which I thought was amazing a magic movie can get, I held my expectations really high for ""The Prestige."" I'm comparing these two films because they were released close to each other, with a similar genre as magic films. Which is the better movie, you ask? ""The Illusionist"" blows ""The Prestige"" away.I'm starting to wonder why this film has such a high rating. Probably a lot of fans of Christopher Nolan, who is known for making great films, such as ""batman Begins"" and ""Memento."" I would say this movie is just mediocre, and not at the level of his usual films.I will say this film has style. The cinematography was great. What I was disappointed by this film is the on going predictable-ness. I might be in the majority when I said this. I saw the twist coming. What came from the very first scene in the film was a great ""pay attention to the movie!"" moment but it went downhill from there.Throughout the film, you'll find yourself laughing at least two times from two very laughable and improbable scenes. Other than that, the film tries to be clever and trying to create something new at the same time. But all fails. It's mediocre at best from the storytelling. The performances were decent, in the end.Overall, I found it a hard film to love and to watch over and over again (they say watching this film over and over again will make it better). The visual effects were good, the plot may give you some disbelief, and the film is just one step back for Nolan. It's a worthy rent, at least."
" Now That's Magic!
",spoiler,"My summary title refers not to the overall quality of the film itself, but to the horrendous confidence trick used by the author to resolve the plot. Yes, I know it's an ending well prepared for, in fact the so-called twist is laid on with a trowel throughout the movie; but the moral the writer had in mind appears to be ""Don't mass murder your electrically created duplicates or karma will visit you"".Well, thank's, mate. I'll be careful not to in future...I caught this on DVD the other night and having read a few of the positive and negative comments about the movie find myself falling between the two opposing view points. I certainly agree the ending doesn't work but there's also a lot to commend the film.Firstly, it holds the interest, with an involving narrative and likable performances from the principals. The rivalry between Jackman and Bale is both dark and witty, with a tendency towards much beard- wearing. Michael Caine is his usual bright self, although his performance is exactly the same as he gives in 50 other Michael Caine movies. David Bowie gives a neat 3 scene cameo as Nikola Tesla, who in real life looked like a member of Metallica and stood about 6ft 7 inches tall. Despite this lack of verisimilitude I liked the character's inclusion very much.The atmosphere of the Victorian stage show is well presented, and the twists with the diaries is well done. The fact that you spot Bale has a twin almost instantly doesn't spoil things too much. Nice to have a twin that would chisel his own fingers off so you could perfect a stage ""trick"", though.Christopher Nolan seems to be going down the Shyamalan route by having a twist ending in every film he does. It worked in Batman Begins and Memento. Here it's as flat as a mortar board sat on by Oliver Hardy. Leave off the twists for a while, Chris.I think one commentator's remark that the lack of preparation in causing the suspension of disbelief for the audience is right on the money. In an otherwise realistic milieu, we are hit with a device completely out of Alice in Wonderland, for no very good reason.A goodish but flawed movie; nobody ever seems to have solved the script problems."
" If you've seen one magician movie, you've seen 'em all
",,"This was a fine movie in some ways. The actors were excellent, especially Michael Caine. The action kept moving. The twists (and you know there are going to be twists in a movie about magicians) keep on coming.However, the movie has a lot of flaws: The editing among all the different chronological sequences is confusing. I think the director intended us to be unsure of (for instance) who is reading whose diary when. It's not that hard to sort out where we are given a minute or so following every jump in time and space, but after a while it's annoying to think the director requires such tactics to keep us off balance.The part played by Nicola Tesla is ridiculous. My jaw dropped toward the end of the movie after they asked us to accept such a preposterous piece of pseudo-history.Scarlet Johanssen's accent is consistent, but how come it's the accent of an upper-class Englishwoman, when she's hanging out with these low-class magicians? At least it's better than David Bowie's accent. He is supposed to be Croatian but sounds like a stoned Scotsman.The skimpy costumes worn by the magicians' assistants seemed too skimpy for Victorian times.I guess I just don't like magician movies. They're always about revealing how tricks are really done, and, as someone says early on in the film, If you reveal the secret of the trick, you instantly lose the audience's respect. To compensate for that, they have to rise to a crescendo of revelations, and it's never enough compensation for me."
" How many times a movie can trick you?
",,"I was told that the movie is above the average but I did not expect it to fix me to the chair for two hours actually.I know it's been mentioned in many other comments already but I also want to praise the director as how easily he tells us the story with perfect flashbacks. If you watch closely (pun intended) then you never get lost in this very complex script.As speaking of acting and cast, it's almost perfect. Bale gives unbelievable play and Jackman is man of his role also it's pure joy to watch Michael Caine. Johansson is very believable and quite pretty (oddly not so beautiful in this one though.)I'm afraid the movie could not hide ""the secret(s)"" till the end for me, yet it surprised and amazed me so many times. I can see now how true it is that one gets fooled mostly because he wants it this way.It's for sure that I'll see more tricks when I watch it again and again. This movie is one of those movies that is gives you too much at once and you need to watch it till you absorb all of what it offers."
" How the mighty fall
",,"Sure, it's clever, but not clever enough. ""The Prestige"" falls behind high expectations raised by the filmmakers' track record, by stunning trailers and a magnificent poster that would grace any museum wall. Unfortunately, the key plot device is predictable from half-way through at the latest. But then, Wally Pfister's masterful cinematography is compelling all by itself. Also, perhaps one shouldn't complain when a movie gives you David Bowie as Nicola Tesla. The script sure strikes the chord of truth when it calls him ""not a magician, but a real wizard"". In my book, that's as accurate a description of Tesla as it is of Bowie. From what I've seen of the Nolan brothers' work, I wish they stuck to their own screenplays like they did in ""Memento"". Having said that, I still can't wait for ""The Dark Knight"". If anyone can teach that old bat some new tricks, it's Christopher Nolan."
" wolverine + batman = one damn movie
",,"sacrifices must be made to achieve the highest level of success. The main reason for me to see this movie was Hugh Jackman. The combination between wolverine and batman stars produces intense competition to in order to produce the greatest magic known to man. not recommended for young children. the climax is confusing and it was only through a friend that i understood it. This movie proves that magic is no less than a competitive sport to gain favor from the audience. A thriller/suspense movie with good performances especially Christian bale.Its pretty fun to know what a magician's life would be , may even inspire us to learn a few tricks."
" Are you watching closely?
",,"Olivia Wenscombe: It won't bring your wife back. Robert Angier: I don't care about my wife. I care about his secret.Christian Bale (The Machinist, Batman begins) was absolutely stunning in the tale of two magicians who are constantly trying to outdo each other. X-man Hugh Jacman was his rival, who ostensibly wanted revenge for the death of his wife, but who was really more interested in being number one.The is the basic story, but it is what is going on beneath that that makes this a superior film. While you are watching the rivalry, the magicians are preparing a trick that will amaze and astonish you. You know it has to be a trick, but they pull it off anyway, and that is what makes this film.The outstanding camera work was by Wally Pfister, who did Batman Begins, and who will be doing The Dark Knight. The superb direction was by Christopher Nolan, who also did the two mentioned films.Both stars were admirably supported by Michael Caine, British star Rebecca Hall, and the ever-lovely Scarlett Johansson."
" A little-bit of sci-fi to help finish a too long movie
",spoiler,"I watch this movie yesterday and was disappointed. Not by the acting nor the way the movie is constructed (flashback), but by the ridiculous ending. The ""twin"" trick was quite interesting but not that surprising. But the ""cloning-machine"" trick was hilarious in a, until then, realistic movie. If, from the beginning, we would have known that we were in a fantastic type movie then it is acceptable. But the movie was presented as a true and realistic rivalry between two ambitious magicians. After the clone trick, I was expecting martians to come and save Borden's brother from being hang. It looks like the scenarist did not know how to finish its, already, very long scenario and had to find something incredible to fool the audience. ""... Whaa, he makes clones of himself with electricity in 1899..."". Tesla and Edison must roll themselves in their graves laughing."
" A film with an IQ
",,"Of course the cast and director pedigree give an indication you're going to get a good film, but The Prestige exceeds expectation.The backbone of the plot is simple; two magicians obsessed with producing the ultimate illusion and more importantly outdoing their rival.The storyline has been superbly presented by Nolan. This is a film that keeps you guessing but, in a similar manner to the sixth sense, there's honesty in the production that means every pertinent piece of information required to work out what's going on is clearly presented on the screen right from the start.Arguably the best of the year."
" Irresponisble to Post Spoiler comments in the HEADLINE that appears - !

STOP POSTING SPOILERS - IT'S NOT COOL, SMART OR FUNNY... RT-Prague"
" Absolutely Fantastical.
",,"This is a movie. A movie of such epic proportions I hardly know what to write. Except that it is absolutely incredible. But with the acting talents of Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Van Helsing), Christian Bale (Batman Begins), Michael Caine (Children of Men) combined with the director of Batman Begins Christopher Nolan what else can you expect. The actors are all perfect for their roles. Scarlett Johansen tends to annoy me but she was actually pretty good in this movie.This movie takes an in depth look at human nature: Its struggle for revenge, its need to be at the top, and its obsession and duplicity. The pledge, turn, and prestige of this film are all deftly executed and the special effects and symbolism are incredible. All in all, a must see. I will be greatly surprised if it doesn't take home some little gold statues."
" A deceptive, spellbinding piece of supreme film-making
",,"""Are you watching closely?"". This question is repeated several times in Christopher Nolan's fifth feature, a complex, compelling opus that sees him return to Mementoish territory.Set in Victorian London, The Prestige deals with magic, although not the kind we're used to: what we see is a much darker side of this fascinating profession, which might even be lethal to some people. In fact, death is present from the beginning: right after Michael Caine's opening monologue about the three acts every magic trick is divided in (the third act gives the film its title) we witness a tragedy, as the famous Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), aka The Great Danton, drowns during his last performance. His colleague and former friend Alfred ""The Professor"" Borden (Christian Bale) is accused of murdering the showman, and as he's sent to jail the events that led to that fatal night are told in a series of interconnected flashbacks: the two used to work together, under the guidance of the experienced Cutter (Caine), and were quite good friends, until a terrible tragedy put an end to that comradeship. As the years pass, the rivalry between them gets more and more dangerous, the two using their different qualities (Borden has better tricks, Angier more charisma) to become the best magician in Europe, in a conflict so devastating it might destroy everything they have.It's not just the audacious storytelling that makes The Prestige similar to Memento. The two films also share the key theme: obsession. Leonard Shelby, the disturbed protagonist of Memento, insisted on tracking down the man who killed his wife, even though he knew he probably wouldn't succeed because of his inability to form new memories. The same thing happens to Angier and Borden: they're so obsessed with winning the duel they don't even care about the people surrounding them or what actually made them enemies in the first place. Around these layered, mysterious and intriguing characters Nolan constructs a riveting picture with stunning attention to detail: like his protagonists, the director fools the audience while laying out the clues that will lead to the shocking final revelation, a mind-blowing climax which adds poignancy to Cutter's instantly memorable line ""You want to be fooled..."".In his intent, Nolan is impeccably helped by his cast, each of the actors, including Scarlett Johansson as both magicians'assistant/mistress and David Bowie as the eccentric scientist Nikola Tesla, adding shades of darkness and ambiguity. Bale and Caine, working with the director for the second consecutive time, are superb, playing interesting variations of their Batman Begins roles (tormented, lonely leading man and wise, caring mentor/father figure respectively) and raising expectations for said movie's sequel, and Jackman is easily their match, successfully developing the emotional maturity he began to show in X2 and delivering his finest performance to date. The real star, however, remains Nolan, who consistently pulls the right strings in the right moment, thus ensuring The Prestige is one of the absolutely best films of 2006, not to mention (possibly) his best achievement so far."
" The Prestige is a smart twist on the vengeance angle
",,"The Prestige uses visual excitement,through magic tricks, to keep you interested,but the story line is also magical. After seeing The Prestige 3 times, I realized how much of the plot was visually laid out in front of my eyes, and I still missed it. Gosh, it was great to see a movie that can be watched over and over, and grow better each time you see it. The book, which was re-released and is the same copy written in 1975. It is nothing like the movie(though the book story is good), but the screen play writers need to be commended on their ability to take a small concept from the book and change it into the wonderful story they created. I can't wait to buy The Prestige movie, when it comes out next month."
" A very good movie!!
",,"I saw the trailer and just thought you gotta see that movie!! Especially because I also love to see and perform magic. The story of the movie is very exciting, but at first I was confused as in the movie there were several times used and that was kind of confusing. But as the story was very good and there were often sudden changes and surprises. I would advise everybody to watch the movie who wants to see an exciting thriller and also dramatic story about success and how the people change if they got success. One thing which is kind of confusing that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackmann are enemies but have a really similar outer appearance therefore sometimes you ask yourself who is that because you can't say who it is from the behind. As already said all in all it's a very good movie."
" Simply magic!!!
",,"Could it have been better? No. Not in my opinion. This film will take you on a magical journey through the behind-the-scenes of magic. Throughout that journey it is secretly building up to something that will make you shiver, make your jaw drop, but most of all make you absolutely love this movie. There's no stage where you find yourself wondering can I continue to sit through this, even at 130 minutes. Every scene, every line, every last word is acted out perfectly. I'm not sure whether it was the brilliant acting or simply the gripping, intriguing storyline itself which made this film so enjoyable throughout and not just when the twist is eventually revealed. Possibly it was both.But needless to say from my point of view this is an obvious must-see. Some people complain that movies with twist endings are often boring for 95% of the movie, and possibly they're right. But that's what makes it so good that these types of movies are taking a step in the right direction and will hopefully only get better as time goes on. If indeed they do then there are going to be some future movies to look forward to - because this one is a cracker!"
" Its a movies where you have to wonder if you're looking carefully enough and following the plot.
",,"This is an outstanding performance of the actors combined with tremendous plotting technique. It surprises the audience and generates an atmosphere of mystery and magic. The whole time from the very beginning of the play you concentrate on looking close enough to find the scam hidden behind the actors actions. No matter how much you focus you will still be surprised. I love the idea of the *special trick that Borden has thought of and the other man is trying to steal it from him. All the time he makes life harder for himself and tries to find out the real* way to do it. In the end he finds out that it was a very easy trick because Borden used a double..his own twin...and he says : ""Life is easy, why do you make it so much complicated?"" This is the whole point of the movie!..We try to look sooo close that we search for something ultimately complicated, whilst it's straight forward and easy. We look for so much more than there is in reality. It is like a metaphor of life and the human society. It shows the natural norms of the human behaviour."
" Dark, mysterious and a very human story...
",,"It was a very ""dark"" film which showed me how far a man can go for success by any mean.. it was Christopher Nolan's best film ever.. the performances where very very good,very touching.. Christian bale was the best and it suites him this kind of roles.. leaving the cinema Theadora i felt a pain on my chest and from that i understood that the film was in me..this is the way i can sense if a film is the best like v for vendetta or million $ baby or mystic river and lord of the rings..Hugh Jackman has talent but except this role he chooses wrong films some times.. in this films he was the best to stand against C.Bale.. this film can be nominated at the Oscars for 1st actor Christiane Bale 2nd actor David Bowie best director Christopher Nolan best score David Julan 2nd actress Borden's wife(Sarah) and hardly best picture.. but if this not happen that's alright.. i;m gonna still love this film.."
" Human condition
",,"This is truly an movie of the human condition. I will not waste time here confirming what is truth: the movie was brilliant. There are many reasons why: screenplay, actors, cinematography, theme. In a word: clever use of story-telling with top notch actors. Many of the other movie-goers didn't take their eyes off the screen the entire time the movie played and even after it was over. It cannot be compared to the other gem, The Illusionist, however. Christian Bale is a force to be reckoned with (has this guy ever been horrible in a movie yet?!) and Wolverine sheds his paws and grows the heart of robbed man. Love, Loss, Obsession, Power, and Surprise! A terrific movie that I will buy and have at my side once available. Watch the movie...better yet, let the movie show you a trick..."
" Amazing, complex story of trickery and deception...
",,"1st watched 1/1/2007 - 9 out of 10(Dir-Christopher Nolan): Amazing, complex story of trickery and deception put together by a Director who appears to be becoming a master in this field, which he started in his first movie, Memento. Christopher Nolan starts off with a simple story of a man accused of the murder of another man. They both happen to be in the same field of magic and we're major competitors in this arena. We then are taken backwards to the events that led up to this supposed murder. This is where the movie becomes extremely complex and is driven by the wonderful subtle performances of everyone involved. This is one of those movies where you don't want to miss any points of dialogue because you're afraid you'll miss out on something important, and with Nolan, you will be. He is able to sustain a mostly dialogue-driven movie for over two hours and your mind is still racing as the final credits roll. The magicians', played by Hugh Jackman & Christian Bale, personal battles are the major focus which started when Jackman's character's wife is killed during a failed magic trick where he blames Bale's character. But also entering unto the scene is the idea of performing the ultimate illusion by possible using ""real magic"", which in this case is electricity re-directed to transpose a person from one place to another. This is being tested by a man named Tesla, played wonderfully by the rock star/actor David Bowie, as the government & Thomas Edison vehemently tries to pull the plug & funding to shutdown the experiments. This subplot was a personal revelation to me because of a song by a group coincidentally called Tesla, called ""Edison's medicine"", which suggests trickery & under-handed things being done so he could gain the rights to electricity. Anyway, back to the movie--- All of these elements are blended together so well that the only reason I didn't give the movie a 10 is because of the confusion at the end(wish was actually part of the fun of the movie, but could be distracting to some). It would amaze me if a better movie was made in 2006, but it probably won't win the Oscar because it's too thought-provoking, which is too bad. I will be anxiously awaiting another Christopher Nolan movie though, as I'm sure many other people are as well."
" A Truly Intelligent and Gripping Piece of Art
",,"Over these last few years, I have been increasingly against the critics opinions on the quality of movies, whether it is on their criticism of blockbusters and lack of originality, or studio's greed for money on detriment of quality. These past year, i have to start to agree with them. That was until the Prestige came on. It has been a really long time since I have seen a movie that truly made me care about the characters and their motivations, and most importantly it has been a really long time since I have seen a movie that made me totally forget about the hectic life outside, and make me devout myself entirely without looking at my watch at least once. Obviously that isn't a coincidence, this only happens when true cinematic geniuses are behind the camera, either Christopher Nolan's passionate and intelligent direction and skillful writing adaptation capabilities, or Pfister's lighting and Julyan's score. That combined with a top-notch cast leading this peace of cinematic brilliance presented as a magic trick itself makes it a as enjoyable as possible. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman battle themselves character and acting-wise, because you never know which one has the advantage over the other, and to make the recipe perfect Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall and David Bowie support the duo not over shadowing them but composing a colorful and deep canvas. I guess what I like the most about the Prestige is the fact that the movie is about magicians composing magic tricks and the three steps to complete them; and the movie is actually presented to us audience in that way: You have The Pledge (Who the characters are, their motives and backgrounds), The Turn (you realize nothing is what it seems, twists keep on coming and you never know who has leverage) and The Prestige (the most interesting of them all, because you are given an explanation for the events, which explains all of its ""cientific impossibilities"") But are they really impossible. Were all the explanations given to you the reality?.....Did you watch it closely? Make sure you did. Because the explanation is not what it seems. That is the real Prestige of ""The Prestige""."
" whats important is the final act
",spoiler,"The prestige is the most perfect film i have seen for some time now.The prestige is all about its final act.You are left gasping for the last 15 minutes, as the director like a magician unfolds all the surprises in the final act,which is what the magician call the prestige.The story of the film unfolds just like a magic tricks and illusions of the magician. It starts with a simple magic act going wrong due to certain circumstances in which like every trick, there is a disguise, someone who moves our concentration from the real thing.In this case,The rival magician is present at the place of the unfortunate act, due to which he is accused of being the spoil sport and hence the murderer.This first act takes the viewers to the next act,which apparently in this film is set in the flashback of these rival magicians life.This act is full of contriving twists that feels like magic tricks(confusing).Here you really hope that the writer better have some good reasons for the unfolding events and good reasons he has which is the final act and that is The prestige.Just when you feel that justice is not done,the dark twist actually makes you feel good at the end and you are given an unintentional message that magic tricks are eventually small illusion which should not be delved in deeper studies with science as the fulcrum. They are all illusions and should remain as the acts and art(not science) of illusion. All in all a great film and a perfect magic act.Good to see that it has already entered in the list of top 250 films of all time."
" Don't you just love it when a movie surprises you like this...
",spoiler,"I honestly went along to this movie with no real expectations on a Monday night as a way of killing time on a rainy nite. I came out two odd hours later convinced I'd saw the best movie of 2006. I hadn't really heard much word of mouth praise from any friends, and it seemed to have slipped by unnoticed due to the massive PR around Bond (also very good - possibly the best ever) and Borat to a lesser extent, but when the cinema screen filled to capacity on a Monday night after having been out for 6 odd weeks I began to feel like I was in for a treat. It's a funny movie in that they scatter clues all around as it zooms from flashback to present day, and if your paying attention you can start to figure out what's happening, but because there are so many false clues and hints I genuinely had to think for a good hour after the movie as to what happened. Bale and Jackman are phenomenal as lead actors, and draw you into believing who is in the right and who is in the wrong due to their previous character stereotyping. All in all, I can't recommend this movie highly enough, and please don't wait for a rainy night like I did..."
" Better Than Most Current Movies in Theaters, but Ultimately Disappointing (no spoilers)
",,"The Prestige has a lot of good things going for it. Great acting, a top-notch cast, interesting characters, beautiful scenery and gorgeous costumes. The film takes place in the late-Victorian period just as science is about to advance by leaps and bounds. Understanding, harnessing and manipulating electricity is the new and exciting craze. Add in two rivaling magicians who want to top each other's best act and the stage is set for what I hoped would be a gripping story. Piper Perabo was the most likable character and wish she had more screen time. There's also a sci/fi twist that is quite interesting too. All kinds of good things to make a great film.But...There are several ways that The Prestige didn't work for me. It has huge plot holes and continuity problems. Upon further analysis after the film, the logic was just plain sloppy. These issues should have been addressed and rewritten prior to filming. It really ruined the magic of the film.The pacing is uneven. Most of the time it's very slow (slower than Masterpiece Theater). If I had been watching the film on TV, I wouldn't have made it all the way through, but I was in the theater so it kept my attention span.The ending though interesting, was very disappointing. The film turned into a second-rate, M. Shymalan script for the last half hour. People in the theater were laughing after the end monologue because it sounded heavy-handed and ridiculous.Even though the actors did a good job, the range of each character was quite small. There was no depth. Jackman was obsessive, Caine was the all-knowing sage, Bowie was the mysterious scientist, Johansson was the slut, and all the rest. You get the idea. The lack of growth in the character development made the story boring and stale. I just didn't find myself caring for what happened to any of them by the end.The Prestige is actually a rather dark film. Much sadder and than I expected. It is not a feel good film. I would have been fine with the darkness if the plot didn't have so many holes in it. I usually enjoy a good mystery or thriller, but found the twists to be rather predictable.A quick warning for animal lovers: there's some animal cruelty. It's not as horrible as The Brothers Grimm, but it's something to be aware of if you are going to take a child to see the film or are sensitive about those things.If you aren't into analyzing films and don't care about it making sense, you'll probably enjoy the film. I was fine with the sci/fi aspect of The Prestige, it's the plot that has the problems. Some of the twists work and some are just silly and sloppy writing.I sincerely wanted to enjoy this film, but it wasn't as dazzling as I had hoped it would be. I wanted it to be a 10, but the most I can give it is 7."
" Get Carter
",spoiler,"Those who read and enjoyed the novel Carter The Great will be predisposed to enjoy the prestige. I hesitate to employ the phrase 'rip-off' but no one writes in a vacuum and the similarities between the novel and the film are akin to those that would obtain at a convention of Siamese Twins. Both are 'period' works, Carter is set roughly eighty years ago, Prestige roughly one hundred; both revolve around rival magicians - or 'illusionists' - a rivalry so intense that even murder is countenanced; in both novel and film a magician loses a wife (in the film, as if anxious to avoid rip-off claims, each magician loses a wife, albeit the second one is a suicide). For that matter we could also be in David Mamet country, specifically the Mamet of The Spanish Prisoner. These cavils to one side The Prestige does entertain with solid performances - even the ubiquitous and over-hyped Scarlett Johannson turns in a half-decent performance and is certainly worth two hours of anyone's time."
" Great ideas and production - weak on personality
",spoiler,"There's so much good in this movie that I hate to write a negative review. The actors were superb and the production was excellent. However, about midway through the movie I was taken with the urge to leave the theater... and I never leave theaters. My best rationale for that feeling is that the movie became so single-mindedly obsessed with revenge that the only thing holding my attention was the secret of the 'trick'.And when I (very proudly) conceived of the notion that there were twins involved, I struggled to reconcile this with Angier's plot. I could not pin it down until the very end for one main reason - after working through an entire movie entrenched in reality and illusion, I could not conceive of some science fiction (deus ex machina) thrown in to solve the problem.What a weak way to end it. Would have been better had Angier waited until his enemy was in the audience and timed it perfectly to kill himself but once - the ultimate sacrifice to frame him for murder. This entire duplicate thing just left me feeling let-down."
" the genius of simplicity
",,"A self confessed movie fanatic, film connoisseur and independent film maker in the making, i have been an avid user of IMDb for as long as an internet connection has graced the back of my modest computer. Yet, never before have i been left so impressed by a film that i feel i absolutely must write a comment on these message boards.This film is outstanding in every way possible. Nolan's direction, slick editing, superb casting and impeccable plot deserve no less than a standing ovation. I was left open mouthed, cemented to my cheap cinema seat, over the moon about the fact i had done my part and donated a portion of my struggling finances to such a well deserved cause.The subject matter is a reflection of the film itself... magical. There surely can never be another film to tackle the subject so well. Any other film maker to even attempt period film about magic will be committing career suicide.The ending... well, i really don't know what to say. The summary line at the top of this comment says it all. In short... Nolan has hit the nail on the f*****g head!!!!"
" Excellent performances, yet poor payoff in the end.
",spoiler,"I must start by say that, ""The Prestige"" is not horrible. Every Performance was done well. I particularly enjoy the protagonist role occasionally switching characters.However, I left from the theater feeling unfulfilled. A strong tool in storytelling is the setup/payoff. You set the audience up for something and then payoff with something totally different, wow factor; i.e. 6th Sense, Momento, Fallen.In a film about the lives of magicians I expected to feel that wow factor. The Prestige fail in that department. I think the blame may fall on the editor shoulders, or a know-it-all maybe forced the filmmakers to make the story more simple. We all know that Mr. Nolan can use that wow factor, like nobody else.The field of top hats and cats, while a powerful and beautiful, should not have been shown until after the last shot. By showing us the hats in the first shot, then again after the cat is cloned; we as the audience knew the trick. But if we had been left in the dark about how it worked until the very last scene the audience would be speechless.Also I felt the plot line connecting Chris's character to Tesla and the machine was moot. Maybe it was supposed to seem that way.Anyway you should see TP none the less to watch an amazing story about a man trying to take the easy road to fame. And maybe you'll feel as I do. 'I can't wait for the director's cut'."
" 5 stars out of 5!
",,"this movie is sixth sense on steroids. there are so many twists and turns that just when the audience gets its footing, they are swept off their feet again. the movie does take a strong stomach, but is well worth the effort. make sure you know who Nickolas Tesla was before watching the film, because his life states theme of the movie, and helps clarify the thematic elements for the audience. i find it ironic that only 50 years past his death does he finally find the success that alluded him in life. the cast is excellent, the screenplay magnificent, and if politics didn't play such a huge part in the academy awards, i would smell Oscar."
" ""The Prestige""'s tricks
",spoiler,"Love Chris Nolan's work (although I liked the original ""Insomnia"" better than his remake)and I went to see ""The Prestige"" yesterday. Liked the movie but I thought it was a little too convoluted for its own good - you should not have to think that hard at the end to figure the movie out; a great surprise ending startles you when you realize how it all came together. Okay, I realize that Bale had a twin and sacrificed him at the end in order to escape jail (but, question, were they alternating sleeping with his wife and his mistress, Scarlett Johansson? I believe the answer is yes)but the final shot involving the dead Jackman in the water trap is still a little confusing. So, Jackman basically died every night and sacrificed a clone of himself, correct? But why was the water cage there anyway? Just to frame Bale's Borden, right? Why didn't Bale's character (who went backstage) seem surprised when Jackman went into a trapdoor and fell into a water cage for what was a transporting trick? Was it that he may have guessed something was up but was powerless to stop it? Also, the transporter machine by Tesla really worked? I thought that perhaps Borden gave Angier the Tesla name to send him on a wild goose chase? Caine's Cutter character did not know that Jackman was killing himself every night? Where did he dispose of the bodies? Also, Cutter was not in cohoots with Bale's Borden, right? He just felt bad that Jackman's character was taking his kid away, right? Did Cutter know that Bale had a twin brother (either early on or at the end?)?"
" Abracadabra ! Skillfullly suspenseful with a strong acting ensemble; Nolan & Nolan make a taut, terrific film-making team
",spoiler,"THE PRESTIGE (2006) *** Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Piper Perabo, Rebecca Hall, Scarlett Johansson, Samantha Mahurin, David Bowie, Andy Serkis, Roger Rees. Absorbing yet predictable tale about two 19th century competitive magicians, one an acclaimed showman (Jackman), the other a dedicated master of the craft (Bale) - who will go at any lengths to top one another in learning each other's secrets and lies at the prestidigitation at hand. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan - who collaborated on the screenplay adaptation of Christopher Priest's novel with his brother Jonathan - expertly weaves a taut tapestry of tension and suspense but for the avid film-goer the 'twists' are all in the open and a tad too obvious. However to the average person this will be a pleasant exercise in edge-of-the-seat suspense and a display of cunningly performed acting by its handsome, dubious leads."
" a basic tale of one-up-manship, but done in a great fashion of professional storytelling and acting
",,"The Prestige is like a machine of tricks and wonders, and it ends up pulling off a lot more than it might have not been able to chew. Co-writer/director Christopher Nolan is very much in his territory here with this picture, and the sort of jigsaw-figure-out effect he had on his breakthrough Memento is redeployed here in a style that is never too deterring. He focuses so well on the two main characters, and the people focused around them, that there's no need to really feel as if one is being pulled away from the real emotional drive of each character. It's basically one big game that becomes something very dangerous once obsession becomes part of it (as Michael Caine's character notes is what children do). But all the while I went along totally well with what the story went through, in all its twists and pulling seemingly simple little turns out of a hat, because Nolan made the storytelling seamless and has actors that are utterly dependable and pitch-perfect in their roles.Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman play the magicians, who start out as partners under the tutelage of Michael Caine's Cutter, who perform acts of not-totally-simple 'magic', which follow three main principles which are listed by Cutter at the start and end of the picture. After a tragedy that befalls their assistant (Piper Perablo), the rivalry and, more crucially, the aims and wills of each side is put into play. On one side is Bale's Borden, who is, according to Jackman's Angier, living his entire life as a trick, which may not be far from the truth (hope that doesn't spoil things). On the other is Angier, who becomes involved with the burgeoning technology of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie, who is one of the lesser factors of actors in the film), who may be able to figure out how to make something truly unbelievable. Their fates become entangled in each side's pursuit to out-do the other in the public eye, with Cutter and the change-around mistress (Scarlet Johanssen, in a spiffy English accent that works), on the sidelines.What makes a lot of this more compelling that it almost has a right to be is how much we're steeped into the mind-sets of these characters, who they get fractured by their own separate ambitions amid their skills. One is a better magician, while the other is a better showman, and each can't stand the other's talents in the midst of being somewhat intrigued and drawn to a kind of madness. And yet at the same time the personal also finds its way into the trickery of the film, and actually grounds things- seemingly of course- particularly with Borden's wife (Rebecca Hall, one of the best in the film acting-wise) who feels betrayed by the pack of lies and secrecy. The fates then of both characters becomes that of dealing with mortality, and how one can cheat death or not, or again, and again. Towards the end it does teeter much on becoming one extra ending that might not be needed, or a couple of minutes that feel packed in too tight.But all the while Jackman and Bale are constantly compelling, with little things they have in their characters that make them very much real for us, and then makes the final twist not too unworthy of what led up to it. It's like a twist mountain, or rather, a prestige. It might not be the best kind of 'prestige' I've seen, yet I still highly recommend it as a cool treat of splendid storytelling in a story that teeters on leaving the audience with too much of a gasp in the extraordinary, and has just enough to pull back and have a few good surprises. It's one of the best productions to come out this season."
" ""A man's reach often exceeds his grasp""
",,"Big fan of Nolan's ever since Memento; I still think his best film thus far is his first full-length feature: Following. The Prestige is undoubtedly his most ambitious film thus far, and it is mesmerizing, no question. By the end, however, I felt that style won out over substance just a bit.Great acting throughout, with Michael Caine being a shoo-in for a Best Supporting Actor nod. Bale (who, like Caine, is always great) and Jackman (who convinced me finally that he can indeed act) are perfectly cast as the dueling magicians. Bowie, I felt, was also perfect as Tesla - an elegant performance from an always-elegant performer.The movie does have those 3 acts, just like in a successful 'trick': the Pledge, the Turn, and the all-important Prestige. This film does deliver on all three, even if it stumbles just a little on the execution."
" Nothing will prepare you...
",spoiler,"I've been contemplating my opinion on this movie for a week now since seeing it with my girl in the theater. After reading both good and bad reviews of it here at IMDb, I'm utterly confused by the people that gave it a 10, and, at the same time, confused by the ones that gave it a 1. Although I'm usually good at figuring out movies' plot twists ahead of the actual explanation (I figured out ""The Others"" within 20 minutes and many more), my girl figured this one out first. I'm sure all the nay-sayers that disliked this movie will call me ""blind"" for that, however, I think the way the story was told is the culprit..and for that I give it EXCELLENT marks. I will break down my review in parts, so as not to lose track:1) The acting was superb. I give high marks all around for each of the characters. Angier (Jackman) started slowly as nothing more than a jealous man, competitive for no other reason than his Y chromosome. And then his jealousy for a talent he did not possess, mixed with hatred for the loss of his wife, drove him to live and die just to beat Borden (Bale) at his own game. Olivia (Johannson) was just right (not a strong role to begin with) to mix up the two competitors. And, of course, Michael Caine is always a strong choice to add to any movie. The biggest-surprise-of-the-movie award, ultimately, must go to David Bowie as Tesla! I grew up watching him in ""Labyrinth"", which was easy for him since he's bizarre to begin with. But to see him play such a solid, striking role and hold his own with veteran actors was fabulous! The folks that had trouble understanding the English accents in this film need to expand their horizons and travel to some other countries instead of sitting on their couches expecting everyone to have perfect ""American"" diction...as if that isn't an oxy-moron! *sigh*2) The sets and costumes were as genuine as they could make them. You had the feeling of being transported in time to a former era, to realize what it's like to live in ""dark times"". The detail and authenticity of the gadgets were above and beyond, in my opinion. I'm not much of one for history, nor magic/illusion, but I've spent enough time backstage and ON stage to know how complex and precise props and gizmos must be.3) Finally, the most difficult item, the PLOT. Although I believe some things could have been changed, again, I give the writer/director high marks for flipping the story around so much that what should be obvious, isn't. It's precisely what magic and illusion is all about, and I believe that was the point. I admit sometimes it was hard to tell what time the scene was in, mainly because the meat of the story is told from a flashback within a flashback. In the PRESENT, Borden is reading a diary of Angier in the PAST while Angier (in the PAST) is reading a diary of Borden in the PAST. Confusing, isn't it? However, if you are the type of viewer that doesn't mind actually thinking during a movie, you'll see it works to its advantage. I can't fathom how some reviews of this movie didn't like Memento either! Poor things probably like to watch perfectly linear stories so they don't have to think too hard. Anyways...after all of the flashbacks play out and we're completing the plot in the PRESENT, we discover some very disturbing things. Originally we figure Angier is the protagonist (who wouldn't want revenge on someone that killed their wife) and Borden is the antagonist (he's in jail for killing Angier), but as Angier slowly loses his way in the flashbacks, so do we. Roles are reversed and the audience becomes torn as to whom they should side with. This is PERFECT! Who do you feel for in the end? Angier for losing his wife and being consumed by his plight for revenge? Borden for making a simple mistake and paying dearly for it? There are just too many lessons to learn from this film if you look closely - Don't judge someone too quickly; Hatred will consume everyone and everything in your life; Never try to steal something just because you don't possess it yourself...earn it; and so on and so forth.To sum up: I will gladly pay the entrance fee for a movie of this caliber any day. It makes you think about yourself and the people around you. It shows you things that, just because they may not be factual, doesn't mean they aren't symbolic. Angier simply bought (the Tesla machine) and stole something (Borden's trick idea) from others to perform his ""tricks"" (revenge). Borden was always the more talented and he LIVED magic along with his twin that had the same passion. Never take anyone for granted (Borden's twin was, Olivia was, Tesla was, Borden's wife was, Cutter was) or their friendship.My opinion is to see this film regardless of what you hear. If you enjoy a twisting and turning journey into the dark parts of humankind's emotions, this ride is for you!"
" are you watching closely?
",,"wow. what a ride. i have to say i was expecting a different movie but it was way better than what i expected. OK so here it goes. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden ( Christian Bale) are friendly magicians who share an act until one night something goes terribly wrong and makes them enemies. Both wont rest until the other outdoes the other or sabotages each others performance. i have to say this is Hugh Jackmans finest performance here as well as Michael Caine as John Cutter the stage engineer. Christian Bale is also good as well as Scarlett Johansson but unfortunately this stunning actress is used much. The Prestige for me is the best movie of the year so far. Hopefully this movie gets recognized at Oscar time. When you see this movie, pay attention very closely cause if you blink you wont get the ending. my jaw dropped at the end. christopher nolan is one of the best directors today and this film shows that. are you watching closely?"
" Excellent film!! Must see again!!!
",,"I've been disappointed with the films that have come out this year, (With only a few exceptions) until I saw ""The Prestige"" this last Saturday. The casting was excellent, the screenplay was spectacular, and to me this film was both eye and mind candy. Director Christopher Nolan (Director and screenplay writer of last summer's box office hit, Batman Begins.) Creates a truly unique and almost surreal atmosphere to the movie that although is artificial, seems as if there is some sort of basis of authenticity whether it's in the screenplay or in its brilliant cinematography shots throughout the film. I believe ""The Prestige"" is Oscar worthy and should get superb recognition for its outstanding quality as a film."
" Multiple Viewings Required
",,"The wayC hristopher Nolan structures this film is the real magic. Multiple viewings are mandatory to see things you missed the first time and for affirmations of what you think are the facts. He and his brother did a great job of adapting a brilliant,fascinating,complex novel of rivalry and obsession that has no limits into a nice movie.Delve deeper in some scenes and all is not what is seems .Some of the critics reviews complain that there is rooting interest for the audience you really don't care for either character. I totally disagree with that I found myself rooting for and against Angier (Jackman) and Borden (Bale ) at various times throughout . This movie is one of my favorites of the year."
" One of the greatest movies i've seen!
",spoiler,"Walking in to the theater i was expecting it to be pretty good (cas lets face it anything with Christian Bale and Michael Caine in it is going to be good), but by the end of the movie, It exceeded my expectations, it was an excellent movie and the film making was brilliant and the acting was phenomenal. Its one of the greatest movies i've ever seen.The twists and turns are unexpecting and the end is far more surprising than the previews lead it to be.Everything about this movie is great. How it was written and directed, how the actors portrayed the characters, down to the costumes and the magic tricks. This movie is a must seen. If you are into illusion and suspense and twist, Go see this movie."
" Watch closely.
",spoiler,"As if I don't already disrespect The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, my bias and unfavorable view of AMPAS will be reinforced if THE PRESTIGE is not at least nominated for Best Original Screenplay. In that category alone, is where the film succeeds. Another tautly written piece of Gothic cinema and heavy drama from Christopher Nolan, and Jonathan Nolan. Good and intense performances from everyone all around, and although Scarlett Johansson is the hottest thing to look at, it was hard for me to adjust to her playing an Englishwoman.The movie takes the audiences behind the scenes in the art of ledgerdemain, but more essentially - behind the intricacies of the relationships of these rivaling performing artists. More than trap doors, and body doubles (although the latter element will be a heavy aspect of the plot, that I say without spoiling much) - each complexity and nuance of the interpersonal relationships in this film are thoroughly explored, without the audience hinting that some of these little details are foreshadowings in themselves that will be exploited as shattering revelations as the film concludes. So pay attention to detail.There may be a little pomp in the SCI-fi element, and I do mean Science Fiction, NOT magic or prestidigital fiction, but the way Nolan crafts the story make it all seem acceptable, and maybe even worthy of your standing ovation because of the tautness of this dark masterpiece. So really, without trying to merely parrot the movie's tagline, I echo it in of my own accord: Watch closely.10/10"
" A Complex Tale of Obsession and Revenge
",,"At the beginning of 'The Prestige', we're told that every magic trick consists of three acts: the pledge, the turn, and the prestige. The first two refer to the setup of the magic trick and then its execution. In the final act, the prestige, something extraordinary occurs that defies logic. The audience is able to confirm with their own eyes that the trick worked and is, therefore, deceived into believing it's real.Magic tricks and magic shows have a lot in common with the art of film-making: in order for a movie to be effective the audience has to be convinced by what they are seeing on the screen. Movies, after all, are nothing more than an act of smoke and mirrors. We go to the movies to be deceived, or perhaps more accurately, to escape from reality.Director Christopher Nolan's latest film, 'The Prestige', succeeds in being a great act of deception. With a complex plot full of twists and turns, we're never sure where the story will take us next. We're also never sure if everything we're being told in the movie is the truth or that everything is real. The film's complex narrative does a great job of building suspense and dramatic tension.'The Prestige' takes place in London at the turn of the twentieth century; a time in which magic shows were still a novelty. The plot revolves around two rival magicians who are obsessed with topping each other's tricks and undermining each other's efforts. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play the two magicians, Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden, respectively. Although they start off as friends and partners, Angier and Borden turn against each other after the tragic death of Angier's wife during a dangerous magic trick. Borden is blamed for her death even though it appears to have been an accident ... or was it? 'The Prestige' is ultimately a story about obsession and revenge. Not only do Angier and Borden come to hate each other, but also they end up harming the ones they love. The pride they take in their work turns into a dangerous obsession. Both magicians are willing to go to incredible lengths to come up with the best magic trick of all time. The question is, how far will they go? The emphasis on magic, however, is only incidental to the story; it could have easily been about any competitive line of work.All the elements are in place for a good movie. The cast, also featuring Michael Caine and Scarlett Johanssen in supporting roles, is uniformly great. Christian Bale, in particular, gives an Oscar worthy performance; he's one of the best actors of his generation and really shines here. The directing is top-notch as well, featuring beautiful cinematography and convincing sets. This should come as no surprise, however, considering the fact that director Christopher Nolan has a good track record when it comes to movies. Having previously directed 'Memento' and 'Batman Begins', Christopher Nolan has impressed both audiences and film critics.Some viewers may object to the film's complicated narrative. The story, told in flashbacks, can get confusing and sometimes makes absolutely no sense. I'm sure if one pays close enough attention, they'll see a plot hole or two. I'm willing to forgive this, however, because I appreciated the movie for its audaciousness and sense of style.This is the second major Hollywood release in only a couple of months to be about magicians in turn-of-the-century Europe. The other being 'The Illusionist', starring Edward Norton. I have seen both films now and can say that 'The Presige' is the better of the two. It's got a more engaging story and stronger direction.'The Prestige' is a great spectacle. Featuring a wonderful cast and top-notch production values, the film succeeds as an unforgettable cinematic experience."
" Well worth the money
",,"I had seen a number of reviews of The Prestige and they were all giving it an extremely high rating, even from reviewers who are notorious for giving low ratings, so I went into this movie with very high expectations and was not disappointed. There is plenty of time for character-building as the movie runs over 2 hours, but do not fear, this movie is not filled with ""filler material."" From the opening credits to the final credits, you are enthralled with what is happening on screen. This is not a high-action movie, but it does contain tense scenes that get you to sit on the edge of your seat. As the final credits began, the theatre that I was in broke out into spontaneous applause, something that I have only experienced with one other movie (and that was a premiere night).The movie centers around two rival magicians who are friends at the beginning of the movie, but due to an unfortunate incident, they become bitter rivals. They then seek to ""better"" each other as they develop the ""ultimate"" trick. The movie takes place in turn of the century London and is very pleasurable to watch.With so many movies coming out these days, it is difficult to pick one from the rest, but The Prestige jumps out as one that should be seen. BUT be warned ...this movie has a number of twists and you should be careful of what you read or listen to prior to watching it. If the twists are revealed .. it would certainly spoil the experience for you."
" Good but not good enough
",,"The production is wonderful and the acting very good. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale both do great work here, and Michael Caine is exceptional. Scarlett Johansson is good, too, but she is underused in this male-dominant film. There is a lot of twists and turns, but the problem is, they also give away a lot of clues, right from the beginning shots, so if you have paid attention (and who wouldn't, once you enter the theater knowing you're about to see a mystery/thriller about magic), halfway through you would know how the story is going to end and what is happening. That's the problem with the film. With every great magic trick, you can't tell how it's done even if you look very closely. It's not the case with this film -- it's predictable once you figure it out, and it's not difficult.It's not to say it's not enjoyable. The crosscutting, non-linear time lines can be confusing at first, but the director is smart enough to leave you visual clues so once you find your marks, the technique is interesting, keeping the twists close to the vest for the audiences. But once again, they leave you enough clues that if you have paid attention, you will figure it out. David Bowie is fun to watch, though -- I didn't even recognize it was him (although I recognize Mr. Gollum). Another problem is that the film focuses on the rivalry and the oneupmanship, and it feels cold. Compared to the Illusionist, which I think is a superb romantic mystery, the story and ending of The Prestige are less than emotionally rewarding. It's like a nice magic trick -- it will leave you giddy, full of wonder and imagination, but ultimately empty emotionally."
" awesome movie
",,"This is an awesome movie, with non stop suspense that will keep you guessing to the very end. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackaman have really out done them selves in this movie. The day that this movie comes out on DVD it will be mine. Once you think you have the whole movie figured out, it will pull a 180 and totally fool you. The director does a great job of keeping the suspense intense through out the whole movie. He also does a nice job on flashing back to past and present to not confuse the audience. I loved how when you saw the future and you noticed something odd about the character that wasn't shown in the past. It foreshadows something on its way to come that you keep looking for. If you have 10$ maybe even 20$ that you want to spend I would definitely go see this one."
" Great film, lacked focus
",,"I thought the movie itself keeping all logicality aside was a very good film, however I found it contradicted itself in the movie. On one hand the movie was talking about how there was always an answer to magic , however the whole re-making of oneself put into the movie totally contradicted itself . That wasn't logical and impossible. I found the way the whole movie was put together very well, however it should have stuck to one main theme. I would still recommend seeing this movie, you won't feel bored, however, it doesn't have a strong idea. The flow of the movie is very good, and the ending extremely well done. Definiatley one of the best movies i have seen this past year."
" Great Movie, A lot of twist and turns and oh's and aw's and the most
",,"Great Movie, A lot of twist and turns and oh's and aw's and the most unpredictable of endings.Bale's and Jackman's best film and best acting yet. All the acting was on point and it only added to the great storyline, great plots, and great characters. And it didn't leave not one plot hole and for a movie like this that's is an amazing feat. The movie keeps you right on the edge of your seat the whole way right up until the end. You will never see what's coming and thats why its so shocking. I would rank this movie with the best of the best, and thats including Saw II.This is a MUST SEE!I will definitely be seeing this movie a third or fourth time."
" A Film with Intellect
",,"I thought this was an amazing film. It takes a period before the advent of the illusionist pyrotechnics of modern times and shows us the magic. Not only does it have the magic working for it, it has a great story of revenge, hatred, one-upsmanship, genius, you name it. The story teaches us about illusion which is a much more accurate term for what we see. I will never look at David Copperfield the same way again. There is incredible scenic effluence. The acting is impeccable and the direction and cinematography is unrivaled. For once a film that lives up to its hype. Using David Bowie as Tesla is marvelous. I've always thought that he should have had a much greater career as an actor than he has realized. Michael Caine is the voice of reason, but his voice is seldom listened to. Revenge is one of the oldest motives and it poisons one of the characters. Stay with this one; then see it again. It is a masterpiece."
" Now this is a movie!
",,"This movie was not quite what I was expecting. It was even better by a few leaps and bounds. There was nothing cliché about it. Even at the end there was no real good guy or bad guy. No clear moral lesson. The characters and story were kept very human. What I thought might end up a fantastical unbelievable story was very real and even thought provoking. There was only one fantastical element to the film but it was still presented in such a way as to not take away from the characters themselves and the drama between them. The acting was also very impressive. I never doubted the characters for a minute. Not a one. The run time is kind of long. However,unlike Peter Jackson's King Kong I was never bored, never just waiting for the story to pick up. I don't see how it could be a serious complaint and really it's the only thing approaching one that I've heard about this great film. I really have no complaints about this movie. If you have not had the pleasure of seeing it I highly recommend you do."
" Comme ce comme ca (so-so)
",,"This movie is not bad. This movie is not good. The costumes are great, the movie stars beautiful (it was worth $5 for a matinée glimpse of Jackman without his shirt on), the acting superb (I mean..Michael Caine; it doesn't get any better than that).But the plot is convoluted and hard to follow. It jumps back and forth, with the audience finding themselves trying to place whether this is in the past, the present, or the future. It also assumes the audience will relate to an obsession of the sort detailed in this movie. I didn't.The movie was interesting, well worth the reduced matinée price of a movie, and the actors rose to their peak levels for a movie of this sort. But ultimately, it seemed to me that a group of suits sat around a table, made a list of some movie star names, and said, ""What movie can we create to have all these guys in the same movie and really pack the audience in?"" They ended up with a movie created for these performers, rather than a great movie, the cast for which was pulled from a list of excellent actors.How it would have been better: A better script, tighter, shorter, a bit less convoluted. Photography - there were far too many extreme closeup shots. It would have been better if they had made some of those extreme closeups more full body or upper body shots, so that the audience could see the body language and maybe the other person the actor was communicating with. Not that there weren't great extreme closeups. And not that I mind seeing Hugh Jackman's eyes in closeup. It's just that there were too many such shots.I expected more from Bale, Jackman, and Caine. Like I said, it was good, not bad. But I would've thought that these three powerweights of Hollywood could have commanded an excellent script and an award winning movie. They didn't hit it with this one."
" Are you watching closely?The Prestige
",,"Well it appears Oscar season is upon us. The release of all the films studios have been hiding from projectors until they can be freshly ingrained in voters' minds has commenced. We had the obligatory Scorsese film a couple weeks ago and now we have the return of one of Hollywood's new favorite sons (who also began with intelligent and original indie visions like Marty) with Christopher Nolan's The Prestige. Known for uniquely dark and smart suspense thrillers, Nolan has crafted a tale of mysterious intrigue concerning two rival magicians vying to be the greatest to have ever lived. One is a performer of high esteem (Hugh Jackman), if not talented enough to create his own tricks, and the other a wizard with sleight of hand (Christian Bale) yet stoic and matter-of-fact with his audience. Obsession overcomes the humanity of each as they soon delve into the darkness of their core beings to prove themselves superior. If you truly wish to succeed, you must be willing to get your hands dirty.I must say that I usually hate figuring out a movie's secret before its' big reveal at the conclusion. To say that Nolan has laid his out for all to see purposely might not be far from the truth. I hope he has done so consciously as it adds immensely to the film's enjoyability. This is a film about illusion and tricks that can be explained if necessary. The beauty of magic, however, is the audience's unconscious desire to never find out what really happened. As one character says in the film, it becomes so obvious once the trick has been unraveled. What a movie like The Illusionist failed to do was accept the intelligence of its audience. They tried so hard to hide the telestrated finale that when it finally happened you felt cheated. Nolan understands what is so appealing about illusion, we want to figure out what happens ourselves, to see the obvious and apply it to the cloaked result. He tells the tale like a magic trick, showing his hand the entire way yet still being able to keep the film suspenseful and enjoyable right to the final frame as we wait to see what direction we are led.Bale and Jackman prove themselves to be the heavyweights that they are in the acting field. They embody their characters fully and are able to go from friendly comradery to bitter hatred throughout the course of this labyrinthine story bouncing from flashback to flashback. The rivalry is tautly told as they begin to discover a new layer of the other with each diary page turn, stolen from their counterpart. These are actors playing performers who have chosen a life for themselves, where they must act every single day. Their personas for stage and family are not the same, and this disparity helps to slowly destroy them both. Sacrifice and pain will always supercede love and happiness for a person driven to be the best at what they do.Surprising applause goes to Scarlett Johansson for a performance that doesn't try to be more than it is. She is not bad as a supporting character when there isn't much for her to destroy. The half-smile/pursed lips look runs rampant, but doesn't reek amateurism as it usually does when she attempts to carry a film herself. The true supporting roles, however, lie with Andy Serkis and David Bowie as assistant to and Nikola Tesla respectively. It is a real shame that Bowie doesn't act more, as I have never seen a bad performance from him thus far after now five films. He embodies the mysterious enigma that Tesla was: a mad-scientist of sorts trying to help the world with his often-irregular ideas. It is also a pleasure to see Serkis not being just a prop like he has been as Golem and King Kong in Peter Jackson's last two epics. The guy has some real screen presence and the ability to transform into whatever a director needs for his film.It is also good to see Nolan go back to the inventive storytelling that he became noticed for. While not as intricate as his debut Following (told in a story pattern consisting of three timeframes going a, b, c, a, b, c) and his masterpiece sophomore effort Memento (told backwards in small chunks), The Prestige is not a straight-forward story like his last film Batman Begins or the lone-blemish on his resume, the inferior remake to a great Norwegian suspenser, Insomnia. The use of flashback, while both characters read the diary of each other, is a nice device which never feels gimmicky. These are stories of intelligent men and who better to narrate for the audience then the leads themselves as they narrate for each other. Dark thrillers don't come better than this one very often and while the touches of science fiction and the supernatural may turn some realists off towards the film's conclusion, I believe they work well within the confines of the world we are being shown. Every sacrifice taken is the obvious conclusion to its' string of events, leading up to the final dénouement that will leave your minds in contemplation, not from confusion so much as an evaluation of your own ways of living and lengths you are willing to go, for hours to follow."
" Seeing is Believing
",,"The ability to fool a large group of people. The power to force someone into seeing something. The art of illusion. Illusionists, magicians, no matter what they are called they consider themselves one thing; performers. To be the best means to work the hardest and to commit fully to an act. Sometimes, the illusion becomes too real.How far will someone go for power? How much is enough? How far are you willing to go? In turn of the century London, filmmaker Christopher Nolan brings answers these questions and brings us into a world full of betrayal, murder, and of course, magic. Two rival magicians vie for power to see who really is the best. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) along with his associate Cutter (Sir Michael Caine) are puzzled by Robert's former colleague's latest trick. Alfred (Christian Bale) has unveiled a brilliant new illusion that defies expectation. Robert's assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) is willing to do anything for him, even infiltrate Alfred's act.This feuding was the result of a trick gone wrong involving Robert's wife. Alfred appeared to be the one to blame and Robert never let it go. Rather than leaving the past behind, the two go back and forth to try and out perform the other on stage and off. What was once a friendship has turned into an all out war of secrets. Robert, who will give anything to outsmart his competitor, travels all the way to America to seek the help of a scientist and pull off the amazing trick his own way.Nolan after the success of Batman Begins reunites with Bale and Caine to tackle a new setting. Nolan's previous works of notoriety, Memento and Insomnia, all have a similar edge to them. The Prestige is not different. The storyline is jumpy, going from present to the beginning, to the middle, and all over the place. Pieced together, the flow makes sense and is a joy to undertake.With a solid script from Nolan and his brother Jonathon, all that was needed was a cast. Academy Award winner Caine, along with Jackman, Bale, Johansson, and a cameo by David Bowie, make The Prestige marvelous. Exceptional performances by Jackman and Bale make the rivalry intense and exciting.The story strictly speaking is superb. The Nolan brothers have delivered once again. Their style and flow are truly original. It is hard to jump around in a film and pass on the message and information as cleanly as possible. The story leads up to a dramatic and climactic ending that will not soon be forgotten.The Prestige is not a run of the mill birthday magic show. It is a fantastic voyage into the realm of magic, both the light the dark sides."
" Wild, Intelligent, Challenging, and Entertaining
",spoiler,"Nolan does it again. He creates a cerebral, mysterious, and very entertaining thriller that is original and keeps his audience interested for two hours, without talking down to its audience or passing tired remakes as something worth their time. Here is a film based on literature, on vibrant and original characters, with actors who can show others what is like to inhabit their roles and do their best every time they on screen. Both Bale and Jackman are at the top of their game, complementing what the other does in order to put on quite a show, pretty much like the protagonists in the story, they appear to be outdoing each other, but in reality they are just both doing work that enhances and makes the entire film a joy to watch.Without revealing many of the exciting surprises in the film, it is possible to give a brief summary of what works: an amazing script by Nolan his brother that gives rivalry a new twisted perspective. Here is a couple of men obsessed with fame and the new challenging, out to outdo each other and to avenge some perceived wrongs. As the film unwinds or winds tighter (depending on how you perceive its development), one follows each of the two ""magicians"" as they try to discover each other secrets, unlocking them and finding revelations that might not be too palatable as they reveal much more of their true nature.What the film carries beyond the charming ""Illusionist"" is the furious dedication and obsession that lies in the heart of every true ""professional"". Bale is a natural and knows how to create and develop an illusion, and illusion is the key word here. The more theatrical performer, portrayed by Jackman, is willing to integrate technology and to learn from his mistakes. What hampers his progress is the constant and dangerous competition by Bale's Borden.The film never cheats his audience. In fact, it gives us all the answers, and then it ups the level of curiosity by taking us along a ride that resembles a maze, and where nothing is what it seems. It is a challenging film to watch, and the only regret is watching its conclusion, not because it's a letdown, but because it means the ride is over, or is it?"
" Nolan's best to date
",,"The Prestige was better than i expected, and i expected it to be good. It played out quite a bit differently from how i guessed it would from previews and what i'd read, etc. the rivalry between the magicians gets increasingly vicious and creates a great sense of impending doom again and again. It is hinted that there is a similar rivalry happening between Thomas Edison and Tesla (David Bowie) that i thought was a very nice touch. great performances from everyone, and even Scarlett Johanneson can't screw this one up.I've enjoyed all his movies so far (especially Batman Begins and Following), and i'd have to say this is Christopher Nolans best to date. i'll admit i sorta went into this one just to see what these people have been up to between Batman movies, but i wasn't thinking about The Dark Knight at all when we left the theatre. This will also likely be one that improves upon multiple viewings i'm sure."
" Bwa-ha--ha-ha! It's not London, it's BURBANK!!!!!!
",,"Amazingly, this picture (which purports to be set in Victorian London) was actually filmed entirely in Hollywood, California, or actually Burbank. Excuse me...with the exception of some Colorado mountain exteriors. Warner lot, you can read it in the credits. This is truly Hollywood magic at work.I am glad to see so many people enjoying a film that has at least a modicum of smarts to it. I enjoyed this picture for its performances and its intelligence. I genuinely did not know where this picture was going to go, and it held my interest the entire time. I had a good time at the movies with this one, and I hope you do, too."
" Best Movie That I've Seen Since Usual Suspects
",,"This is my first comment, or review of a movie, so bare with me.The Prestige, this movie was EXCELLENT, gave it a 10, two thumbs up, best movie I've seen since Usual Suspects. Mad me want to go back in and watch it again, to catch clues. I'm not going to give up any spoilers because you should watch it on your own. I'm becoming a big fan of Christopher Nolan (have Memento, but never watched it, now later on tonight, I'm definitely going to watch it). His direction, just sweeps you into the movie until it lets you go at the end, and just has you saying what happened. When I first heard about him and Batman Begins, I said to myself, couldn't be any worse than Batman Forever. However, with the Prestige, the direction was great, and just keep you intrigued about it. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman (Batman vs Wolverine, LOL, jokin)..just played just NASTY rivals until the end. You believe that these two actors truly just hated each other for reasons that you really understood. I'm not going to say this should be Oscar nominated and blah blah blah, however, it's a movie worth your time. It's a movie where you just feel you are right there, at that time set, in the audience watching the magician, watching these two wonderful actors, play out their roles."
" An otherworldly great film
",,"The Prestige is a great film. It is wonderful, thought provoking, challenging, intense, mysterious, complex and sad. It has a great director, a great cast, incredible writing, fantastic production and once again, Christian Bale is exemplary. There are films that you say to yourself ""I will not see a better film this year"" or ""this is one of the best movies I have ever seen"". Thats the kind of film that this is. I hope that The Prestige finds great success because to me it is what a movie is all about, a transporting and moving experience. Its what I hope for every time I have the opportunity to see a new film. Go. Now. See it!"
" 'The Prestige' is a riveting suspense-drama that will have even the most avid movie-goers in wonderment at its outcome!
",,"Christopher Nolan has been on the brink of penetrating Hollywood's elite silver circle of directors since his second feature-film, 'Memento,' which caught the attention of audiences and critics alike and became an instant cult classic. After the tremendous success that was 'Batman Begins,' he assured movie-fanatics across the nation that he was for real. 'The Prestige,' a marvelously directed era extravaganza with top-notch acting and a beguiling script, tells one of the fiercest tales of jealousy, obsession and loathsome rivalry. Christian Bale delivers a tantalizing performance as Alfred Borden, the stories superior magician that lacks the showmanship to be the greatest. Jackman's performance is the perfect counterpoint as he plays the envious adversary who's willing to do anything to uncover his foe's methods. From a technical standpoint, this thriller is nearly faultless, and Nolan magically keeps his audience guessing until the final shot. 'The Prestige' is a riveting suspense-drama that will have even the most avid movie-goers in wonderment at its outcome! Are you watching closely?"
" An entertaining watch, but unfortunately thin and repetitive
",spoiler,"Christopher Nolan's recent films (""Memento,"" ""Insomnia,"" and ""Batman Begins"") have all been based on the same theme: The power of obsession to increase a person's ability to create and destroy simultaneously. However, while those earlier films also explored other subjects (respectively, the importance of objective reality as opposed to subjective memory, the line between proving someone's guilt and framing him, and whether action or belief defines a person), ""The Prestige"" is entirely about the single theme. The biggest problem with this difference is that Nolan does not wring enough interesting aspects out of the theme to build an entire film--it only shows us the effects of the obsessions on our main characters instead of exploring the effects any further and it even includes an archetypal wise older character who has already lived it in the person of Nikola Tesla to give one of our heroes advice and give the film's themes voice in case anyone hasn't noticed being beaten over the head with it.However, beyond the thematic (and thus intellectual) weaknesses, ""The Prestige"" does offer an entertaining watch. It's obvious from early on that the main purpose of the film is to provide us with a plot that will surprise the audience again and again by pulling the rug out from under it, so to speak, and it is fun to watch the attempted surprises, even though they don't in general work out. Since such attention is drawn to the effect of a magic trick in which something has to be made to disappear and then returned, both surprisingly, one has to expect something similar to happen with one of the characters at the end, and of course it does. There are also a number of points (especially the moment when Angier's wife says that he is ""pretending to be someone else"" because he changed his name and the moment when the two magicians see the old ""Chinaman"" who pretends to be crippled) where the only real point seems to be to lay out a piece of the puzzle for later and these moments unfortunately make the ending's false bottoms too obvious and easy to predict.The acting, meanwhile, is quite good. Christian Bale's part does not require much, but the few scenes that require a stretch are performed admirably. The same can be said of both Michael Caine and Scarlett Johansson. However, the true star of the show is undoubtedly Hugh Jackman, who has easily the deepest and most interesting character in Angiers and performs him quite excellently. The only real complaint I have in this department is David Bowie's Nikola Tesla--even ignoring the terrible accent, Bowie performs Tesla as a simple, one-note character while the real-life Tesla at this time in his life was bordering on being a total raving lunatic. Certainly Bowie is not to blame entirely for the mischaracterization, but he could have, especially considering who he is, brought more lunacy to the performance and certainly added something to the film's picture of obsession and to his warnings about it.On a final note, the film's score can be easily described in one word: dreadful.So, all told, this is a fun watch for someone who just wants a fun plot that's acted well and looks decent (Nolan does have a good eye), but it doesn't offer much more for the brain or the more trained cinematic eye. A one-watch-then-throw-away film, unfortunately, from a director who has the talent to do much better. Hopefully Nolan's obsession with obsession doesn't take him down any further."
" Excellent movie, great twists and all around great acting
",,"This movie was mearly mentioned to me by a friend. He claimed the movie would be awesome. He couldn't have been anymore right. From the get go, I admit the movie was a bit slow, but thats when the twists were thrown at you piece by piece. After that, this movie took off. The premise was amazing, and the acting was superb. I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys...well... A great movie! This movie is definitely #1 on my list for the best movies of 2006. Go see this movie, observe it, watch it, and you will come out of the theater the same way I did, STUNNED. Enjoy this movie to the fullest. You will experience a movie that will blow your mind."
" Best movie in a long time!
",,"This is the first movie that I have seen that i wanted to start watching again as soon as it ended. It keep me guessing and second guessing myself if was wonderful. I loved all the twist and turns and that it made me actually think. I had a good discussion with my friends for a half an hour after just to get what what really happened and we are still not sure if we are right. The movie follows the 3 parts of a magic act. The pledge, at first you think you know whats going on and it seems normal enough but then you get to the second part the turn, here the ordinary become something spectacular and the prestige were you look for the secret but wont find it. They did a wonderful job of incorporating this into the movie and making the movie its self almost a magic act. If you don't like to think this probably isn't the movie for you."
" dark, but very cool
",,"i'll keep this shorti loved it, i knew i it would be great simply from the cast and the director. i wasn't expecting it to be quite this dark but i loved every minute of it and was happy it was done this way. Nolen does a great job of setting up the ending of this movie to keep you guessing how it would be done. I guessed some of it but was surprised by other parts. I thought Andy Serkis and David Bowe were great. After seeing it at the late showing i had trouble sleeping b/c i was still trying to replay the movie in my mind to understand all the twists and turns.Great Movie, a must see"
" Proves magic can be boring
",,"For all the magic, all the tricks, and all the twists and turns this convoluted plot takes, it ultimately fails at creating cinematic magic: providing the audience with an emotionally satisfying experience.Did this film need to be so long? Did it need to be so complicated? It opens and closes with an explanation about how magic tricks are performed in order to truly amaze the audience. Ironically the screenwriter did not familiarize himself with the basic rules of writing movie scripts. The script suffers from several defects:1. It drags on too long and falters eventually. By the end the audience is too bored to even care about what is supposed to be a fantastic climax. Unfortunately, it ends up being an anti-climax.2. We do not really care about characters. We can't relate to so many of them anyway. Nobody can. Especially if they are not interesting. The bottom line is that no one in this film is interesting, except perhaps David Bowie as the genius Tesla. Unfortunately he doesn't really do much and the whole subplot with him, like so much else in this film, is unnecessary.3. There is no message in this film. The whole rivalry story is unpersuasive, both in terms of motivation for the characters, and in terms of internal logic. The final speech given by the protagonist that is supposed to reveal his deep yearnings and the demonic force that has made him create the whole orgy of senseless violence, comes down to... Well, watch and see. You will be disappointed.4. As I said, there is a persistent lack of logic. Why do these guys do what they do? Why do they invest all their lives in rivalry and hiding secrets from one another, yet can't seem to predict that the other one might try and sabotage their act? It is very hard to follow this film when one cannot empathize with the characters, understand their deep motivations, or figure out why they keep doing stupid things over and over again. Even the climax of the film includes some unbelievably stupid decisions made by the protagonist. Can this master of deceit not predict that the other guy might come after him? Maybe the screenwriter should have spent less time inventing complicated tricks and focused more on some basic logic.In sum, I feel empty after watching this film, and would not recommend it to anyone. It sets up a potentially interesting story, it takes us through more than two hours of plot, and it somehow fails to deliver a worthy climax - or, should I say, 'prestige'? One out of ten stars."
" Major plot holes(coincidences)
",spoiler,"the movie had one unrealistic event apart from Tesla's duplicating machine, which really downgraded my fancy towards the movie. it was the coincidence that Christian bale(Freddie) used Tesla's as his code word and the fact that Tesla's machine also worked. if someone will argue that Hugh Jackman knew it works all along then why he was surprised while reading the Dalton(Hugh Jackman) journal that Tesla's machine could actually work also when lord cal don(Hugh Jackman) came to see him he was surprised as to how he(the great Danton) was still alive.i think it was well thought out and brilliant movie but that's one hard to swallow COINCIDENCE in the movie."
" Another shameless copy of Nolan
",,"Illusionist > prestige
Paprika> inception
Zorro+ Gwyplaine = Overrated trash Knight trilogy"
" Frankly, this is one movie I'll never watch again
",,"Complete waste of time. Pretentious direction, hokey dialogue, far-fetched story, and two unconvincing leaders.A disaster of an overlong and futile film that I refuse to watch ever again."
" The Best Movie Ever!
",spoiler,"This movie is a mixed bag entirely. That's the truth, it's horribly over-rated but seems to revel in the fact that everything it does should work but somehow it just doesn't. The problem lies in that the movie has two sections, the majority of the story then the onslaught of twists at the end and one ruins the other effectively.The characters are the strongest point with them all succeeding in creating a tense atmosphere of rivalry and obsession but the stand out is Christian Bale. He is clearly the best actor here coming across as the only 100% legitimate character, he truly becomes his character but seems to have little screen time compared to Hugh Jackman.The twists at the end are a mixed bag. There is some great twists early on featuring the notebook and other things but the number of twists at the end overwhelm the story. The big twist around Bale's character is interesting and worthy of Nolan's Memento but the rest are rather boring. The other big twist is mixed. It was a plot point that could have worked without requiring an explanation as the film's tone up to this point could have worked with a vague explanation - one that doesn't tell you the exact truth but leaves you slightly puzzled and satisfied (as in Memento) but instead the film opts to give us a drastic change of tone to ruin this ambiguity. This was a bad move by Nolan as the entire plot changes once you know this and means that this renders the rest of the film pointless in its strange feel and tone. A science-fiction twist in an historical / character film is not a good idea.The rest of the characters are also a mixed bag. Hugh Jackman's character is basically a far less interesting version of Bale's character and his performance is not much to talk about. Michael Caine knows how to act and shows it here, he does a fine job and Scarlett Johansson doesn't really impress. Her story arc is interesting but does little to make her short screen time interesting.The twists are a problem. End of story. The twists are good, the rest of the film is good but the tonal change just doesn't gel together. The moment when the character of the Lord is revealed was the best twist by far and here is why: it is simple. In that one moment everything looked good, the vagueness was present, you understand the hopelessness of one character and the success of another and yet the shot lasted about 5 seconds. I would have loved it if the film had ended there, 10/10, but no it decides to explain this twist in so much detail it loses sight of what made the first half of the film amazing.Personally I do however think it is a great movie.Well it was a great movie up until the ending.The ending actually wasn't bad it just made the rest of the part irrelevant.The film is over-rated but it is good.And this review is effectively how the movie works. It tells you everything out of order, jumbles it up, seems a bit vague and then can't make up its mind how to end itself and lies about what you saw at the beginning. It isn't the best movie ever ... just very over-rated.Or is it? Or was that a lie? Or ..."
" Must Watch
",,"I will be short and sweet:this movie is SUPERB!everything about it is just perfect for the true movie fan:storyline,acting(being from Serbia I was especially taking notice of David Bowie and I was very pleased by his portrait of Nikola Tesla),suspense,mystery...I have always liked Christian Bale,but now I am stunned by his acting.Jackman is a fine rival from beginning to the surprising end :)I love movies where you have to activate your brain cells and watch really closely so you don't miss anything.And this movie does that in it's best way.It will get you intrigued,curios and wanted to know and see more.So get a DVD,pull up your chairs...and ARE YOU WATCHING CLOSELY? ;)"
" Magical
",,"I have to say that I was a moderate fan of Nolan's work before seeing this movie. I bought the Blu-Ray edition last month so I had seen Inception, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight way before this movie. Now I enjoyed both Batman movies and absolutely loved Inception, but when I started watching this movie, it just caught my attention in a way that when it ended, it felt like it was only 15-minutes long. now I find myself ""tearing"" movie stores upside-down to see all Nolan's work.With this movie it's evident why Nolan likes to work with Michael Caine (one of the best in the movie) and I had the opportunity to see Hugh Jackman in a different way, rather than smoking cigars and clawing everything in the way. Absolutely loved his performance. Let's not forget, however, Christian Bale, which, in my opinion, performed greater than in Batman Begins and Dark Knight. The story is very addictive and easily understandable and has some memorable moments. If you ever seen ""The Illusionist"", with Edward Norton, and you liked it, you'll be blown away with ""The Prestige"".Oh and the ending? Absolutely fantastic.Truly a ""must"" for every Nolan fan, and for everyone who loves a great movie."

" Sumptuous, intriguing, but flat characterisation
",,"Christopher Nolan's sumptuous film, 'The Prestige', tells the story of two warring magicians, each obsessed with each other's trick. The film cleverly uses its subject matter to create a mystery story; and as with all magic tricks, the question as to what is real remains open until the very end. There's even an inventive walk-on part for Nikolai Tesla, the real life creator of the alternating current. The film has weaknesses - in some ways, the two magicians are two similar, I wasn't enamoured of Christian Bale's performance, and perhaps at the end, more could have been made of the fundamental difference between true magic and a trick - the film explains (at least partly), but there's a certain lack of moral resonance. But like all good shows, it lures you in - and the longer you watch, the more you want to find out what's really going on."
" Nolan's masterpiece!
",,"Wow, I didn't see this one coming. It's been quite a while since I've been surprised by the quality of a movie like this. It kept me guessing and engrossed from beginning to end. The way that the narrative shifts back and forwards in time can be a little hard to follow on the initial viewing, but that's the only possible negative that I could ever think of, for The Prestige.There have been many comparisons made between The Illusionist and The Prestige, and understandably so. They were released not very far apart. They both deal with magicians, and pushing the boundaries of what is considered illusion and what is considered real. Both of them have solid casts (though the absurdly excellent actors in The Prestige could easily be described by a stronger word than ""solid""), captivating stories, and twisting plots. But, while The Illusionist is merely great, this movie is basically flawless in my eyes. The story got better and better and better as it went on, topping itself again and again. The movie keeps improving with repeated viewings, as well. You'll pick up on clues that you probably completely missed the first time around. Needless to say, I was blown away by the ending. It bears repeating that at the actors and actresses are marvelous. I'm gushing, I know. You get it by now, I love this movie. Even after a few years and several viewings, I still enjoy every moment of it.I LOVE THE PRESTIGE!    "
" Fails in lot of levels.
",spoiler,"Spoiler alert!Christoper Nolan did not know this,or did not wanted to tell himself:supernatural elements just changing the situation,at all.But if I'am wrong when this is my opinion,why was that twist too important at the end.And that was not a serious twist.Acting:good,the actors are not guilty,they just wanted to earn money,as usually we know females get some sentences,in the old role,OK what could women do in England in that age.The message is acceptable,but this film was not full of joy,I don't know how the novel did,and what Christoper Nolan and he's brother changed while they wrote the screenplay,but this film is NOT A GOOD FILM.This screenplay is not a good screenplay.3/10"
" Sleight of hand
",spoiler,"SPOILERS, SPOILERS, SPOILERS.It took me no time at all to realise that the obvious solution to Christian Bale's ""Transported Man"" trick was that he had a twin. And scene after scene confirmed this: You know, main character always shot in a way you couldn't really see him, in shadow, big hair, big hat. But it took me quite some time to realise that this was merely a distraction that audiences were supposed to cling on to, in order to distract them from the real trick in the film. What a disappointment then, that the real trick was a fantasy element, a piece of supernatural design that undermined the point of the film: that everything in magic is illusion. The final trick was no trick at all, but a chunk of science fiction. ***MAIN SPOILER *** Hugh Jackman persuades the scientist Tesla to create a machine that clones him. In his final 100 performances, he repeatedly clones himself and commits suicide so that his clone lives and Christian Bale can be accused of his murder. Quite how one distinguishes between who is the real person when a clone is manufactured is glossed over. But clearly, as far as the film is concerned, when the original version of you dies, you live on in the clone. This might have been acceptable in the key scene where Jackman creates his first clone, had the outcome been different. In the movie, Jackman immediately shoots the clone dead. And yet conversely, his final trick is based on him dying and the clone surviving. Perhaps if in that key scene, Jackman had put the gun to his own head and committed suicide, so that he lived on in the clone, then that science fiction concept might have had some credibility. As it is, the scene seems to become another attempt to try and confuse the audience, leaving me with a distasteful set of plot-holes to ponder, rather than accepting a stunningly designed and shocking finale."
" Keeps you guessing!
",spoiler,"The first time that I watched this movie, I had became interested immediately as I am a big fan of Hugh Jackman. Each and every actor played their respective parts well. Basically, there are two rival magicians and they're both trying to out do each other, what happens is that they both sabotage their rivals' acts. This leads them both to a driving obsession that takes over their lives. They both become so obsessed with magic that they don't seem to notice everything else in life. At the end of the film all of the twists come out... and the film becomes very, very interesting after that. You have to watch it twice to understand the entirety of the film."
" ""The Prestige"": How to make a masterpiece
",,"What's ""The Prestige""? It's an incredible film about two man rivalries. A perfect film with magical performances of all the actors: Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman make a memorable performance and Michael Caine is Spectacular! Scarlet Johanson gives to us her pretty and her talented to act. David Bowie is interesting. Andy Serkis is strange, being another creature that it isn't Gollum or King Kong. With a fantastic direction and screenplay from Christopher Nolan: a person who I want to say thanks for films like ""Memento"" or ""Batman Begins"". The set, the costumes, the cinematography are so good too. The soundtrack takes to us into the film. The Prestige is a masterpiece to never forget. The academy ignored this film, but all of we know that's a very very good movie."
" A Cult Classic!!! Masterpiece Perfection!!!
",,"Let me start of with saying that I am a HUGE fan of Christopher Nolan. but even by his high standards, Prestige took me completely by surprise. having immensely enjoyed his Memento and Insomnia, I was expecting nothing short of such a path-breaking effort. But Prestige is a masterpiece. a once-in-a-lifetime movie. U may not see one like this again. And if you do, rest assured, it will be from Nolan. The film is about the ever-lasting rivalry between two magicians. One,a gifted showman - the other, a true magician. The story is quite a simple one.It deals with various attempts by the two to outdo each other-by hook or crook. But what happens when one of them unveils the greatest magic trick ever? What could the other one possibly do to rival or out-perform such a great feat?!!! Watch The Prestige. And like u may well expect, Nolan doesn't go with any conventional narration techniques. He chooses his own cult method and the result is a deliciously twisted, dark, and dramatic tale that keeps you guessing until the end titles roll. It is very important for a film like this to have good performances from the cast. I can say with conviction that Prestige has the most astonishingly powerful performances from all the actors involved and most certainly from its two male leads. Christian Bale does the role of Alfred Borden with at most conviction and ease. It just seems like a walk in the park for him. He is absolutely brilliant in a role with relatively less heroism when compared to his Batman outing with Nolan. Michael Caine once again proves he is the among the best in the business even at this age. He has a very significant role and you can trust Cine to deliver a stunning performance and he does. Scarlett Johanson brings the glamour quotient and doesn't really have much to do-but she does play her part well. But Hugh Jackman steals the show. It is without a shred of doubt the actor's best performance till date.He plays Robert Angier with supreme confidence and elegance and with the charm that is in born him. He is so good that you feel he was born to play Angier! The cinematography,costumes and make-up are brilliant. The movie captures the mood and look of Victorian London brilliantly. Last-but-not-least the direction. No one, not even Tarantino or Spielberg could have done the movie better than Nolan. He has made an absolute spectacular movie which is as close to perfection as you could possibly get! An absolute must for everyone. Go grab the DVD now if you missed it in the theatres!!! BRILLIANT!!!"
" My big question....is...
",,"Which of the brothers died hanged in prison?The problem with The Prestige is that it so clearly lays out its plan to present its tale like the magic trick explained in the opening scene that we start to look immediately for what the Turn will be and what the Prestige will be. We are looking for the gimmick, and we can find it fairly early on. The press materials implore critics not to spoil the film by revealing the ""deceptions at the heart of the film."" But less than halfway through the film many viewers will experience that ""a-ha"" moment when all is clear. It's a moment of smug satisfaction that you have figured out the magician's secret coupled with the sad disappointment that you have not been fooled and now have to sit through the rest of the show with no surprises."
" THE PRESTIGE (Christopher Nolan, 2006) ***1/2
",,"I've been interested in this period drama about the rivalry between a couple of magicians ever since I first heard about it, promising to be the kind of film they don't make 'em like anymore - it was that, and then some! Still, if there's one criticism I'd level at THE PRESTIGE, it's this: magic there is here but no poetry (the closest it comes is in the scene where the snow is 'lit' up and when Hugh Jackman stumbles upon the transported hats); having just rewatched Georges Franju's JUDEX (1963), I felt this most strongly - what it needed, perhaps, was a more evocative score (a' la Maurice Jarre's haunting theme for that film). Likewise, I somewhat regret the fact that the settings and the detail had to be so realistic - but I can see how this was vital to the psychology (which is, basically, what drives the plot in the first place!).The film shows the essential fun of the craft but also the dedication it requires; the throat-cutting which goes on behind the scenes does seem a little far-fetched, even if propelled by a quest for vengeance (to say nothing of the extremity of the sacrifice to which the two men and those closest to them seem to be willing to go, or are made to, merely to feed their individual unhealthy obsession!) - except that the plot is so absorbing it's only after the film is over that one has time to ponder on such details!! Of course, the multiple revelations during its last act are astounding, if not a little confusing and somewhat too clever for their own good (it's ironical, too, that the two magicians end up 'dying' the same way as their respective spouses - but to reveal more would be unthinkable!): it certainly needs more than a single viewing for all the subtleties to be picked up and, while I'm not usually one to allow most recent films another look, this one is utterly fascinating and enjoyable...so I wouldn't have a problem with that (and, in any case, reading the HTF's ""Official Discussion Thread"" on THE PRESTIGE got me thinking about how much of it went over my head!).The casting works better than I had anticipated: both Jackman and Christian Bale are their respective characters and they work off each other beautifully; Michael Caine and David Bowie, then, lend dignity to the proceedings with their knowing and underplayed roles. Still, while the contribution of the three women in their lives (Scarlett Johannson, Rebecca Hall and Piper Perabo) isn't just decorative, only Hall as Bale's long-suffering wife is handed a truly meaty character; in fact, as was the case with THE BLACK DAHLIA (2006), Johannson serves mainly as a device to accentuate the power play being enacted between the two self-destructing male leads - but, then, such high-profile and noteworthy assignments can only increase her own prestige {sic} as an actress...I've loved all of Nolan's films I've watched so far (I'm only left with his debut feature, FOLLOWING [1998], to catch up with) - but I can safely say that this one's the best (or, if you like, my favorite) of the lot."
" The Prestige - promises and delivers
",,"Before going to this movie, you may want to consider reading up on Nikola Tesla and his nearly invisible presence in the history of modern electricity. I'll explain later.Going to this movie I expected magic, love, rivalry and maybe even the supernatural. There was definitely magic, although the movie itself did not feel magical. However, that should not keep you from seeing the movie. There was love, but I did not love this movie as I was watching it. There was rivalry and plenty of it. And ""supernatural""? Well, I still struggle with that because one of the mysteries of the movie has quite an interesting but unresolved history.In my opinion most people are going to see this movie because of the excellent actors and the potential for supernatural thrills. What I fear is that most people who see this movie will not know how to relate Tesla to the ""supernatural"" and magic of electricity. So, for your own good, check out Wikipedia or some other resource for information about Nikola Tesla. If you know the story of Tesla and his experiments, you will find the movie and ending even more satisfying. Remember all through the movie what the three parts of the magic trick are - the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige. Does Michael Caine only refer to the tricks the magicians perform or does he have a deeper message? Does Christopher Nolan have a deeper message? I for one, think he was very clever with the ending.Performances, twists, the ending and direction make this movie well worth the money for the viewer who wants some intelligence out of a movie that promises magic. It can be slow but it gives you time to think(I needed plenty of that).I pledge 8 of 10 canaries."
" Dark tale of magician rivalry takes many twists and turns...
",,"Perhaps there is such a thing as a story taking too many twists and turns, and not all of them credible. That's the major fault of THE PRESTIGE which pits two very ambitious magicians (HUGH JACKMAN and Christian BALE) against each other in a manner that hasn't been seen on the screen since Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine played dirty tricks on each other in SLEUTH.But there are other compensations in THE PRESTIGE to make it a worthwhile viewing experience for the serious movie-goer. It captures the look and feel of Victorian England with its beautifully detailed sets, artfully low-key in lighting but teaming with vitality and authentic looking period decor.Then too, the performances are all at a perfect pitch to make it an ensemble cast of acting pros doing their best to keep you guessing until the final shot. MICHAEL CAINE is wonderful in a colorful supporting role as the man who devises some of the ingenious stunts and SCARLETT JOHANSSON makes the most of a rather brief supporting role as a traitorous magician's assistant. And as the scientist who leaves Jackman with one of his most inspired tricks, David BOWIE is excellent as Tesla.But the last fifteen minutes are shrouded in such mystery and some highly doubtful explanations that the conclusion comes as a bit of a letdown after all the build-up to what the viewer can only hope will be a plausible ending.Christopher Nolan does much better with this than he did with MEMENTO, even though the tricky story structure is again likely to add confusion to all the entertaining twists and turns that occur on a regular basis.But overall, it's a very entertaining and puzzling piece of work with sleight of hand magic at every turn."
" Not terribly mysterious; too many twists
",,"The prestige, we're told, is the third and final part of a magic act, the one in which the twists and turns occur, the denouement of the act. Bet you didn't know that, did you? Apparently magicians analyze and study their craft endlessly, trying to improve, compete, excel, and dominate. The Prestige is about two lifelong competing magicians in 1900s London who are constantly trying to discover each other's secrets. Eventually, as they top each other, there's death, perhaps murder, placing everyone they know in mortal danger.Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) is the showman, the magician with a flair for the dramatic. Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is the moody technician with the creativity and intelligence to pull off the most remarkable stunts. They would seem to be fine complements for each other, but each is so set on beating the other that all pretense of camaraderie is abandoned.What follows, of course, is a couple hours of twists and turns, with so and so turning out to not be what he or she was purported to be. One of Angier's tricks goes horribly awry, and Borden is blamed for the result and is jailed. Is he guilty? How did he accomplish it? Linking the two masters is the aged Cutter (Michael Caine), who's been training them both since they were just starting out. A veteran of the gritty, no-holds-barred magic world, Cutter Knows Things. With a glint in his eye and a crusty grin, he reminded me more of Long John Silver, except without the eye path or the walking stick. Nothing like a crusty ol' sage to keep everyone in check, right? The heart of the animosity between Angier and Borden is that it's thought that Borden somehow was responsible for the death of Angier's wife during their act. Then Borden goes on to fame and fortune while Angier has nothing. Even Borden's tricks kick the ass of Angier's tricks, so much so that the latter journeys to, of all places, Boulder, Colorado in the United States to seek out Nicholas Tesla (well played by David Bowie), who'd built a funky device for Borden to use in his own act. All that's missing is Angier shouting, ""Vengeance will be mine!"" Enter Olivia (Scarlett Johansson), a trollop/assistant who joins Angier's act. They fall in love, surprisingly. (That sentence brought to you by the word ""sarcasm."") Meanwhile, Borden falls in love with HIS assistant and knocks her up. So it's sort of like real life.Perhaps where the movie really lost me is in its science - one must suspend quite a bit of disbelief in order for key parts of the film to be acceptable. That's one of the risks of a story about magic; modern audiences know a lot more about science than did those at the turn of the last century, so there'd be much more skepticism. If Angier's trick were shown today, people would have myriad guesses as to what really happened, whereas in the 1900s it was all magic and wonder and crap like that. Still and all, the way in which Angier accomplishes his trick seems like a shaggy dog - it's in the story merely to move the plot along.I like movies with twists and turns, but when there are so many of them I no longer know what's right and what's wrong, I kind of lost interest in the movie. I hate not knowing which way is up, because when the credibility of each character - and, by extension, their own reality - is called into question, then the viewer has nothing to go by, and truly Anything can happen. Which makes me wonder what the point really is.On the plus side, you have the subtext of Batman (Bale) versus Wolverine (Jackman). Even Alfred from Batman is there (Caine). And both actors are pretty good, but the movie plods along in places. I've never really liked Bale, though, who has a giant head.See The Illusionist instead, a movie covering some of the same ground but more effectively and believably, with scarce, credible turns."
" Oscar Sleeper
",,"Sleeper for Oscar. The suspense keeps adding up throughout to an unbelievably astonishing and satisfying ending. I predict Best Supporting nominations for Michael Cain and Scarlett Johansson. Best Actor nod for Hugh Jackman and Best Picture nomination. I went in at the urging of my wife and was incredibly captivated with this saga. I never knew what ""The Prestige"" meant (or is), but was slowly drawn into it's full meaning through the skillful writing and the expert acting and staging of this period piece of art. Not only skillful acting, writing and staging, but magnificent and sweeping cinematography and a score that, while unnoticed during the movie, came to a crescendo that matched the satisfaction I felt at the end."
" Excellent movie! All the secrets are unveiled, but you would never guess how they are unveiled until you see it!
",spoiler,"This movie was ABSOLUTELY excellent! There was so many twists and turns, you never know what might happen next. The ending was unpredictable and it all comes together with the explanation! SPOILERS: I can't believe the whole thing with Christian Bale's characters! And Hugh Jackman never even dies! How crazy is that? How did he know to keep one of him alive? END SPOILERS I was just really surprised at the entire thing, I wasn't expecting that ending. There are tiny hints throughout the movie as to what will happen, but most people don't catch on. I did catch on a bit to some of them, but I have a better eye then most people, so it's easy to say that the public will probably not catch those hints as well. I'm glad I went to see the first show for myself because then I wouldn't hear the 'hints' to look for and I figured it out on my own. Excellent movie, definitely worth an IMMEDIATE see!"
" Untrue to the novel and really bad taste
",,"Typical Hollywood movie and a complete ruin to the novel true meaning. In few words, what a bunch of emptiness which give you a really bad taste to the people who has read the novel. Yes, good entertainment for all the wrong reasons. I don't know how the original writer let this movie to be out maybe his dark side took over him when the screenplay was shown to him. Ending different to Novel, showing that Hollywood doesn't care about moral values anymore like having more blood in your hands is better. Plus many discrepancies along the movie related to the original novel. I never expected to be similar to the novel because it is just a movie but at least I was expecting to keep similar contest related to the novel. I wouldn't advice watching this movie with your children or family because it will send the wrong signal and set of moral values to the young ones. The novel was more meaningful because it take you to the whole stage of friendship, rivalries, competition, vengeance, repentance, and spiritual awareness. The violent final just show,like this year Oscar that blood and violence pay and let's forget about teaching real values to the kids. Killing is better and vengeance evens more without any self repentance. If we keep rating so well this novel adaptation there won't be novel adaptation but completely new stories claiming to be from from books just to sell better. I wonder if the Lord of the Ring adaptation to the big screen would have been made like this movie, I would not go anymore to cinema to watch new novel adaptations knowing that they just would be a big disappointment. The 3 points I gave was just for acting of the main character because indeed they did a great performance, but that is all"
" any one else confused?
",,"OK the movie was good don't get me wrong but come on now was anyone else as confused as me, i never understood it, it kept changing and the end really threw me off. it might have been better had they made it easier to understand, i mean how did the whole twin thing come up at the end? they both end up having a twin, that was weird. and you never figure out which twins live or die, its to confusing. i think they needed to explain more in the movie then it would have been a lot less confusing, i'm sure i'm not the only one who was confused, please help me out here. were you as confused as me? if anyone understood it please explain. again it wasn't a bad movie it just need to be more understandable."
" Horrible Except For
",,"This has to be the year's worst film. An utter discombobulated mess. The acting hear is so bad it is mind-boggling. Michael Caine turns in perhaps his worst performance as some sort of wizard or something to that effect. Christian Bale is equally putrid in his role as one of the feuding magicians, this film makes absolutely no sense and its shocking failure is augmented pathetically by worst of all, Hugh Jackman. A clearly homosexual man being tormented by his crushing demons, he can't seem to get his mind focused for a second on his role as the second feuding magician. Christopher Nolan once again proves to be one of the worst and gratuitously artsy directors. This film fails miserably as anything but a pure pile of rubbish. Michael Caine has completely tarnished his legacy with another unfocused, unnecessary role. One bright spot is Scarlett Johansson however lifting this film all the way to a 4 from a 1 with her sheer beauty and pure excellence, reaffirming her status as the world's most talented actress."
" Very predictable... the movie that should have had it's own
",,"disappearing act.... totally cheesy. Geesh... The plot was interesting at first but became annoying and petty as the two magicians jealously attacked their so-called ""tricks"". It was as if it was expected for me to become OVERWHELMED with emotion as I learned the true magic behind one of the tricks... hell, the ""magic"" behind this trick was predicted 30 minutes before it was revealed... my friend and I both fidgeted and just wished that the damn movie would just end sans all the needless drama at the end... BTW, how long does it take to die from a gunshot to the abdomen? Whaaaaah... the pain, the misery, the demise of a wicked magician... Blah, blah, blah... the bottom line... boring, predictable, cheesy."
" ....hocus bogus................
",,"I found this movie to be ponderous with a bogus ending, deus ex machina. The redeeming grace is the acting by all which was very good. It was great to see David Bowie, as Tessla, in a film again. His trademark two different eye colors, unobscured by matching contact lenses, add to his character's dimension, and ""Smeegle"" is amusing as Tessla's assistant. The sets and settings were very good, but I'm a sucker for a well put together period piece. The construction of the tricks was interesting and I enjoyed the execution of them throughout the entire film. I don't understand how the viewer rating is so high on this one, it's very long I much preferred ""The Illusionist"", with it's superior pacing and plot line that was much easier to follow and a better payoff at the end."
" I'm So Confused
",,"After watching this movie, I have no idea what just happened."
" Great movie with one glaring error: If the illusion isn't created under real world restrictions, the trick falls apart.
",spoiler,"Magic is the art of making the impossible happen on the stage under the restrictions of what is possible in the real world.
If the illusion isn't considered impossible by the audience, the trick falls apart.
If the illusion isn't created under real world restrictions, the trick also falls apart.An example:
If someone used video editing software to create a magic trick which involved a magician pulling a dragon out of his hat. That wouldn't be considered magic, or at least it would be considered cheating. Why is this? Well, because in video editing software you're able to create your own version of reality, which in this example includes the existence of dragons. Now you are no longer operating under the restrictions of the real world.And that is exactly the GLARING issue with this movie. It extends reality to include actual human cloning through Tesla's devices. And this simply doesn't work as an explanation. If the trick behind the prestige didn't have to be confined to reality why couldn't Angiers just have a time-machine? Why couldn't it be aliens teleporting him to the other side of the theater? Why couldn't he have ridden to the other side of the theater on the back of a magical dragon?All of those explanations are as impossible as human cloning. So if there are no impossibilities, then there is no such thing as magic.Now, I have heard some theories stating that Angiers didn't really clone himself, that that was also trickery. But that doesn't make sense, as at the end of the movie we see him shoot a clone of himself, we see one of his clones die in the tank and that same clone on the operating table and we see a whole array of tanks lined up with dead clones of Angiers. Also Cutter's line about having lied to him that the drowning sailor told him ""he felt like he was going home"" and that he actually told him ""it was agonizing"". Is Cutter making him aware of the suffering he's causing, which can only mean that he is actually drowning people."
" What a mess
",,"So many characters, so many plot twists, so many relationships, so many secrets and tricks... In the end, we are left feeling bored. This film was clearly designed as an allegory of a magic trick, but it lacks the punch line, or the so-called 'prestige'.
It is never quite clear who is in love with whom in this film, who is angry at whom and why, or why the characters do what they do. Are they just fanatical competitors, or is it all about revenge for what they did in private? You see, it is impossible to grasp the motivation of these characters, because frankly, most of the time their actions are either extremely childish or outright psychotic. Yet the characters are not portrayed as such, so when they act the way they act, one is not quite sure what they are doing.
Also, the script is not only needlessly convoluted, but it is also too lazy for a film that is all about clever tricks. These magicians go to such extreme lengths to fool others, yet the script makes them look dumb whenever it is convenient for the screenwriter. How can these masters of magic manage to never recognize one another, just because they are wearing a fake beard? How come they are fooled by a fake belly and a fake nose? How come they never anticipate the other might try and sabotage their act, and take necessary precautions? There are so many moments where these otherwise super cunning characters act like complete idiots. And that ruins the fun. But what really ruins it for me is that the ending reveals absolutely nothing of any interest, other than things everyone in the audience already knew at that point. Why were these two sabotaging and outdoing each other like this? Guess they were crazy after all. But that is not a satisfying ending."
" Let's make magicians hate each other
",spoiler,"The movie's plot is about rival magicians ruining each other's lives. Because the director does a poor job with character development (humanizing them, an art Spielberg is the master of) I am left to not care about them personally nor their fates. When we paused the movie almost halfway thru our comment was ""so the movie is basically going to be a pissing match between two magicians. Got it.""Character development was sacrificed in order to fit in 5,000 twists and turns to get us to our climax in the end. The plot is too convoluted with science fiction and double-crossing.You could have removed Tesla's replicating machine from the movie, focused more on the commitment to create doubles or other less forms of ""mad science"" and spent more time developing the characters so that feelings like rage, jealousy and revenge would actually make sense to the audience. Jackman's wife dies but we don't feel his pain. We're just shown he's in pain (yet he's sleeping with Scarlet Johansson in no time). If his pain is not truly felt, how can I understand a burning psychotic obsession to ruin another man's life at all costs?The acting was very good so I give it a 4/10."
" Pay close attention
",,"The Prestige is a mind-bender. Even if you've seen this movie before, you still have to pay close attention each time you watch it. It's a dark, tragic and cautionary tale with engaging performances from the whole cast. Christopher Nolan knows how to tell a story."
" I feel cheated
",spoiler,"This is a complete mess of a movie.
Not only it does not follow the plot of the book it is based on, it violates all principles of what should be ethical when generating a plot for a movie.The mix of historic figures like Tesla and science fiction can NEVER be an acceptable resource, except for comedy or class C Sci-fi movies.But not only it mixes ""real"" magic with science fiction in order to ""explain"" the plot, even with the science fiction component the plot does not make sense. A few things that should have happened for the plot to be plausible:Tesla should be not only a genius, but also really dumb to sell (or give away?) a machine capable of teletransportation. cloning and/or duplicating objects that could make him millionaire just replicating gold.Bales's character wife should be really dumb not to realize she was dealing with two brothers for YEARSAngier had to test and calibrate the machine. That would have created SEVERAL clones of himself that were not immediately killed and had to be killed later and their bodies disposed. Quite unlikely they would accept that destiny easily.If Angier was making 100 shows, he would have 100 bodies to dispose....which were never discovered before the final shown and neither after it, when police would have investigated.It would require the machine to create not just a duplicate, but a person with all memories and same twisted thinking process as the original body.Why would Bale's character send Angier to see Tesla, instead of ANYWHERE else? If the argument is because he KNEW Tesla was working on cloning or tele transportations so it would be credible, why wouldn't he suspect that was the trick when Angier came back with an improved trick?Why is it that the two persons that drown die instantly and no attempt of resuscitation is made? They both could have survived and be revived, even with the limited knowledge of the time. The glass was broken just a few seconds after both lost consciousness. There have been people revived in REAL events after 40 MINUTES of immersion in water, and certainly it would be possible just a few seconds afterwards.I watched the movie with interest, although it was confusing at times, it is clear that a lot of money, resources and acting power was used. But after it ended I felt cheated, the plot kills it.It is not science fiction, it is not drama, it is not romance, it is a NOTHING. Waste of time."
" Nolan's first misstep? Maybe.
",,"This film is too smart, or perhaps the word should be convoluted, for its own good. Nolan has crafted a movie about obsession and revenge under the guise of magic but the execution stalls in many areas. Watching The Prestige is like observing a magic act where the magician's sleight-of-hand isn't deft enough. The trick almost works, but not quite... With its mechanical twists and turns and lack of heart, the movie often resembles Sleuth in superficial ways, except The Prestige resorts to cheating while Sleuth relied on cunning and guile. As is too often the case with narratives that try to be oblique to the end, the film's climax is strangely predictable. The Prestige goes to a great deal of trouble - including a triple time-line - to protect secrets that aren't all that surprising or hard to guess. The acting by the leads- Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale is top notch but that should be a given."
" Didn't Enjoy It As Much As I'd Hoped
",,"Don't get me wrong, the movie is amazing, it's well directed, the scenes are flawless, the magic is incredible, but it was far from what I had expected which is what perhaps left me filled with negative affections towards the film.After watching Dunkirk and Inception by the same, amazing director of The Prestige- Christopher Nolan- I expected something brilliantly made, and it is. It is fantastically made and the movie looks amazing.The issues with the film I have, lie within the characters. I didn't feel as though there was much growth in these characters. Angier and Borden both seem the exact same at the beginning of the film towards the end.I like Angier at the start of the film, not like Borden as much, and ended the movie not liking either of them. The only character I really cared about was the character played by Scarlett Johansson who's character name I don't really care to remember.I just felt like neither of the two main leads developed or changed. Angier was bitter from beginning to end, and Borden just grew to become bitter and I can't stand the fact that they do have any redeeming qualities in my eyes.The movie was enjoyable other than this, and I will continue to watch Christopher Nolan's films in the future, as he is talented. However, so hope his future films involve more character growth and have qualities that make them likeable that aren't outweighed by bad qualities."
" Best Film Ever
",,Not exaggerating. This is the greatest film I have ever seen.
" Watch It Closely!
",,"This movie is really mesmerizing. At the beginning, I was confused with the plot presented. The story is very heavy and very riveting. Care must be taken of impressions for impressions. One of the best magicians. You will get carried away how dark the world of magicians competing in the real world. Risking your life for a magic trick. I ran out of words with this kind of storyline. Plus the selection of a good cast and director Christopher Nolan is undoubtedly his work in the world of film. You will not be able to predict how this movie will end. Very high class."
" Interesting story
",,"The Prestige is a 2006 British-American mystery thriller film directed by Christopher Nolan, from a screenplay adapted by Nolan and his brother Jonathan from Christopher Priest's 1995 novel of the same name. Its story follows Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, rival stage magicians in London at the end of the 19th century. Obsessed with creating the best stage illusion, they engage in competitive one-upmanship with tragic results. The film stars Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, Christian Bale as Alfred Borden, and David Bowie as Nikola Tesla. It also stars Michael Caine, Scarlett Johansson, Piper Perabo, Andy Serkis, and Rebecca Hall. The film reunites Nolan with actors Bale and Caine from Batman Begins and returning cinematographer Wally Pfister, production designer Nathan Crowley, film score composer David Julyan, and editor Lee Smith.The film was released on October 20, 2006, receiving positive reviews and strong box office results, and received Academy Award nominations for Best Cinematography and Best Art Direction. Along with The Illusionist and Scoop, The Prestige was one of three films released in 2006 to explore the world of stage magicians."

Just love the way the movie is setup in the early 1900's, whilst visiting some of the legends of the time (Nikola Tesla) and the element of magic only adds more flavor to the already magnificent ride through Nolan's eyes. Bale and Jackman deliver performances worth delivering.DO NOT MISS THIS! at ANY cost!"

" Amazing!
",spoiler,"The Prestige made me constantly wondering about what was going to happen next. I did not see the twists at the end coming and, thinking over the movie afterwards, I can see how they foreshadowed them. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were brilliant as the friends-turned-enemies magicians!The rest of the cast - Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine, Andy Serkis, David Bowie...they were all amazing. Honestly, I can't think why they cast an American(Scarlett Johansson) as a Brit, but I can look past that.All in all, a fantastic film! I highly recommend!"
" Wonderful
",,"This is absolutely one of the best movies ever seen.I don't know why it's still so ""unkown"", compared to many other movies of the same level, or less.Here you can find the right mix of suspense, surprise and a marvelous plot with a touch of Sci-Fi, that doesn't impact the reality of the scenario. Wonderful the final, one of those you keep in memory for a long time. Impossible to forget!Adding two actors like Hugh Jackman and Christopher Nolan (both of them in one of their best interpretations), it's difficult not to give the maximum vote: 10!"
" Imperfect but fascinating
",,"As said in my review for his masterpiece 'Memento', Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'The Prestige' is not quite perfect, but is still very good and one of Nolan's better films. To me actually it was close to outstanding, which makes my issues with the denouement even more frustrating. And it is the denouement that's 'The Prestige's' biggest problem, being over-baked and with one twist too many, the second of which being a convoluted cop-out and like the other twists before the denouement didn't happen.Was also, to a lesser extent, expecting more from David Julyan's music score, having done such a great job with the score for 'Memento'. His score for 'The Prestige' works within the film and has a mystical and dread quality, but it is not one of those scores that is listenable or even re-listenable as music on its own, lacking the cleverness and mood and thematic complexities of his work for 'Memento' and being somewhat too simplistic to be entirely memorable.However, 'The Prestige' looks wonderful. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious, complete with gorgeously evocative Victorian period production and costume design. Once again, Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and while the film is long there is enough to keep one riveted.The story for 'The Prestige' is quite the fascinating tale, with an incredible period and darkly magical atmosphere and twists and turns peppered throughout but done in a way that the storytelling is coherent and taken with sincere seriousness while not coming across as emotionally cold.Fine acting all round, with a charmingly flamboyant Hugh Jackman and intensely charismatic Christian Bale perfectly cast and playing off against other wonderfully. Michael Caine brings class and dignity to his role, and seeing how he altered his voice and posture for it it was clear he was right in the zone. Rebecca Hall, Piper Perabo and Scarlett Johansson also do well, as does surprisingly David Bowie in an unlikely role. Andy Serkis is similarly memorable.Overall, imperfect film but also a fascinating one, flaws and all it is for me one of Nolan's better films. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
" Magic is from long-term preparation
",,"Sacrifice, that's the price of a good trick. Actually, from the very beginning, the screen script has all told us how the two trick were played. Change the cage and bird into the box and magician, then there comes the answer. I am shocked by the skills used by Nolan, a genius director. Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts. The first part is called ""the pledge."" The magician shows you something ordinary. The second act is called ""the turn."" The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it into something extraordinary. But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear isn't enough. You have to bring it back. This movie also taught me that if I want to do something very hard, I must have my own way and prepare for it for a long time which is also seen in the movie ""Now You See Me."""
" Wonderful movie; one of the best I've seen in a while
",spoiler,"*I Will try not to use spoilers but will notify prior if I deem necessary for the reviewOverall: This movie is, simply put, a work of art. Not perfect by any means but honestly this movie is excellent. Nolan hasn't failed me yet!Good: The cinematography was phenomenal. The music was very well done and excellently crafted. All the acting from Hugh Jackman to Christian Bale to even Michael Caine, whom I was pleasantly surprised to see here, was incredible. The story itself is excellent with an incredible ending. Very well drawn and developed characters who each have their own motives and personas which drive them. The actual magic tricks themselves, while fake, where awesome and just were cool to witness.Bad: The first act is a tad confusing and easily its weakest. Christian Bale's accent can get a tad annoying from time to time but that is a minor gripe.Best Part: The EndingMVP: Christian Bale as Alfred Borden10/10"

" well worth watching
",,"The supreme casting, the set, props and costumes all make this into a great movie. I was drawn in and left in suspense, and amongst the tricks there are some left unexplained. I love that. The Prestige isabout revenge and rivalry, and it aims to trick both the theater audience in the film, and You! But even though I could see through the plot, it never bored me. The characters are complicated, and you never really know who to root for. The main characters, played by Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, are both cynical, but you feel empathy for both of them. Scarlett Johansson, Micheal Caine and Rebecca Hall also do their roles very well. Well worth watching,"
" An Incredible and Magical Experience
",,"The first time I watched Christopher Nolans ""The Prestige"" I didn't really know what to think I watched it in the wrong circumstances, I was on a plane and couldn't really take it in properly, so my first advice when watching this film is make sure that your watching it so that you can pay attention because if you love a good and mind bending mystery then you will love this movie just as much as I did because The Prestige is one of my all time favourite movies. The initial rivalry and physiological warfare that goes on between Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman is a really effective plot device because you know how much it means to both of them to be the best there motivations are very understandable and the tole that it takes on them is truly intriguing to watch unfold. I adored watching the mechanics of the magic tricks it makes you realise how simple it is while never ruining the magic for you. The setting of 19th century is just a marvel to watch the production design is seamless and you can clearly tell that a lot off effort went in to it. To date I think this is Hugh Jackman finest performance it really showed his acting range from a happy yet naive magician to a haunting and damaged character. Christian Bale is also really good in this film he feels natural and it's truly disturbing to watch his life fall apart in conjunction with Hugh Jackman's. Scarlett Johansson also gives the greatest performance of her career in this film she's perfect at portraying the one thing these two characters still have in common. David Bowie was fantastic in this movie he's really mysterious yet somewhat wise and or definitely one of the best performances ever given by a musician. Christopher Nolan directed this movie beautifully everything from the editing, to the stage illusions to the little moments that set up for the final twist are all done perfectly and it do date amazes me The the academy continue to snub him. The final twist in the movie is just perfect it feels believable thanks to Nolans direction but is anything but predictable. The Prestige is a masterpiece I have not one flaw with this movie it's got amazing performances, direction and locations it's one of my favourite Nolan movies by far. A+/100%"
" Awesome Movie
",spoiler,"Awesome movie , because I get from this movie is just watch yourself that what you can do or what's your strength, if you compare yourself to other so you definitely get something that you can't do and whenever you find that you went so far to get that or i say at any cost you have to pay , you are going to pay and it can be dangerous for you and also for your family , so just know yourself that what you can do ......Movie is about that , Robert Angier was crossed all limits to destroy the legacy of Alfred Borden no doubt , because of Borden Angier lost his wife .After that Angier want revenge and he took his way , then he knew that Borden has a new trick so to know that trick Angier went to far and at the end he have to pay his life."

A disguised Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) sneaks under the stage. At the trick's culmination, Angier drops through a trap door and into a waiting water tank, where Borden watches him drown.At Borden's murder trial, Angier's ingénieur, John Cutter, testifies that he believes Borden pushed the water tank under the trap door to catch and kill Angier during his Transported Man trick. In prison, Borden is visited by an agent of Lord Caldlow, who offers to care for Borden's daughter Jess in exchange for all of Borden's secrets. As a show of good faith, Caldlow gives Borden a copy of Angier's diary, which he begins reading.In flashback, Angier and Borden work as shills for ""Milton the Magician,"" alongside John Cutter (Michael Caine) then Milton's ingénieur, and Julia (Piper Perabo), Milton's assistant and Angier's wife. Milton's famous trick is the water tank trick, where Julia is bound in ropes and dropped in a water tank, from which she frees herself and escapes. Borden, with Julia's consent, ties her hands with a more secure, yet difficult knot. Julia fails to slip the knot and drowns, infuriating Angier and fueling his deep-seated grudge against Borden."

" Justifies the genre. Mystery, Thriller, Drama!!!
",,"The title never gives an idea about the movie (unless you are a magician or magic fan). The star-cast DOES INCLUDE a lot of STARS. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and so on.. Movie depicts two competitions. The most part is the competition of two stage magicians trying to defeat each other. On the other hand, the competition between two iconic scientists (Thomas Edison and Nikola Tesla) is shown as well (not much of it though). I wont tell much about the story but one thing is for sure, when you are going to watch this movie (for the 1st time of course) then do keep your heart-rate under control (Mandatory stuff). Christopher Nolan showed his class. Entire crew did great and the movie turns out to justify it's category of being MYSTERY, THRILLER, DRAMA! (Also Twister from my side). 10/10 movie.. Cant say whether it's a one time watch or more but surely this movie deserves a lot of appreciation (that it got).."
" Masterful deceit
",,"I remember vividly going to see ""The Prestige"" upon release - the mesmerizing twists, the movie almost folding in on itself - but it becomes more apparent on further viewings just how well constructed this movie really is. The rivalry between these two fanatics goes to some scary lengths; and even though I usually gravitate towards Hugh Jackman in this story, it's evident that Christian Bale is the more obsessive in his stagecraft (which might just be the difference in the two characters rather than the actors). I love the unfurling of this story and its Victorian setting, and it's still one of my favorite Nolan movies. But the real cherry on top, the real thrill is when (and how) they inject Nikola Tesla into the proceedings. It says a lot (negatively) that this is the most we've seen of this man in the past ten years, and he truly does need more exposure. But either way, as soon as he enters the picture, it's like ""BOOM!"" the movie enters a whole new strata. And Bowie's an inspired choice for the role.Killer movie.8/10"
" Christopher Nolan does a good job!
",,"THE PRESTIGE is one of Christopher Nolan's most underrated films. When people think of his movies, they always think of movies such as Memento, Inception and The Dark Knight Rises (both Inception and The Dark Knight Rises has been reviewed on IMDb).I might not like the story of the film, but I love the direction of Christopher Nolan and this movie is awesometacular in every way. First off, the acting is great. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Scarlett Johannson, David Bowie and Michael Caine all did really great jobs in this film and I could have not been more pleased.The music, cinematography and visual style are also gorgeous and the direction is perfect. The movie is also the prime example of keeping you in your seat in theaters or watching this on DVD or TV, it is a true blessing.Overall, I don't like the story of this movie, but I can still watch THE PRESTIGE and this movie is close to being a smash hit. So, I will give this film an 8 out of 10."
" Underrated and Should Not Be Missed!
",,"Christopher Nolan's The Prestige is one of those movies that I think has gotten overlooked, and may have been looked at negatively because of it. I think that this is one of the best movies that I have seen for several reasons, and I think that everyone should give it a try. I will focus on two things about the movie: what makes the plot so compelling and the casting of the movie.The Prestige is about two magicians, Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), who become rivals to one another. They begin working together as friends, but a terrible event tears them apart for the rest of their lives. The story consists of exciting plot twists, revenge, sabotage, and an end reveal that will keep you thinking about it for a while after it's over. The story really excels at spending its duration leading up to the climax while keeping you interested and thinking. In a world where Hollywood is dominated by action blockbusters, this movie stands out by asking you to think. In a way, the movie kind of gives you an active role because you will be trying to figure out what will happen throughout the film. This movie has added value in that it should be watched more than once for you to fully understand the ending. There are many times throughout the movie that Nolan hints at the ending that you will think nothing of until you know how the movie ends and watch it again.Christopher Nolan also did a good job in the casting for this movie. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman were perfect for the two main roles. They really gave you the sense that they were once friends, but now only had the goal of destroying the other's life and work. They were surrounded by many other good actors and actresses like Scarlett Johansson, Rebecca Hall, Michael Caine, and Andy Serkis who all provide great performances. Overall the casting choices really fit well together, and they made the movie flow very well. Everyone felt very well fit for the roles that they were given.So to finish off, I think that this movie is underrated because maybe it is hard to understand or it is not an action blockbuster, but I think that it provides lots of entertainment and worthwhile content. The benefits of re-watching it is another reason that I think that everyone should check this one out. Anyone who like movies that make you think even after they are over, and provide an incentive to watch them again will not be disappointed with the prestige."
" One of the best movies ever
",,"""The Prestige"" is a thrilling and entertaining movie until the last second. It is full of unexpected turns and sudden twist, which lead the spectators to stay in their seats. I liked to watch this movie a lot, because most of it was very realistic. I just did not like the part with ""the transported man"" and this whole science stuff. For me the movie gets better the more you think about it afterwards. You recognize a lot, when you watch the movie again, but I won't spoiler now, because you are maybe going to watch it. In my eyes it makes up the beauty of the film, that there is no villain or ""good guy"" the audience wants to survive. To conclude, the actors were brilliant, the story was great and absolutely everybody loved the film."
" Competent but not stellar. Or interstellar.
",,"Professional rivalries between magicians in Victorian London: fun subject matter? Well, its quite melancholy in Christopher Nolan's hands. Its let down a bit by the casting of Hugh Jackman; he's just somehow miscast as a Victorian magician.Its a hard film to love. Everyone is just a little too spiky and distant, there's not a single character you engage with. It feels more like a technical exercise than an engaging story. Its just a little too conventional in its Love-Triangle style construction. I like it better than Now You See Me for example, but less than other Nolan pictures like Inception and Interstellar. I didn't love The Prestige in 2006 and I still don't love it in 2015; funny how some things don't change.7/10"
" Tremendous story telling. Wondrous film.
",,"I knew nothing of this before seeing it and it was such a surprise. I loved it. Not like a modern day film, just a wonderful story. Cast well, acted well. But it is the complex story, the wonder of the magic, and the wonderfully flawed and tragic characters that carries the film to such heights. The complexity of their mistake riddled and shared history defines their relationships and their lives and is so well imagined and so well told on screen. I love Michael Caine's role and his applied example of Ockham's Razor. I've since read criticisms that relate to the depiction of Tesla's or Nolan as a director. Such criticisms have nothing to do with the entertainment value of this film in its own right. I thoroughly enjoyed this and will watch it again. It is a new favourite. If you have not seen this, avoid reviews beforehand and enjoy the surprises throughout."
" amazing
",,"in the beginning, i was thinking: this movie is totally overrated. its not even that interesting. but it captures the true nature of what movies were supposed to be in the first place. most movies today have an intense, climactic ending, while this movie just keeps picking up speed, becoming more interesting as the plot delves deeper and darker and even though one can't seem to grapple which character they support, you'll love this movie and its mind blowing ending. some people say its hard to understand. its really not. if you just pay attention, then you will completely understand it, even though the various jumping around between the years will be confusing. the plot of this requires geniuses at the same level as those of the dark knight. i only have one grievance: if they made this movie today it would've been slightly better because i feel that both hugh jackman and scarlett johansson's acting has developed and become a lot better over the last nine years. also, its not the type of movie you can watch again soon. if you wait a couple years then you'll feel the hype again."
" Nolan Weaves Magic - Abracadabra!
",,"""Are you watching closely?"" Just as magicians use this gibe on their audience, the makers here keep constantly nudging its audience throughout this tricky thriller. The Prestige is a carefully crafted story of trickery and deception of two rival magicians in Victorian England, directed by the greatest magician of them all: Christopher Nolan. It is a taut, exciting portrait of obsession and the dark competitive spirit of professional magicians. Set in a world of top hats, cravats and disappearing bunnies, The Prestige tells the tale of Alfred Bowden (Bale) and Robert Angier (Jackman), who start out as fledgling magician apprentices. They get locked in a bitter feud after the death of an assistant in an illusion gone wrong and subsequently go in search of the ultimate trick. As their quest to become the greatest magician becomes resilient, the counter maneuvers escalate and elevate each man to greater achievement in their desire to be the best. Just when it seems clear that Borden's obsession could only be satisfied by Angier's death, the film turns in on itself again, and we're left searching the stage for clues, grow even more anxious for the big prestige. Soon, flashbacks switch to flash forwards, and quickly we're entangled in a murky conundrum. But that's all I will say. You wouldn't want me to spoil the prestige for you now!Nolan keeps the mood eerie and unsettling, and with all its Gothic trimmings The Prestige comes to feel like a slow-burn horror movie. There are nifty tricks galore up the sumptuous sleeve of this mystifying and wildly entertaining thriller, about obsession, secrets and lies. As is his want, Nolan jumps between time periods and voice-overs with reckless abandon. The movie's real trick is that it all somehow manages to congeal. You know all along you're being misdirected by cinematic sleight of hand, but you can't avoid being sucked in and that is Nolan's greatest triumph. Of course, he is ably buoyed by a pair of carefully complex performances from his superb lead cast who weave the film's heftier ideas seamlessly into the breathable fabric of a great thriller.Nolan has been exploring the dual nature of man throughout his extraordinary career. With The Prestige though, Nolan takes this aspect to new realms. He directs the film exactly like a great trick, so you want to see it again the second it's over. You will leave the cinema posed with the exact same question ""Was I watching closely?"""
" amazing
",,"It was amazing two hours , i watch this movie again and again without getting bored ..I like the scenario, i like actors performance it was amazing. Christian bale and huge Jackman what an amazing couple. scarlet Johanson performance was very good tooanyway it was a perfect movie in all ways. i advice you to watch it. the Illusunist movie was smiler with The Prestige movie. but i like Prestige movie more because it was talking about a fighting between two friend. and i like the avenge scenes. watch the movie NOW or you will left behind you an amazing moments"
" I always Use this Film for an Example of A Perfect Movie (Maybe Minor Spoiler)
",,"Some reasons why:1. The layer of the story ~ Watching the movie is like climbing up the stairs. The story goes step by step in climatic way. It's very interesting to watch and intriguing to wait what will happen next.2. The development of the character ~ The most interesting part of the movie. This is the story about magicians Robert Angier and Alfred Borden that once were friends, and because of one fateful event, they became rivals and obsessed to beat and destroy each other. At first, maybe audience (in this case myself) will feel sympathy for Angeir's character, because he was the victim, and Borden was the villain that caused the death of Angier's wife. But as the story goes, and the characters develop, I don't root on him again, he showed more obsession than just revenge for his wife, his all motivation was just to beat Borden in whatever he did. And so is Borden. They both are flawed. I love how the rivalry goes darker and darker into their obsession. I change my support for the character many times, as they seem to top each other so many many times. But then i realized they're just perfectly equal. Just like Olivia said to Borden as she left him, just like the other people that just can't keep up their obsessive rivalry: ""you deserve each other""3. The plot ~ The movie starts with ""near ending"" scene, and then goes backward from the start to the ""near ending"" point at the beginning, and reveals the final twist in the end. Before that, the audiences may have guessed so many conclusions before knowing the real twists are. Yes, there are twist after twist! I love how it surprises me so many time. Excellent!4. The casts ~ Christian Bale vs Hugh Jackman. And they're just a perfect match on this. All the rest of the casts also brilliantly played. The visual is beautiful and this is a well made movie.5. The tragic message and shocking end ~ At the beginning of the movie, Angier and Borden reveal the secret the Chinese magician. How he sacrifices his whole life pretending to be frail in public to hide the goldfish bowl beneath his legs just to able to perform his magic trick.This is like a teaser to the whole story. How far one can sacrifice for his obsession, his magic, for the prestige! The point of this movie is a great sacrifice. In the end, when they both confess each other's secret, i was contemplating when the movie ended. How far one can go for their obsession. It's quite disturbing to think about what they have done to their own life. It's the movie that will make you think after watching.Seriously, if you still haven't watched it, you have to give it a try!PS: Don't root to one character, some people I know hate this movie because the character they root for is lost in the end. Well, just like i said they're both flawed and lost great time in the end. Be objective and you can see this is a great masterpiece and the ending is just equal and fair."
" Of all of Christopher Nolan's amazing works, this is definitely my favorite.
",,"I won't spoil much about this movie, it's a film that has to be seen to be believed.Christopher Nolan is big in Hollywood right now. The Dark Knight Trilogy and Inception have all turned him into one of the most successful directors today. Not to mention the initial boost he got from Following and Memento.But of all his work, this is simply the darkest and the most well-made. The entire movie plays out like a magic trick.This is my favorite Christopher Nolan, it's beat his Batman movies, Inception and Memento to it. Watch this right now. You won't regret it. Just remember to use your head and think, it's a movie as cerebral as Inception."
" A true masterpiece
",,"A psychologically thriller plot, a subtle sci-fi background, a twisted romantic story that doesn't eclipse the main one and a jaw-dropping ending are the recipe of this true masterpiece. I think that while Memento is the expression of Nolan talent behind a camera,this is Nolan best screenplay and book adaptation. Nolan brothers have done something astonishing in terms of plot: they did the best work that can be done! Everything is in the right place, at the right time, confusing and hypnotizing you until you are completely caught in a spiral of violence and love, reason and magic. These two sides of a magician show are wonderfully interpreted by an amazing Bale and a surprisingly good Jackman! I recommend this film to all the people who love to be tricked, charmed and amazed by a movie, because this is The Prestige: only something that seems so normal and trivial that can surprise you like no other can."
" The Mesmerising Mr. Nolan Works His Magic
",,"The Prestige is another masterful directorial outing for Christopher Nolan who has not put a foot wrong yet. The film is sandwiched between Batman Begins and The Dark Knight, and serves to once again highlight the wonderful diversity of his work. That he was overlooked for a directorial Oscar nomination for 'Inception' is to the eternal shame of the Academy. The rivalry between Jackman and Bale's characters is loaded with intrigue at every mesmerising twist and turn, and they are supported by a superb cast of characters each presented with an engaging part that the audience cannot fail to invest in. But it is the story that is the true star, brought to life by Nolan, but beautifully imagined by author Christopher Priest. The tricks are all explained but will enthral you nonetheless, as will this excellent film."
" A Great Movie
",,"This movie is excellent! It's one of those I'm always in the mood for!!! I love that it has romance, mystery, suspense, & intrigue! I'm always a big Hugh Jackman fan but I'd have to say this is one of his best! Such great emotion in this movie... And David Bowie?!? Amazing!!! I loved him in this movie! And of course Sir Michael Cane... Exceptionally well as ever! I'm not a huge fan of Scarlett Johansson but I even thought she did pretty great in this movie! I think it's neat that Christian Bale plays in this and Batman as does Sir Michael Cane. Excellent Movie all around!!! I definitely recommend this movie... It is in my personal library!"
" Bereincie
",spoiler,"Personally The Prestige is such a great movie, not only because great actors such as Michael Caine (Batman), Hugh Jackman( X-Man,Christian Bale (Batman), and David Bowie are seen throughout the movie, but because the plot line is complicated and involve three different story lines. The movie is not just about magic, it is also about lies, loyalties, revenge, obsession, love, and the tricks behind the magic. The celerity of each scene in this movie are just amazing because you get the jest of what is happening but leaves you wondering.at the end of The Prestige, when you think that a character has just discomfits his enemy then (bam) plot twist then your left wondering what just happened and you have to- almost need to re-watch this phenomenal movie"
" The Final Line of the Movie
",,"I'm not going to add one more redundant review to the thousands already here, but I do feel the need to make some points about the last line in the movie (without spoilers and without revealing the secret or making it easy).Note that I am not talking about the double twist ending that explains everything - I am talking about the final line that seems to add one more point after the twists are done.Nolan is a very logical writer and makes every detail in his movies fit together like a puzzle. He even made dreams into something very mechanical in Inception. He always plays it straight and gives the audience plenty of clues, allowing us to catch on to everything as long as we focus and use our brains.So the last line in this movie puzzled me because it seemed to just be an ambiguous tease whereas everything before then was made very clear, and this doesn't fit in with Nolan's style.In addition, the sci-fi elements in this movie bothered me. They didn't fit either. But the final line in the movie turns these into something else in a brilliant way.There is a very definite and obvious solution to all this, and the final line is very clear once you understand what it is saying and figure out its secret. But don't forget that the secrets of magic are 'disappointingly simple' once you figure them out.I will not spell it out for you because that would be wrong, but I will give you one clue: Think about the words, and then think about who he is saying it to.Another clue is the speech given by Angier at the end about the reason he does magic for the audience. This speech also seems out of place unless you realize he is saying it for someone else involved in the movie.I thought the movie rated 7-8 until the last line of the movie clicked into place. Then it became a ten."
" An Epic Film
",spoiler,"The Prestige is an impeccable film. The different interweaving plot- lines for each character turned out to be a mental work- out for the audience to understand such events. Almost every character produced a stunning performance; however, I admit that Scarlett Johansson may have only been cast for a pretty face. Although Scarlett fell short in her role as Olivia Wenscombe, I had hardly noticed because of the other actor's amazing work in the film.There are many themes portrayed within this film. The themes that stood out the most to me were rivalry and obsession. In most cases, the rivalries only occurred because of the character's obsessions. This arcane film may not appeal to all audiences; however, after hearing others opinions I believe that the majority enjoyed it. I found that the audience members that did not enjoy the film at all simply did not understand it.This film amazes me because of the actor's abilities to become so many different characters. Once you know the secret of the film you begin to be able to differentiate the hidden characters. I have now watched this film 3 times and each time I am finding new things that I had not noticed before. I can never get tired of this movie because if you truly watch closely you are able to discover new events and details that may have been overlooked.I found it interesting that throughout the film they had emphasized that you have to keep your secret because ""the secret amazes no one"" except in the end of the film Christopher Nolan did not take his own advice. Even though he gave the audience the secret the film was confusing enough that I still had to take a moment to address the events to see if I truly understood it. I do not enjoy when a film allows the audience to predict their own ending for a movie. Even though it is sometimes nice to let your mind wander while making your own ending I prefer to have a definite ending that is given to me. You must watch The Prestige (at least once) or you will be missing out on a truly amazing film."
" best movie I've ever seen
",spoiler,"Not 100% sure if anything I've written qualifies as a spoiler, but I tagged it anyways just in case. It's about 2 rival stage magicians at the end of the 19th century, and follows through years of their lives as the rivalry escalates to dirtier and dirtier levels, but somehow manages to seem neither rushed or dragged out. At it's heart it is an engrossing psychological thriller with no real protagonist. While the movie follows the perspective of Hugh Jackman's character, he's just as much of an antagonist as Christian Bale.The movie keeps you looking for clues to the twist, making it very clear that there's one in the works, but misdirects you into thinking one thing, and then spins it around in a completely different direction. The twists themselves are mind blowing without being stupid, and everything makes perfect sense by the end.The period setting is meticulously well done, even with the inclusion of fantastical science fiction elements provided courtesy of quite possibly the best portrayal of Nichola Tesla in film history, (though granted there haven't been many); nothing ever seems out of place.I saw this movie in the theater, and I remember saying as I walked out, ""that is quite possibly the best movie ever made,"" and I haven't seen anything since that has made me feel that way."
" Maximus,the gladiator lives and defends.
",spoiler,"Ridley Scott's ""Gladiator"" which was published in the year 2000,is the kind of movie upon which Hollywood once built its reputation but rarely produces anymore.It contained gorgeous scenery,impressive set design,and an epic storyline. Russell Crowe is Maximus, a popular general in the emperor Marcus Aurelius's army, who begins the film by winning a great and bloody battle against the Deutch hordes thus securing the roman borders. We learn from this victory that his troops love him, as does the aging emperor (Richard Harris), who asks Maximus to take over in Rome and root out the mercenaries who are corrupting the place. But the emperor already has a son, Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix), who is a self-indulgent, cowardly layabout, with hints of an incestuous relationship with his sister. After that, Commodus, learning of the emperor's decision to name Maximus and not him as the next ruler, kills his father and orders Maximus killed. But because the movie still has another two hours to run, the killers are foiled and Maximus survives."
" My favorite movie
",spoiler,"I rarely give any movie a 10 out of 10, but this one deserves it. This movie has everything that makes a movie great in my eyes. the acting is fabulous, the camera work is great. The overall theme and feel to the movie fits the story in a good fashion. and the story.. just wow. I really like stories with different time lines and the prestige implements this greatly. the different story lines are very subtle and some only occurred to me in the second time I watched this movie. the second time this movie was even better than the first time.spoilers: The only downside I can think of this movie is that halfway through something unnatural or impossible occurs. I think this will be a let down for some people because the rest of the magic tricks are all possible and the methods are shown in the movie. for me this was no problem."
" Oh, that ending...
",,"I will begin this review by stating that the ending really carried the film. If they had done the ending any different or had excluded it altogether, the film would have been entertaining, but not much else.The movie was visually thrilling with the special effects and the acting was superb. I don't think there was anyone in the cast I truly didn't like watching. The plot twists, particularly in the last five minutes, were just...OUTSTANDING. There are few words to describe just how well this movie is and they're all alluding me.The questions this movie brings to mind are conversational pieces long after the credits have rolled. I didn't fall asleep until a few hours after the end of the film. It was fantastic to watch and has definitely made it into my top 10."
" Interpretation of This Film -- *SPOILERS*
",spoiler,"They weren't twin brothers. The Professor knew *exactly* the secret word to tell how to go get a copy of yourself made: ""TESLA"".(1) This film is meant to illuminate the genius of overlooked scientist Nikola Tesla. The film does its best to present us with an extraordinary historical figure whose legacy, in terms of posterity's historical recollections, is less than extraordinary. Tesla cannot be relegated to a mere side-show figure for this film or for its interpretation. A fictitious figure could easily have taken the character-role.(2) The film seeks to illuminate possible humanist qualities. It doesn't promote such qualities: the characters are too flawed. This is similar to the quantum mechanism of light -- is it a wave, or a particle? In one sense it exists at a captured moment in space, but in another it could be either real or unreal depending on the observer. That is what I mean by ""illumination"" of the subject matter. Both ""illumination"" and ""illusion"" share the same family of Latin roots.(3) You are left with a verbal cliff-hanger. But the film gives no evidence there could be any more story.At some point, the Professor went to Tesla for a teleport mechanism, leading to two possibilities: (A) Tesla and the Professor believe the teleport was unsuccessful. Later, The Professor meets his double outside, and they leave. Tesla is left none the wiser.(B) Similar to (A) except the Professor and his clone return to show Tesla what occurred.I suggest the latter. Tesla speaks gravely of the mechanism with Danton on the veranda. If Tesla didn't know that he was producing clones, he would have no reason to ward Danton away. This recurring theme of ""getting your hands dirty"" shows up here. If this was Tesla's own ""maiden voyage"" becoming acquainted with his machine, he would have no reason to be so reserved.We don't see who burns down Tesla's shop. Tesla and his assistant climb into their carriage, apparently with a huge, malfunctioning device that had already been paid for. In an inferno, are they going to spend time dismantling a huge apparatus and packing it up? At this point in his life, Tesla was quite used to rebuilding things. I posit that Tesla and his assistant burned down their own shop.The Professor only has one clone. In contrast, Danton unimaginatively lives out the flaw of the machine so that it becomes his own most tragic flaw. Recall the scene when he is half-drowning himself in the sink while trying to visualize what suffering his wife went through as she drowned in the ropes act, perhaps out of a lingering sense of guilt.Danton's first instinct at seeing the copy of himself was to shoot himself. The lineage of memories is only kept on with the Danton who survives. One Danton experiences that death, the other does not. It is explicitly stated by Danton that he never knows which Danton will die.Danton cared more about being in front of the audience than giving the audience any reason to applaud. He cared more about stealing his opponent's technique than about the memory of his own wife. It's enough to him that one ""part"" of him is going through his wife's torture, as long as the other ""part"" of him is basking in glory.The Professor's wife is treated poorly and the mistress was treated off-handedly. Both of those women took a secondary role to performance. Considering each Professor had so much to gain by sticking with his own woman, the only one real reason to switching was to make it believable. The women could be left to hang and to run, as long as they didn't ruin the act.Cutter himself is always in the dark. He doesn't know enough to make a moral decision, but he acts anyway. He gets one man killed while working for another man who gets 100 killed.There is no actually presented moralistic ideal. The wife may have been innocent, and may have been conscientious, but she left behind a child and a man who (at least every other day) genuinely loved her. She's the moral maximum in this story, but a relative maximum at best.At the end of the film, take stock: (i) One of the two Professors is dead.(ii) The Danton who survived a slew of clonings is dead.(iii) The remaining Professor has his daughter back.The only possible continuation of the story would be that Danton decided to allow one of his clones to live. The movie presents no evidence of such. If we say ""there is still be another Danton"", then we're just making things up.I would like to allude to the experimental hypothesis known as ""Schroedinger's Cat"". As soon as you open the box, you ""collapse"" the light's function to either a particle or a wave. Until that point, here is a mysterious existence wherein the cat is both alive and dead at the same time. The Professor is the one who opened the box and accepted fate for better or for worse.The film is largely an allegory of the failures and the successes of quantum physics, and a toast to the magic and mystery of the designs and discoveries of Nikola Tesla. Those are its primary features. So things like morals also get tossed into Schroedinger's box. But morals are absolute things. We don't say that ambivalent morals are still moral. Morals are treated as valid only when they are absolute and guarded. A person with changing or ambiguous morals is said to act either ethically or unethically, but their morals are no longer validated. And even ethics are considered to be culturally relative.The tease at the end with no further evidence is the film's send-off, its own lack of a ""prestige"", admission that the story is truly told in full."
" Was a great film for enjoyability and the story line and its production
",,Was an excellent film.One of Christian Bale's and Hugh Jackman's best performances as rivals. The production of the film is excellent as is the storyline. A film that is fun to watch sitting on the sofa with a big bowl of popcorn.A great family film or film to watch with friends. Will keep you entertained and you'll be able to watch it over and over again and it wont get boring.Bale's second best performance after Batman. Jackman's joint best performance going hand in Hand with Wolverine.A film full of Eye candy for the girls. Also for the boys there is action so a bit of both.
" Are you watching closely?....
",spoiler,"At the end of the Nineteenth Century, Robert Angier, his wife Julia and Alfred Borden are friends and assistants of a magician. When Julia accidentally dies during a performance, Robert blames Alfred for her death and they become antagonists to each other. Both become famous magicians, sabotaging the performance of the other on the stage. When Alfred performs a successful trick, Robert becomes obsessed trying to disclose the secret of his competitor with tragic consequences.....Easily Nolan's most underrated movie, it's also one of his best, because he is literally playing a magic trick on the audience, as further viewings prove that he is putting the film on screen, just how Caine explains the magic trick in the opening voice over.And once you realise this, you see just how clever the narrative and the editing is. We see Bales alter ego several times throughout the film, much like Tyler Durden in the opening minutes of Fight Club, and this is Nolan's sleight of hand to the audience.But the fundamental thing about the film is obsession, and how far one will go to find the ultimate answer to several questions. You give up love, life, and even sanity, to pursue your goal.The two leads are as fantastic as always, Johanssen is very poor, Michael Caine is as reliable as ever, and Bowie eerie looks and sounds like Pierce Brosnan.But the prestige part of this film, is that it has a wonderful ending, and you won't see it coming. Its one of those films, like seven, or the sixth sense, that will never have the same affect on you like it did the first time.Wonderful."
" A masterpiece!
",,"An absolutely brilliant film, one of my favorites! Keeps you thinking. Definitely one for those that liked Inception Bale's performance in this is brilliant, one of his best I feel (Perhaps only beaten by his performance in American Psycho). Jackman is also brilliant, and Caine of course great as usual :) My only disappointment is that I didn't see this before!!! Nolan did brilliantly with keeping the audience on edge and keeping them thinking. More twists and turns than... a twisty thing.A word of warning: you may have to watch it more than once to understand it all! I also advise you watch with subtitles, especially for the quieter bits"
" Best Mystery Movie I ever saw !!
",,"I just watched the movie, I was not knowing about it before, but when I searched for mystery movies above 8 stars, I found The Prestige. And when I watched it, I said "" Oh my God !! "", this is really amazing and Mysterious.I liked the hole story, from A to Z. The acting, the clothes, the twists, everything was amazing and joyful. The stars of this movie (Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman & Scarlett Johansson) were really stars and performing their turns with high precision. I want to see more movies like this one.Thanks for all who worked on this movie."
" A brilliantly structured thriller
",,"Two magicians compete with each other for the most complicated and impressive trick in Victorian London, and sacrifice everything to achieve it. That's basically the plot of the movie. A brilliantly structured thriller with great character orchestration, entertaining just like a magic show, that will restore your faith in American cinema. Christopher Nolan, inspired by dualism, has achieved something spectacularly fascinating. The contradiction between Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, emulation vs. violent competition, spiritual ideals vs. amoralism, and many more. One thing in one's life replaces something different from the other's. The dead wife of Angier substitutes the disappointed wife of Borden... The first's assistant becomes the second's mistress... The unprecedented magic trick of the teleported man can only be executed with an impostor, and so on.Metaphorically, Nolan 'plays' with the unlimited possibilities of illusion to talk about cinema in its simplest formation; its premature nature during which it captivates the young viewer. The Prestige is the final trick. Indeed, it does not omit to condemn the hubris, sacrificing its own cinematic nature with imperfections and little cracks, for reason to escape. Overall, 'The Prestige' is a wonderful movie with an interesting plot, great performances and a surprising twist ending. It's definitely worth your attention and, believe me, you'll have a nice time."
" The prestige of human's mind
",,"Two-hours pondering over the question - is there anything in that world wherein you can believe unreservedly in its veracity. Can we so easily confide in the apparent, aren't we the ones who let ourselves being fooled in the skillful illusion of the hidden and unknown. And when someone gives us a hint for that trick where the disappeared comes back we find the prestige of human's mind. Like a great magician Christopher Nolan makes the pledge, takes the turn and hand us the prestige. My total favourite. The flick is wonderfully engrossing mystery. That's the magic trick of the cinema- it spellbind you from the very beginning. I loved it to death. I want to see it again."
" Thought provoking and entertaining. A must see!
",,"The Prestige provokes thought the whole way through. It kept me guessing and every time I thought I knew what was going to happen there was another twist. It kept me interested and on the edge of my seat. It had multiple subplots that intertwined and layered perfectly together to deepen and advance the main plot. The film was a great representation of the time it was portraying. The relationships between the two magicians and the assistant were intense and very believable. I enjoyed the grand illusions and how a behind the scenes look at them was presented to the audience.So, you start off with a story that is exciting, thought provoking, new and exciting. Then you add a director with the caliber of Christopher Nolan and you know you have something that is purely amazing. Finally you cast actors with the talent and on screen chemistry of Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman, and Michael Caine and the final product? PURE GENIUS. Although I was enticed by Jackman and Caine's performances Bale is the one who really stole the spotlight for me. I have enjoyed every film that I have seen which Christopher Nolan has been apart of. It is a film like Inception and Donnie Darko in the sense that to truly understand and appreciate all of the elements in the film it needs to be seen more than once. The Prestige also exhibits similarities to these films in that they have a dark undertone and wildly interesting and captivating plots.I recommend this film to all of my friends. It definitely makes the cut for my all time top 10 favorite films."
" A very good film that appeals to more than the visual.
",spoiler,"Warning Contains Spoilers The Prestige is a suspense thriller that pits two magicians against each other. The first magician is Robert Angier, played by Hugh Jackman. The second magician is Alfred Borden, played by Christian Bale. The magicians are engaged in a battle to end up with the greatest magic trick the world has seen and the title of best magician.The Prestige centers on the human capacity for excellence and strive for more. At first, Borden is working for Angier. Eventually Borden strikes out on his own because he thinks that he is better. After a couple of personal incidents between the two, a brutal feud ensues. Their relationships end up failing because of the feud with each other. Borden eventually creates a trick that Angier is incapable of figuring out. This impossible trick forces Angier to look for another tactic for his tricks. Angier is contacted by a man named Tesla, played by David Bowie, who tells Angier that he might have what he is looking for. Tesla proceeds to show Angier an invention of his. Angier ends up asking Tesla to make a device for him, but Tesla has some doubts as to the ethical ramifications of this device. The device ends up being something that seems to be able to teleport Angier to other locations. The point in fact is the machine is cloning him.The lighting in the film is very spotted. It generally gives a focus to the character on the stage. The magicians are always lit up with light. There is point in the film where Angier is consulting with Tesla about the device and there is field of light bulbs, the light that is produced in this scene is intense. The scenes in the film that have Borden in prison are kind of natural colors with no added lighting. This type of scene adds to the mood of possible isolation and despair. The majority of the performances provide the point-of-view from the audience. The audience point of view allows the viewer to become just as oblivious as to what is actually going on as the rest of the audience.A film that had many similarities with The Prestige is Citizen Kane. Kane is a person that is not satisfied with what he given or has achieved. He always wants more. His marriages, friendships, and respect of his employees all came apart at the seams, because he was always striving for something that was not within his reach, love."
" Amazing, amazing, and again, just amazing.
",,"This film takes a great explained ride that leaves just enough to the imagination to make you wonder, but also not leaving you wanting to rip your hair out with questions. Firstly, excellent cast and acting, with Bale and Jackman really showing their elite status with really making these characters believable and heart felt. Secondly, the writing was great, with the tricks and the build ups being well done, not over doing it, nor under doing it. I must say that this is my favorite magicians film, and has set the standard for which many other films of the coming years will be compared. Can't believe it took me until 2013 to watch this. Watch it. And watch it now."
" it Made me think
",,"I saw this movie a few weeks ago and it's been on my list to watch for a while, At first the movie was a little slow but it started to pick up really quickly and the ending was magnificent and the cool thing about this ending was that it made you think and trust me you will be surprised. Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine, Did such a great job they look like completely different characters.Plus I loved the directing style of Christopher Nolan and the cinematography of Wally PfisterI highly recommend this movie."
" impressive battle between two men through a forgotten art
",,"The Prestige, I have to say, Mr. Nolan is close to my favorite filmmaker. Not only because he made superhero movies great films, but this man is also talented in other screenplays. For this one, for example, I'm not sure is it's his brother who got the idea, but the plot of two magicians engaging a battle for love and attacking each other by magic tricks is simply genius. Who the hell thought about that before, seriously? Great actor performances, stunning hot Scarlett Johansson and plus, he succeeds by making this film in another time of history and get appropriate costumes and landscapes. I think that this fact is a huge plus to any movie, whatever the subject is. It's pretty funny to see Hugh Jackman, who is the Wolverine, playing a total different kind of role, but it's nice to see also that he is a great actor even outside x-men movies, and for Bale, he is definitely getting a bigger place in my esteem for him and I think he is also a great actor. And oh God, the climax is so amazing! I'm not gonna say anything about it but I'm just gonna say that I almost jump of my couch when I saw it. Chris Nolan is definitely the man of modern films, keep making good stuff, I salute you."
" nonsense
",,"Rewatching The prestige on TV affirmed in the most definite way the impression I've formed regarding the cinema of Christopher Nolan:very ambitious but not having the faintest idea where it is heading.One should compare Nolan with Lynch(though I feel I'm getting blasphemous here) to understand how to tell the authentic and ingenious from the trivial and fake.Nolan comes again and again with ideas he believes are groundbreaking, and he finds his audience, I understand, but the whole concept of his movies is so pointless again and again (take Inception, The prestige, even the Batmans for examples), the final result incoherent for no reason at all(for there is incoherence that is meaningful, as Lynch and other great modern directors teach us), but for the reason of impressing the audience that buys the product the way they would eat up a blockbuster that is made following certain codes.To me it is a mystery how Nolan gets funding for these ridiculous scripts, and a greater mystery how he finally meets commercial success. But about this mystery I would like Lynch to make a movie, and definitely not Nolan himself."
" If I ever make films, this has a lot to do.
",,"PRESTIGE the film which cherishes the art of story telling. And I've cherished with it. The plot lines are so complex, it steals your attention. The performance by Christian Bale, Hugh Jackman and Michael Caine stole the scene. And the man to give real credit for The Nolan Brothers WOW!!! their screenplay are Oscar worthy. The story of the two rival magicians who are obsessed with their craft fights to get the best spot. But the screenplay is so huge that it boils down to the fight of their personal gains. It explores human obsession to not let it go and the tragic result of that. Human conflicts and emotions, Imagination and not able to imagine,creative and creative .It inspired me hope it inspires you."
" Just the greatest!
",,"After a long time i have seen a creative movie like this. ""Are you watching closely? Every magic trick consists of three parts, or acts. The first part is called ""the pledge."" The magician shows you something ordinary. A deck of cards, a bird or a man. He shows you this object. Perhaps he asks you to inspect it, to see that it is indeed real, unaltered, normal. But, of course, it probably isn't. The second act is called ""the turn."" The magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary. Now you're looking for the secret, but you won't find it, because, of course, you're not really looking. You don't really want to know. You want to be... fooled. But you wouldn't clap yet, because making something disappear isn't enough. You have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act. The hardest part. The part we call... ""the prestige."""". These are the first quotes of this movie and you will agree that it bears a certain allure and if I am not wrong you are going to watch the movie..."
" This film is something magical.
",spoiler,"When I first saw the prestige I was sick and I thought that it was a great movie, but would be better if I had the energy to think. So I watched it again a few days later and I was shocked to think that I thought this is what great. It is outstanding.The prestige is one of those movies were you find something new every time. I think I have watched this movie seven or eight times and I still find things that I missed in the other viewings.The story also proves what can happen when obsession takes over a person. This is done well between the two lead actors Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman, who try to work out the method behind each others magic tricks.But what actually makes this film as good as it is. Well there are to many things to talk about. First there is the terrific music by David Julyan. Then there is the marvellous acting from all the actors. Then add to that a twist that is so strange but yet so affective.A must see film for everyone. 10/10"
" Master Piece
",spoiler,"I am really impressed with The Prestige (2006). I only watched it recently because I've really became a fan of Christian Bale & Michael Caine, which only led to me being a bigger fan of them.One of the things I found surprising, is how Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) had a twin brother who actually cut his finger to complete their act. And how that led Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) to be so obsessed about magic and performing the ultimate illusion distracted him from really seeing what's happening around him, and how Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson) was playing him and originally working for Alfred.The storyline reminded me of the movie ""The Usual Suspects (1995)"" starring Kevin Spacey, even though each movie had a totally different title but both of them had an unexpected ending that really blew me away."
" Suspenseful, stylish and intelligent.
",,"I was quite interested to see The Prestige, I don't see how you couldn't be with such a great cast and director attached to it. The premise is what completely sold me. I don't think there's enough movies about magic, it can be bad if not done right, but when it's done right I just fall in love, it's just such an interesting subject. The Prestige is a magic movie done right. I love it.The film is about two magicians referred to as Angier and Borden, the two men were once partners and good friends, but after a horrible accident their relationship quickly fades. They're both both brilliant magicians, but Angier knows how to present himself and his tricks with style, and Borden doesn't. Borden is smarter then Angier however, and he constructs the most brilliant trick Angier has ever seen. Angier becomes obsessed with finding out the logic behind his trick, so he himself can perform this trick with the style that he is able to present with, making him the better magician.One thing that The Prestige does well with is magic, which you would expect from a film about magic but some films about magic don't get the whole thing right. What The Prestige does to make magic work well in the film is give logic behind the tricks, if it didn't do that the film would be nowhere near as good as it is. It just adds an extra layer of quality to the film. What I loved the most about The Prestige however was it's story and characters. The story is written with skill and intelligence, it's mind bending and sometimes challenging, but not to the point where you're lost and uninterested as the twists and turns start happening, you just need a good attention span to get the story. The film makes you think, but it never goes overboard with its complexity. The characters of the film are very interesting and believable. I found myself stuck as to who I was rooting for throughout the film, which one was actually the good guy, or even if either of them are the good guy. This is obviously the sign of well written characters.These well written characters would be pointless however if the characters weren't well portrayed. Luckily in this case, they are very well portrayed. Everyone in the film is great, can't really fault anyone if I'm honest. I'd say the best out of the bunch was Christian Bale (Borden) though, but Hugh Jackman (Angier) was still very good nevertheless. Even all the supporting actors give above average performances in the film. The film nails a really great tone throughout. It has a consistent atmosphere all the way through, it's dark and mysterious. The film is a period piece, and its sets and costumes really capture the feeling of the time. The striking cinematography is also a big help to that too. The Prestige is another brilliant mind bender from Christopher Nolan. If you're a fan of Nolan I'm sure you'll be pleased with this fantastic film."
" Review
",,"If you enjoy films of deception and mystery then you'll love The Prestige.

" Extraordinary work of mr Nolan
",,"Mr Nolan did it again.... add this extraordinary piece of genius with The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises. Ii had no expectation of this movie, and to be honest i don't remember knowing this movie existed...or perhaps i forgot. But this movie is a piece of ART and EXTRAORDINARY MASTER PIECE. Jonathan and Christopher helped write this and they were brilliant at it. Christian Bale the perfectionist actor, did it again, he was brilliant. The way they made this movie so that the viewers could escape to their fantasy world was incredible. With a twist at the end too, like the cherry on a cake. Brilliant, interesting, thrilling, entertaining tale. Well done at the whole team/cast for making this movie a masterpiece! A must watch if your a fan of Christopher Nolans work!!!!"
" Amazing twists & turns - mind blowing!
",,This is one of those films that i ended up encouraging family and friends to watch... a must see in my opinion. Christian Bale did an amazing job as did Michael Caine and Hugh Jackman. Christopher Nolan directed this and id say without a doubt this is his best movie by a mile!2 magicians at war trying to discover each others tricks which quickly becomes an obsession rather then rivalry. The more they obsess about trying to better the other one the story gets darker what unfolds before our eyes is amazing. The ending of this film made me want to watch the whole thing again and on doing so you see so many things you didn't pick up on the first time around. Don't hesitate to watch this and pay attention whilst doing so. A few friends of mine have watched it and don't seem as crazy about it as me but when we discuss the plot its clear that they didn't pay real attention to the full dialogue going on. You can get lost if you miss vital parts of this story so make sure you watch it with your eyes and ears wide open!10 out of 10 for me. This is what i call a classic must watch movie.
" Great!
",spoiler,"Just awesome! I know that's saying much but I mean it... I have watched a lot of movies, new and old. Like most anyone, I really like this movie. I'm not sure why it was rated PG-13...but then again it couldn't as well have been rated PG.... but I saw nothing in it that was PG-13 Worthy... Seeing how mostly PG-13 movies now and days can slip one ""F"" word in the movie... I was searching hard to try and find this one... and I could not. I do remember hearing a few words but no one seems to really care about it as much. But as for the speech that was good. The story was great! It kept you guessing and wondering what was going on. I love that aboot a movie!! :) I was on the edge of my seat the whole time... the story was just amazing and left you so ... just amazingly lost!!! If you love magic or love to know how things are done.. Here is a great twist for you...watch and fall in love with the thrill and mystery of the whole movie!... In Short... I love love LOVE the Prestige!"
" Keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout
",,"Well I've been meaning o watch this movie for awhile now but have never gotten around to it. Finally today I sat down and watched it and I was amazed, in essence this movie is beautiful. The acting by both Jackman and Bale is astonishing. Also Michael Caine preforms another fantastic role, not to my surprise of course. I also must give praise to Nolan for this adaption of the original book.The plot was well driven and never got stale. It kept me guessing the whole time and it was full of twists and turns. After it was over I was left in an astonished. I really recommend this movie to a sophisticated audience who doesn't mind a long, mysterious movie."
" This reminds me of... Lance Armstrong?!?!...
",spoiler,"This is going to be short, not much to say, the title of my post sums it all up. What i felt when i found out that the great American champion took performance enhancing drugs i also felt when that ridiculous number of hats in Tesla's garden appeared on the screen. I felt that the producers of this film cheated. And after years since first seeing this movie, it seems they got away with it... unlike Lance. Because the film still has a great score on this site and not only. Sure, there was some great tension and cleverness to it, the acting was pretty cool, nice costumes and so on, but... A CLONING MACHINE?!?!?!!!!!!! COME ON!!!"
" Amazing movie except the sci fi element in the end
",spoiler,"It is an amazing movie but the sci fi element in the revelation in the end puts you off...it could easily have been Angier's double who drowns in the tank, but then Nolan screws it just in the very end. Though the plot and script makes it one of the best movies I have ever seen.Watch it for the suspense and for the revelation of Borden's ""the Transporting Man"" trick. And also the exceptional performances from all including Michael Caine.Christopher Nolan is simply amazing.Watch it for the suspense and for the revelation of Borden's ""the Transporting Man"" trick. And also the exceptional performances from all including Michael Caine."
" The plot is too trickery; the payoff is flat
",,"Two magicians seek to revenge against each other, by trying to destroy each other. The premise is intriguing, but the delivery is trickery. This is the Nolan brothers' movie that went a bit too labored. The plot is awkward, just like the walk of the Chinese magician (portrayed in the movie who did the goldfish trick), and the wisdom dispensed is too stretched (about ""sacrifice"") . Even its analogy about the audience seeking a moment of escape from the miserable world they are living in by going to see a magic show (as comparing to going to a movie) is a cliché.The characters were mostly miscast, from the two leading roles (the magicians) to their women (Scarlett Johansson in particular). Not that those actors are not talent; just they are misfit for this early 20th century London scene. Only Michael Caine came cross creditable and convincing.If this movie were a magic show, then, despite of the fanfare of all three acts-- Pledge, Turn and Prestige, the payoff for the audiences is as flat as the bird being snapped upon in the cage."
" Great movie, but I had too big expectations of the ending
",spoiler,"Really great movie, but I had too big expectations about the ""twisty ending"". The acting was great, Christopher Nolan did a great job and the ending was good, but... I read a few reviews, so, I knew there was going to be some kind of ""twisty ending"". I was way too prepared and I even predicted the ending. This resulted in me having the feeling ""Is that it?"". So, I am advising you NOT to have too high expectations,just in case. Though, after a while, I saw the movie in a more objective perspective, and I realized how much I actually did enjoy it, even though I ruined it for myself... :) But it really is a movie worth watching :)"
" Closest to a masterpiece there is!!!
",spoiler,"If you read the comments of the people who ""hate"" this movie its very obvious they all fall into the category of borderline ""think they are real critics"". They're the ones who give movies like ""Avengers"" and ""The Dark Night"" 1/10's and believe any movie made after the 1960's without the high school drama overacting is horrible. If Christopher Nolan only knew people stuck back in that time still made a difference today, he would probably remake The Prestige and not reveal any secrets in the Prestige. Cause that's the REAL problem for them. They don't seem to grasp that Christopher Nolan actually KNOWS them better than they know themselves. ""The trick means EVERYTHING!!! Reveal the secret, and you're NOTHING!"" Sad to say, the concept of the movie was its ironic demise. On a more realistic note, if you know secrets to any ""magic"" trick then you know there is nothing magic about it! The secret is ALWAYS ALWAYS disappointing. Thus the ending as sci-fi as it is, THERE SHOULD BE NO DISAPPOINTMENT!!!NOW, for a real idea of what the film portrays. Things to expect and things to just get over. It takes place during the ""OLD"" days. Twist after twist. After you finish the movie, watch it again because like any magic trick if you watch VERY closely the secret is always right in front of you! You just never noticed! OR, maybe you just don't want to see it. Let's face it, an obvious trick is not really worth knowing/learning.9/10 because as great as the story is, it could only have been executed under the restrictions/limitations (inconsistencies) that the director takes advantage of and where the plot took place in. ***SPOILER ALERT*** If you know any identical twins personally, you know other than their looks they are for the most part different in every way. I don't know any identical twins with the same voice, same eyes, or same gestures. They might scratch their heads with the same hand but their hands themselves feel and look different!

",spoiler,"""Are you watching closely?"" opens this film about magic, rivalry, betrayal, love and tragedy. I'm not really into movies about magic, but 'The Prestige' to me is really more of a drama about the rivalry between Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) than it is about magic itself. At the film's start, Borden is on trial for the death of his former friend and rival, Angier who drowned in a water tank upon completing a trick. How did these two become rivals? The first flashback of the film tells the viewer that Borden and Angier were once partners in the business along with Angier's wife, Julia (Piper Perabo) but one tragic night Julia drowns during a performance when she cannot escape her rope bindings. Angier places the blame squarely on Borden and swears to destroy his former friend's life.Without giving too much more away, the film's tension escalates dramatically as both Jackman and Bale's characters descend further into the treacherous rabbit hole of secrets, lies and betrayal. This leads the viewer to wonder who else will fall victim to the all-consuming obsession of Jackman's Angier in his endless pursuit to ruin Borden.In the leading roles of Robert Angier and Alfred Borden, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale couldn't be more different. Jackman is brash, arrogant and narcissistic as Angier while Bale is soft-spoken, more reserved and secretive as Borden. The actors play off each other brilliantly as the magicians wage war for the best in their profession; an unending cat and mouse game that pulls the viewer further into the depths of their heated rivalry. Since we are given the film from both their perspectives, it is almost impossible to know which character to trust for the truth. Among the film's supporting performances are a heart-wrenching Rebecca Hall as Borden's wife, Sarah, who becomes the final innocent victim in the dangerous web her husband is entangled in, Scarlett Johannson as the duplicitous Olivia Wenscombe, Angier's assistant turned traitor by Borden when Angier dispatches her to learn his rival's secrets, Michael Caine as John Cutter, Angier's ingenuier (one who designs the illusions for a magic show) who warns Jackman's obsessive Angier that his pursuit will only end badly, Andy Serkis (most famous for his motion-capture performances as Gollum in the ""Lord of the Rings"" series) as Alley, (fictional) assistant to famed scientist, Nikola Tesla and in a mesmerizing cameo as the famed electrical pioneering scientist is the distinguished David Bowie who holds nothing back in his portrayal of Tesla; even adopting a convincing Eastern European accent to cover his native British accent. The narrative is gripping, full of twists and turns like a magic show, but it never ceases to pull the rug away with the exposure of what is real and what is illusion. We are never certain what really motivates Angier and Borden even when they give their own reasons to other characters (example: Angier tells Olivia that he wants to ruin Borden for damaging his new illusion; not in revenge for Julia's death early in the film). The ultimate climax contains the film's best shocking moments as the web is finally unraveled, but there are still questions left that we'll never get the answer to. But the question is: do we really want to know or do we want to be fooled?"
" Great story - too many hints
",spoiler,"Loved the story but missed getting the surprise ending (prestige) because they were a bit too heavy handed with the hints, although I was helped by having seen that it was classified as Science Fiction. The only thing I hadn't figured out half way through was what the surviving twin would do and so what the fate of Jess Borden was.There's a fine line between giving enough hints so that at the end you look back and see that you should have figured it out and giving so many hints that the end is clear early in the movie. They crossed that line.All the actors were adequate - even David Bowie but none of the performances were outstanding. This doesn't worry me. The roles didn't require outstanding performances so it didn't detract from the movie.The story could have been handled better."
" Were you watching closely?
",,"This movie is a masterpiece in the way that it tells a story. You know a movie is fantastic if it can give everything away within the first five minutes, and still manage to keep you guessing until the end, and that is exactly what this movie does. Christopher and Jonathan Nolan wrote an amazing screenplay dealing with sacrifice, deception, intrigue, and fierce competition. Paired with Christopher Nolan's strong direction, this movie becomes quietly mysterious, and incredibly fascinating.All you simply need to do is watch--except watch closely. Everything in this movie happens for a reason, and just about every line is extremely important. Seemingly small events impact the entire movement of the film, while larger one brood in the background and affect everything from the characters' actions to the way they deal with situations. In this movie you must realize the importance of sacrifice, for each man is obsessed with having the best magic trick more than anything else, and therefore willing to give up pretty much anything in order to achieve this. Both of their lives are changed forever for one, seemingly simple trick which they both go about doing in different, equally as difficult ways. The acting, too, is very good, especially Christian Bale, who is slowly tormented by his all- consuming trick, and Michael Caine, who has a change of heart after discovering the true motives of Hugh Jackman, whom he works for, and who is determined to seek revenge. Throughout the movie, they both lose so much, and yet they both stay on the track of deception and obsess over this one trick. The eerie, building music demonstrates their quest and journey towards fulfillment, and compliments the darker tones of the film. Overall, if you are willing to think, this movie as a must-see. Just remember--watch closely, because, as Michael Caine says in the movie, ""making something disappear isn't enough; you have to bring it back."""
" Starts strong, then leads to a disappointing conclusion
",,"The Prestige is a perfect example of a film that starts off pretty damn good, but then falls flat at the end. It overall is worth watching, and is enjoyable and interesting in parts, but it isn't a masterpiece.I'm going to start with the stuff I liked this time, the acting is great, I really thought that Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman hated each other. The direction is great, it's a very good looking film, I think in terms of direction this is actually one of Nolan's better films. It has a good plot, even if it is far fetched. The production value is also worth noting, really feeling like the late 19th century, well except maybe Tesla in the middle, but that would be spoiling to much so I won't say what it does. Overall for the most part the movie works really well.Then at the end this movie decides to have a twist ending. I actually knew the twist before, so I was looking for clues, like something like THe Sixth Sense, and what I found out is that this twist ending doesn't make any sense at all. This isn't even really a twist, it's more of a ""got ya"" moment. There's no clues, no lead up, the twist is just there so the movie can feel more cool than it needs to be. If any of you can explain how this twist makes any sense, please let me know.So yes, The Presige is a good movie for the most part, it starts off pretty strong, but then goes into a very disappointing conclusion."
" Magic Done Right
",,"The Prestige is a complicated thriller directed by Christopher Nolan. A magician, Alfred Borden(Christian Bale), is in jail for murdering a rival, Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman). Both were working with Milton and his sidekick, John Cutter(Michael Caine). During a magic act with Angier's wife, Julia, she drowned, and Borden was blamed for using the wrong knot when tying her up.The two become enemies, sabotaging each others acts. Angier ruins Borden's bullet catch, which costs him two fingers, and Borden pays Angier back by wrecking his bird act, which injures a member of the audience. Borden comes up with the transported man, where he enters one cabinet and comes out another. Angier copies it by hiding under the stage. He finds Nikola Tesla(David Bowie)and has him build a real transportation machine. Thomas Edison sends some people to burn the lab, and Tesla warns Angier to destroy the device. Of course, the inventor is ignored, and this leads us to a big surprise ending, which worked for me. Nolan uses beautiful sets with intricate tricks and excellent acting, all around. The Prestige is a top notch mystery."
" I'm under no illusion. This is phenomenal!
",,"Move over you Nolan sisters because we have new Nolan talents in town! Christopher and Johnathan Nolan (the Nolan brothers, as I like to affectionately call them) already crafted a masterpiece from ""Memento"" with Johnathan coming up with the idea and Chris turning it into a screenplay and fantastic film, and now they've both worked on the screenplay adapted from the book, ""The Prestige"" once again with Chris in the drivers seat, he does not give a disappointing ride. I've almost seen all of Christopher Nolan's films now, with me giving most of them a 10, which is why I was incredibly excited for ""The Prestige"" and why my expectations were high. Luckily they were met.As soon as the film started I knew that I was going to love it. It just had Chris' fingerprints all over it, a great feeling of scale and scope, which he multiplied by ten to give us the exceptional ""Inception"". We are immediately thrown in to the world of a magician and we immediately care about this world and the characters in it. Like all of Nolan's films, it is incredibly involving and sucks you in, making you wish it would never end! ""The Prestige"" is pure escapism, and although is much less confusing than ""Memento"" and ""Inception"" it certainly is no less intelligent.Chris has a knack of presenting confusing ideas in an accessible way. ""The Prestige"" should be a mess with it consistently moving backward and forward in time, but with Nolan it completely works and helps to make it even more thrilling than it already is. The directing is stylish and the sets lavish. There's a wonderful Victorian atmosphere, with beautiful lofty settings, (such as the theatres) it's a real treat for the eyes and with a wonderful scores by Hans Zimmer, it's an equal treat for the ears too.But it's the story and well-handled themes that keep this film ticking. I wouldn't read into this film too much, just like with ""The Cabin in the Woods"" all you need to know is that some friends spend the night at a cabin, all you need to know with ""The Prestige"" is that it's about a bitter rivalry from two magicians. Both of them as malicious as each other, although I did feel more for Hugh Jackman's character (though that might be just because I don't like Christian Bale as much). Both magicians rise to stardom, but once Christian performs an incredible trick (presented in such a genius simplistic and underwhelming way) it leaves Hugh in an obsessive quest to perform it.The theme of obsession is explored deeply, similarly to ""Black Swan"" (although of course no where near that great!) and you, the audience, suddenly becomes involved too. The pacing is relentless, just like in any Christopher Nolan film and so the film feels incredibly long, although I don't mean that in a negative way at all, if anything it's positive because it has a truly epic feeling that's hard to wash away after the credits roll up. It's also full of mesmerising twists and turns that actually had me gasping at times! All leading up to a jaw-dropping ending that would be a tragedy if you knew about it before watching it. Of course the most genius thing about the film is that it's written in the same structure as a magic trick! ""The Prestige"" is another masterpiece from Christopher Nolan, who's up there with Darren Aronofosky for making consistently amazing films (although I do prefer Darren's incredible visual style). ""The Prestige"" is thoroughly entertaining and pure escapism. The writing and directing are top notch and deliver a mesmerising film of both quality and quantity. It is absolutely gripping and absorbing, making you try to work out the impossible puzzle with Hugh! Some scenes were heart-pounding and seriously exciting and the climax is powerful as well as holding a good moral. See ""The Prestige"", the world's greatest film about magic tricks!"
" One of those movies that gets better every time that you see it
",,"The first time through, The Prestige is just a sort of intriguing film to watch, where the pageantry of the magic shows is about half of the attraction. When an implausible sci-fi twist comes along and makes the last half hour a great big WTF experience, it can be kind of disappointing. But if you watch it again, you'll see a lot more in it. This isn't just a movie about magic and figuring out how Robert Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) perform their greatest tricks. This is a story about the self-destructive nature of obsession and revenge, and about how you can't make an omelet without breaking a few eggs. The second time through this movie, with a bit of perspective on what it all means, it gets better. You realize the massive sacrifices that Borden and Angier will make in an endless attempt to one-up one another.From the beginning, the movie does a great job of setting up Borden and Angier as rivals. Borden is great at the technical aspects of being an illusionist, but he has no charisma or style. Angier, on the other hand, understands the ""show"" part of show business much better. It is almost painful to watch Borden perform his show with no personality in front of small crowds, while Angier dazzles much larger audiences with charm and pizazz. At some point though, Angier discovers that Borden has come up with a new magic trick. He becomes obsessed with finding out how Borden is doing the trick, resorting to extreme measures before finally coming up with his own version of it. From there, the feud continues to escalate. To say that this movie is wholly unpredictable would be putting it lightly. From the beginning, you never have a really good idea of where it is going or whether there is a formula at work. The last half hour will definitely surprise you. It might not satisfy you, but you won't see it coming.The Prestige is strong evidence that the quality of a Christopher Nolan film is inversely proportional to its funding. Lacking the $100+ Million CGI budget of a film like Inception, Nolan focuses more in this movie on script and atmosphere. There are about a half dozen magic show scenes in this movie, and every one of them is a treat to watch. Unlike the loud (and sometimes obnoxious) Hans Zimmer scores that have populated Nolan's last couple of movies, The Prestige has a low key score, much more in the style of Memento.The big drawback that I see to this film is that in typical Nolan fashion, the time line bounces around, to the point where the movie can be confusing the first time that you see it. Unlike Batman Begins and Memento, however, it's kind of pointless here. I can see no reason why this movie wouldn't have been better if it had been shown in chronological order. The film is complex enough as it is. It kind of hints that it is an allegory for the bitter feud between Nicola Tesla and Thomas Edison, which occurred during this time period. It is one of those movies where you will probably notice something new every time that you see it, even after five viewings.If you haven't seen The Prestige, then I highly encourage you to see it. If you saw it and you weren't very impressed, then I highly encourage you to give it a second chance. I enjoyed the movie on my first viewing, and it gets better every time that I see it."
" Nolan's Exceptional Venture into the World of Magic
",,"After reinventing the Batman franchise and reminding audiences how awesome they can be when Joel Schumacher isn't involved, director Christopher Nolan took the time to do his own thing. The result was THE PRESTIGE, further proof that Nolan doesn't need a man in a bat costume to prove how awesome a director he is. Nolan is one of the best directors in modern Hollywood for weaving a gripping story with powerful performances from his cast. In THE PRESTIGE, Nolan introduces the audience to the behind-the-scenes world of magic (stage magic, not fantasy magic) with the tale of two rising magicians with an ongoing feud that ultimately consumes both of their lives. Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) are a couple of magician's assistants/audience plants with aspirations of rising to the top in the world of magic. When a botched escape act ends with the death of Angier's wife, Angier blames Borden and the two part ways as Angier stews with thoughts of vengeance. As Borden goes on to make a name for himself, Angier rages at the thought that Borden be given success after what he'd done and begins a war of escalation as each tries to sabotage the other's acts. The war between the two reaches a new level when Borden debuts a new act called the Transported Man and Angier becomes obsessed with learning the secret, eventually turning to infamous scientist Nikola Tesla to harness the power of science in creating his own version.I love Nolan's movies and this one ranks high as one of his best in my opinion. The story keeps you guessing, the performances are strong, and I absolutely love the setting. The film is set in 19th century England and takes us behind the curtain as magicians devise their latest illusions to baffle audiences. That alone would've made this movie worth my interest, but Nolan's tale of vengeance and obsession brings the movie a whole other level. I love a good magic show and a glimpse into the creation/execution of classic illusions secured my interest, while the incorporation of science elements with the use of Tesla as a plot element turns the whole concept of magic on it's head with his invention. By that point in the film, it had started slipping into the realm of science fiction, which sort of derailed it a bit. It made for an interesting final act, but it was asking for a bit too much suspension of disbelief. I'm no scientist but, come on, you don't need to be to realize that Tesla's invention in the film is an impossibility. Until this point in the film, it was grounded firmly in reality without stooping to ""real magic"" and the sudden inclusion of this miracle machine, while interesting enough, messes with the feel of the movie. Regardless, the film isn't necessarily about the Transported Man or Tesla, it's about the war between Angier and Borden and in that sense the film is a great success.The story is made powerful by the performances of the two leads: Jackman and Bale. Both men are fantastic actors and create characters that are equal parts sympathetic and detestable. Each one is suffering in their own way: Angier with the death of his wife and Borden with his unwavering commitment to his craft despite how it might affect his personal life. I love that the movie, for a while, leaves the question of who is the film's protagonist hazy. You would believe from the beginning that Angier is the hero, merely seeking retribution for his loss, but later in the film the audience perception shifts and we begin to realize that the Angier's obsession has corrupted him beyond reason and suddenly Borden is the victim. Honestly, each man in the movie engages in acts of violence and cruelty, and neither can really be considered the ""good"" guy. I think that's what makes this movie that much more interesting: there is no real hero. Just a couple of incredibly flawed human beings caught up in something that explodes out of proportion, performed to perfection by Jackson and Bale. The supporting cast is loaded with equal talent: Michael Caine as Angier's engineer, Scarlett Johansson as a magician's assistant caught in the middle, David Bowie (!) as Nikola Tesla, and Andy Serkis as his assistant. The production design in the movie is incredible and the cast is powerful. If it weren't for the bizarre sci-fi turn in the middle of the movie, this movie would be perfect."
" Amazing
",,"An amazing movie hands down. Slow to begin with but builds up. If your are interested in magic this is a must see. ""The Prestige"" is a little boring but you have to watch through it. Hugh Jackman is amazing and i couldn't even tell he was wolverine. Must see. Must see. Must see. Not the best movie Iv'e seen but certainly the best in a while. Yes. Its good. I cant say much else because this movie can get spoiled in so many ways. Must see. Must see. must see must see must see. Alfred from Batman is in it and he does a great job as somewhat a neutral character who you can't hate. So many twists and turns, so great. Must see. Must see. Must see."
" One of my favourite films of all time
",,"This has got to be one of the most original films I've ever seen, the idea of magicians pitting their illusionist skills against each other to see who's the first to cross the line is perfect for the sensibilities of Chris Nolan. The movie has his trademark non-chronological storytelling, which is a little confusing at first, but it actually enhances the smoke and mirrors quality of the film; it unfolds just like how the characters play out their tricks - the pledge, the turn, the prestige. The characters are all tortured and haunted in some way, what started off as friendly competition escalates into an obsessive bitter rivalry where nothing is sacred in order to get the one-up on the other. Simply brilliant!"
" Best film I've seen since Inception! Magical story and spectacular acting!
",,"Brilliantly executed story and the acting is above superb. I had no doubt with the cast line up that the acting would be anything less than well, magical. This truly is the best film I've seen since Inception and I truly wonder why I have not heard more people going on about this film. Could it be too complicated for most audiences? I really hope that is not the case because the film is too extraordinarily awesome to go unseen. The only reason I didn't rate the film a 10 out of 10 is due to the complicated nature of the film. If it had been easier to understand, like Inception, which isn't all that easy, I would have given it that 10. At the same time, if the film was any simpler I don't know if it would be as mind blowing as it is. Thank you Mr. Nolan for another original and unusually fantastic ride!

" Puzzle
",,"puzzle of magic, hate, competition, fame and errors. good script, impressive cast. and precise acting. one real smart movie in which every detail has its perfect place. so, the show is only cloth. essence - human fight against yourself. friendship as seed of cruel competition, out of limits, behind any price.at end - strange taste of victory. sure, a world of shadows must be a trap. but nuances of feelings, game of masks, the final truth are only instruments for describe dark circles. the best ingredient is, for me, art of David Bowie to create a very interesting Tesla. the Croatian inventor is more than realistic character, new Faust, key of a fake triumph and convert out of rules of a magician. it is central piece for give profound nuances for competition. death of a era and drawing of new age. pink skin for a time and its cages. glory and crimes. in fact - portrait of our young century."
" Hoped I would have liked it more.
",spoiler,"I sat down to watch this with quite high expectation as anything rated 8+ is usually a good watch.Right away I had to adjust the sound so I could hear Christian Bale,s dialogue. His delivery was so often under this breath and his thick East London accent made we struggle to understand him.I understand that atmosphere is created by various visual means but why were so many shots filmed underlit for no justifiable reason? Just about every scene was in darkness I found that I was straining to see what was on the screen.I also found that the HJ character had practically no backstory. His destructive obsession had me wondering what fueled this obsession or did something from his past trigger this.Between straining to understand CB and squinting to see what was on the screen I found myself too distracted from the plot. This was a long film and felt longer than it actually was.Christian, drop the barrow boy accent and speak up!!!! Mr Nolan, put a light on or open the curtains!!!!"
" Winner by a margin
",,"I went to see a critics preview of The Prestige this afternoon and to my surprise I found the film to be one of the best I have seen all year so far, and that writers can come up with an excellent script it they would only try a little harder. The acting performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale and Michael Caine were the best I have see in a long while. The only objection I had to the film was that it was a little long, but once you leave the theater you will discuss the film and it many twists and turns. My wife and myself discussed it all the way home from the movie theater. This is a winner and should be up for some academy award statues, and my recommendation is go see this as soon as you can, you will not be disappointed."
" Classic tale of rivalry and vengeance
",,"Very few words can be used to describe this film, in every aspect of this movie it portrays that of the enticing idiosyncratic feeling that will blow your mind.I was pleased at how well the characters held their own in this movie they contributed a great deal and they did not disappoint in that respect.Christopher Nolan I must say you are a genius who eclipsed the way movies are meant to be made.A well written script to support a lead of desirable events that take place with the sort of impression that will be imprinted in the minds of anyone who appreciates the arts.Thumbs up to the cast as well as everyone who was involved in the production of this film.It will certainly be placed in my category of films of the decade."
" OK Movie, BUT a failure as an adaptation!
",,"When I first watched this movie, I thought it was brilliant. It's well acted, and the plot's pretty good. HOWEVER, then I found the novel by Christopher Priest in a second hand book shop. I've only recently finished reading the novel ""The Prestige"", and I have to say, the plot of the novel is so much better than the plot of the movie. After reading it, I've begun to wonder whether the Nolan's actually FINISHED reading it before they adapted it into a movie, since the plot of the movie is missing the most major plot point, which becomes obvious at the ending of the novel. To everyone who has complained about the use of Tesla's machine in the movie; READ THE BOOK, it's purpose is pivotal to the ending of the novel; a part of the plot which isn't even used in the movie!!! So, as a stand alone film, I would give Nolan's ""The Prestige"" 8/10, but Christopher Priest's novel deserves 10/10, and the fact that the movie neglects main parts of the novel for me pulls down it's rating as an adaptation by a lot..."
" if you believe in tricks ... you have to keep secrets..
",,"A great magician experience from Chistopher Nolan. It is a perfectly crafted mind game. Christian Bale was incredible and unforgettable as an overly eccentric magician(s). It was also one of the best performances from the Powerhouse known as Hugh Jackman . i just saw this movie last night and let me tell you, this movie had me guessing the whole time because usually you could predict the plot of the move but not this time,twist over twist over twist... this is one of the few movies ever made the keep on shocking you, also the ending is probably better than any movie from 2000-present and no lie. some people say that there is no hero but once you see this movie, you will understand because greed, pride and obsession are the key factors so if you miss the movies that have a bang for your buck, after all Jack & Bale effect..... can't leave.."
" Christopher Nolan's best Suspense masterpiece
",,"This is one of the best movies i have ever seen in my life... Christopher Nolan is simply superb.The plus points in this movie are STORY, DIRECTION and PERFORMANCE... Before i watched this movie i was sure that ""I AM GOING TO LIKE THIS MOVIE""....... So i watched and the movie is full of twists...There is no doubt that whoever watches this movie will be surprised by every twist...Even though the whole movie is all about how Christian BALE and HUGH JACK MAN take revenge on each other, it is EXCELLENT.... And....... The people who haven't seen this movie WILL be shocked when they watch the ending....I recommend this movie to everyone.... WHAT AN ENDING!!!!! 10/10"
" Prestige of Nolan
",,"All right. Now this was one of the best movies I have ever watched. Christopher Nolan has never made any bad movies yet. Powerful screenplay, the end was shocking and I am still watching The Prestige over and over again to fin different ideas about what happened to Angier. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were acting really good. Bale won an Oscar with The Fighter but I think he should won another Oscar with Prestige. If the disappearing bird trick is real, too bad to those poor birds. But because of this movie, the audience aren't enjoying that trick in magic shows which is a good thing. Their ideas about Tesla Reactor was also very impressive. So let me get this straight; once again Christopher Nolan made a movie which changed my life."
" Excellent again from Nolan!
",,"For the record, I have seen this film before, but this is the first time I've attempted a review. I will admit to being a growing fan of Christopher Nolan's work, ever since the excellent 'Inception' last year I have tried to see all of his work whenever possible. Although not perfect, this is a fine example of his work, a beautifully crafted story that is both compelling and very mysterious. But more of my thoughts later, here's a brief summary first (summary haters and those that don't wish to know anything about the plot please enjoy the magic show while I write the next paragraph).Every great magic trick consists of three acts; 'The Pledge', 'The Turn' and 'The Prestige'. Now, I could tell you what they all mean, but Michael Caine does it so much better in the trailer. But I digress; we're here to talk about the plot. Two magicians, Alfred Borden and Robert Angier are working together when tragedy strikes. Angier's wife, Julia, is killed in an on-stage accident. He blames Borden for her death and thus begins a bitter rivalry. They both set out alone to be the better magician and both make every effort to thwart the other. Eventually Borden creates a trick that Angier cannot figure out and from then it's no holds barred. In search of the answer he goes to America to seek the help of scientist Nikola Tesla. What he creates for Angier is quite mind-blowing and very dangerous. But the secret to Borden's trick is not what you may think. I think I've said enough and so I'll leave it there.As you might expect from a Christopher Nolen film, it is very well made with great cinematography, great sets, costumes and, not least, performances. Great work from both Christian Bale as Alfred Borden and Hugh Jackman as Robert Angier, both are superb in this one. Also great to see were Michael Caine as Cutter and Scarlett Johansson as Olivia Wenscombe. And I must give honourable mentions to Andy Serkis as Alley and David Bowie (yes him) as Tesla.I have seen this one before and so could remember a good portion of the plot while re-watching it. Even so, I found it quite compelling; I love the way the audience are drawn into the story. It may not have the scope of The Dark Knight or Inception, and it may not be quite as crazy as Memento, but it's still a great example of his work. As I said at the beginning, it's not perfect, I felt some of the early scenes were a little rushed and a little more time could have been spent on 'The Pledge' without ruining 'the Prestige' (just a little magician joke there). Over all, very compelling, excellently made with some great performances Highly Recommended.My score: 8.6/10"
" Are YOU watching closely?!
",,"Christopher Nolan is a genius, I must say. You'll find this movie on anyone's favorite list, given that they've watched this movie. I, for one, wasn't very keen on watching this movie. But when I did, believe me when I say this, it shook me down to the core. I never write spoilers and never do I tell people in my reviews who's doing what in the movie. I concentrate mainly on what as we, as viewers as well as humans, take out of the movie. And there's a lot you can take out of this movie. It teaches you how jealousy makes you forget the difference between good and bad. How in anger one gets so blinded that while trying to hurt others one hurts himself, and the people he loves, the most. Christian Bale is stupendous in this movie, one thing I can't stop blabbering bout.Anyway, back to the movie again, somehow people might say that the movie's ending was the best part. On the contrary, I believe that once you're through the movie and if you critically analyze the movie you'd realize that the parts in between were the most fascinating parts. I must say it was written so finely that everything makes sense to the viewer.I rate this movie as one of the most defining movies of the decade and it defines the man who made this movie. To sum it all, if you watch it WATCH IT CLOSELY!"
" Are you watching closely?
",spoiler,"Are you watching closely? Christopher Nolan is shaping up to be one of this century's most successful directors, delivering hit after hit, quality upon quality. The only exception to that would be the tedious ""Insomnia"", but at his best he is a movie making genius, at his worst, an efficient director.""The Prestige"" was produced between projects, those being numbers three and four in my all time top ten, ""Batman Begins"" and ""The Dark Knight"". He claimed that he was making a small movie to tide him over but ended up with an all start blockbuster, and whist touching of a subject which had been dealt with before, I don't recall it ever having being done quite like this.And that is the magic of a top director; That is to give the audience what they want but not on their terms, not quite what they are expecting. This film follows the obsession of two 19th century magicians, one of whom, Christian Bale, arrives at the conclusion that it takes total commitment to achieve the perfect trick, whilst Hugh Jackman takes a little longer to see that obsession will lead him down the same path.This is a dark, Gothic thriller, lifting the lid of the magic of the day, whilst in true Nolan fashion delving deeper into the psyche of the protagonists, and the destructive nature of their respective obsessive battles, and those it hurts and destroys along the way.But more than this, the film its self is effectively a mirror of the plot, told and presented as one long trick, with deception, red herrings and ultimately, eponymous the prestige. The only real problem I have with this film is that it thinks that it has everything so well wrapped up, that we, the audience, can't see the twists coming, which I felt a little insulted by as they were almost telegraphed.But, this was a methodically well presented film, with a clear time and excellent performances throughout. Highly recommended."

",spoiler,"From director Christopher Nolan (Memento, Insomnia, The Dark Knight, Inception), released near about the same time as The Illusionist starring Edward Norton and Paul Giamatti, both films have strong similarities, I was interested to see which of the two I'd find better. Basically, in 19th Century London, famous magician Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) is on trial for the suspected murder of rival magician Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman), and through flashback we see how their story played out all the way to the trial. So Alfred and Robert were originally good friends working as magician assistants for performer Milton (Ricky Jay), and their engineer for all the tricks and illusions on stage was Cutter (Sir Michael Caine). Their friendship turns into strong rivalry between each other when Robert's wife Julia McCullough (Piper Perabo) is put in the glass box of water to perform the famous escape trick, but Alfred supposedly tied a different knot for her to untie, therefore Robert blames him for her death from drowning. Separately they both become magician performers with their own stage show acts, Borden calls himself The Professor, while Angier becomes The Great Danton, and trying to ruin each other's performance, and maybe get new ideas for astonishing acts, they both disguise themselves once or twice to do just this. Robert has a new wife Sarah (Rebecca Hall) who gives him a daughter, and he has Cutter and his new assistant Olivia Wenscombe (Scarlett Johansson), but he is looking for a new and revolutionary illusion. In disguise he attends the performance of his Rival, and he astonishes the audience with his new act, The Transported Man, and he wants to try and recreate the act, i.e. steal it, for himself, so Cutter finds him a very convincing lookalike to achieve this. But Robert wants to find out the real way to do the trick, or better create his own extraordinary alternative to it, and he finds that with some new technological marvel for real transportation, almost like teleportation. When he has perfected the act, and he knows Albert will be disguised in the audience and watching, that is when he lures him backstage to witness him fall through the trap door for the trick, and drown in the below water tank. That is how Albert is caught and imprisoned for the ""murder"", however he is shocked when he finds out that Robert is still alive, in disguise, and that he framed him. The film mentions the three important magic trick components: 1) the setup - show the something ordinary, 2) the performance, make something change, and 3) the prestige, bring the something back. The final shock of the film is not Robert being alive, but being killed by Albert, and the revelation that he has an identical twin brother, and that the real man is not the one in prison, oh, and that's how The Transported Man worked. Also starring Samantha Mahurin as Jess Borden, David Bowie as Tesla, Andy Serkis as Alley, Daniel Davis as Judge and Roger Rees as Owens. Jackman and Bale are equally matched as the mentally duelling magicians, Caine is really good as the man in amongst it all, Johansson gets her moments too, and the direction by Nolan is perfectly timed. The special effects for the magic is really good, the tricks themselves look as though they could be done for real, and the story is engaging, as for whether this is better than The Illusionist, it is, a terrific period mystery thriller. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction and Best Cinematography. Very good!"
" A Christopher Nolan Masterpiece.
",spoiler,"In the year 2000 Christopher Nolan directed what is now known as one of the most magnificent mystery movies of it's time in ""Memento."" So, coming into this movie, my expectations were off the chart. I can honestly say that they were fulfilled to the dot. The casting job couldn't get any better, every actor played his or her role to the fullest. Christian Bale yet again shows why he should be considered as an extravagant actor, with his role as a competitive magician without a show. Hugh Jackman shows how diverse his acting ability can really be. The role of the mentor/father figure is played by Michael Cane, and just like in previous movies he steals the stage every time his on screen. Scarlett Johansson just adds to that extra bonus of the star cast.It is very hard to put in words how unforgettable, touching, and mysterious the plot is. It shows exactly what a human being would do just to obtain the sense of greatness and power. The plot consists of twists, failure, deceptiveness, and the break of bonds. We observe as two great magicians go head to head to get to the top, and witness how they begin to forget what is truly important to them. They suffer the lost of love ones, friends, and most of all themselves. It's a heart breaking movie and through out the movie you have a hard time deciding whose side you are on, and who is at fault. Each magician has his flaws, and both commit something that changes how you feel about the character.The directing is of the movies is superior. Christopher Nolan is able to capture every emotion and action at it's best. The special effects were also spectacular, the tricks look amazing and feel believable, each trick was the perfect fit for the movie. The screenplay was a masterpiece by itself, and the scenery applied to it fit it exactly. There were no plot holes, and I never had to stop and wonder why a certain part occurred. This movie is definitely one of the best of all time, and it has been climbing up my ladder of my favorite movies of all time. It's a must see for everyone and that is the reason why gave this movie a 9/10."

" The Prestige Movie Review
",spoiler,"Are you watching closely? Are your really watching? That's all viewers can do as Director Christopher Nolan takes them into the illusive world of on stage magic, and the very battle unfolded by it's competitors. Robert Angier (Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Bale) are two stage magicians whose love for the very wonder of the art consumes their very souls, as both take each and every chance to crush the other. Secrets, secrets, and more secrets are revealed from both ends as the two risk life, and even their general morality to come out victorious. Robert, a magician with more showman ship to characterize his title, is consumed more and more with a determination to trounce Alfred, wanting to know every secret of his tricks. Obsession can cause so much damage to an individual, no matter what it is. In Roberts case, his need to succeed, will cost him the very thing a person cannot afford to lose, alive or dead, his soul. Borden on the other hand may not be as charismatic as the American gentleman, but with the natural talent he's been blessed with, it's enough to put a smile on his face, so long as he himself can live with secrets. Whether they're hidden from his family, or his enemies, one thing is for sure, secrets are what define this man, and what further drives Angier towards their competition. Their rivalry began in the wake of Roberts own loss, and what he believed to be Borden's own doing, thus fueling their competition to a more personal level, despite the cost of Borden's fingers for Angier's wife. Alas, the loss of the very woman Angier once loved will no longer torment him, and not at the soft lips of his new beloved Olivia (Johansson), but at the lingering desire to emerge as the victor of this battle. Deception becomes the main theme of this game between the two artists, as they play their cards as cautiously as possible, risking life, reputation, and their own humanity as they further and further get their hands dirty. Angier's need to win, escalates into a 2 year journey that further takes him into the dark world of real magic, the kind of magic that brings people surprise, but further misery as the secrets of that dark nature consume those people. The warnings from the already stained Nikola Tesla (Bowie) were not enough to drive Robert off this very corrupt path. His long stay in Colorado Springs turns out more than what he bargained for, as Angier obtains a device capable of breaking through the illusions and the practicality of stage magic. It's all revealed moments after his death, and within moments of Borden's false conviction. The magic of Angier's triumph over Borden does not stop at his mere sacrifice, oh no. It goes further into revealing the dark secrets of that a very machine. The man declared to be the deceased Robert Angier, was merely a double at the expense of the real Robert's or, Lord Caldlow's expense, as well as his further gain. Borden's only child Jess seemed like the proper bargaining ticket for his tricks and their detailed secrets. Unfortunately the deal is easily broken at the very arrogance of Robert's assured victory, tearing the notes into shreds, merely complimenting his own talent over Borden's as if Borden's sentence or even the very wellbeing of his own child in his tainted hands isn't enough to satisfy him. ""Abara Kadabra"", the common words of any magician are uttered from Borden as his neck breaks and his life ends, leaving this world with one last trick, and one more valuable than the mystery of the transported man. Fallon, Borden's seemingly quite manager, going the whole film without saying 2 words, ends it all with the end of the soulless Robert Angier. It's a climatic conclusion, as it not only ends the film with a terrific twist, but shows Christopher Nolan's dedication to the title of his film. Alfred's twin, capable of playing both parts alongside him, showed the nature as well as the very cost of their good tricks, indulging everyone, friends and enemies in a sense of never ending doubt, curiosity, and even mind wrenching madness that drove one to tainting his soul for the worst, and the other towards the end of her own taken life. Some viewers will believe that the idea of creating a twin brother for a character as deceptive and intelligent as Borden is cheap, but I see it as more of an opportunity to manipulate the nature of this film's theme. ""The Prestige"" revolves around magic, but it deeply explores the factors of the competition between its 2 characters Borden and Angier, and just how far each one went when trying to learn the other's secrets. Borden is a unique character because he lives in the moment of his magic, remaining dedicated to it, despite its heavy costs, while Robert displays the grasp obsession had on him, as his need to defeat Borden clouded his judgment as well as his very purpose for magic. Borden could enjoy the thrill and wonder of his magic, despite the competition he had indulged in himself. Angier, had no limits, he would no longer fear very evil he had done to continue, murder, abduction, and even acts that play the very noble work of God. The films overall them of limits in the nature of rivalry are what truly motivate these characters, and their very persona's, and that mostly what I enjoyed about this film. The direction of the film, as well how certain events in the film are displayed in the pattern of a magic trick. We viewers are each given a pledge and a turn, but the prestige for each one revealed is at a later time, surprising us to the very talent Chris Nolan has shown with both this ecstatic cast and the interesting subjects of obsession and competition."
" One of my All time Favorite Movie
",,A film for not everyone A film just for true cinema lovers. Great Cast Great Acting Great Direction Great sound Great Editing Great End Everything in this movie seems perfect. A film which is worth keeping a film to watch again and again. Today's most lovable actors in this movie made it a treat to watch. it has the story which will keep you edge of your seats all the time and will make you keep guessing what gonna next happen.Nolan is one of my favorite director who's movie i always love to watch without any second thought.Because i always know there gonna something new in his movies.Highly Recommended of ALL.. Don't miss it.
" How do you make a serious movie about magick? Trick question. You don't.
",spoiler,"For me, if the story is good, or at least believable, the script decent and the actors/actresses know their trade, then all that is required from the director - of not *ucking it up - is to just follow the script.Everything else is more or less masturbation with the aesthetics. Granted, if the form is fitting, we'll probably like it even better. Still, if you manage those three things, it should work even without a music or a set to speak of (à la ""Dogville"").While Nolan's story in interesting, it fails to be believable in the end.Nolan loves movies with a twist. And honestly, who doesn't? The problem is, such movies really only work once.I can't help but feel that movies like ""The Prestige"", ""The Sixth Sense"", and so on, are little more than a waste of perfectly good celluloid... In retrospect (at the very least), one always has to shake her head in disbelief. To insist that Bruce Willis - or anyone else for that matter - could go on living a day without realizing that he is actually dead, is an insult to our intellect. You wouldn't need to plss or shlt anymore? Go shopping for food? You wouldn't notice people walking right through you on the streets?There are some exceptions. ""The Blair Witch Project"" was kinda fun to watch again because it has that real-life documentary feel to it. The trio's reactions/emotions ring so true. The scene where one of them confesses that he ditched the map in frustration, is timeless.But back to Nolan.I liked the mood he created in ""Insomnia"", even if that may have had more to do with solid performances given by Williams and Pacino - and the midnight Sun.My memories about ""Memento"" have grown vague, but I do remember enjoying it all those years ago. Don't know how I would feel about it today, though.But you'd figure if a movie is any good, you'd remember it, right?Still, ""Memento"" is the only Nolan movie I've cared to watch again. ""Batman Begins"" had absolutely nothing to remember it by. But it probably looked really cool. I don't think any director would be pleased hearing comments like these.Even though I haven't seen ""Inception"" or ""The Dark Knight"", I fear neither of them will make me really appreciate Nolan as a director who has something worthwhile to say. And if South Park's ""Insheeption"" is anything to go by, it's safe to assume that his notion of great cinema probably differs from mine on some crucial level.""The Prestige"", of course, had it's moments, but for me it failed for a couple of reasons. First, I couldn't really bring myself to care much about any of the main characters. I fear Bale is more or less Keanu Reeves 2.0 and Scarlett Johansson is just a poor man's Kate Winslet.There, I said it.Worse than that, when a walk-on (Bowie, whom I did not recognize) is far more interesting than anything else in the movie, you know someone blew it royally.And second, to wrap it up with something as inane as cloning is just bad writing. So, instead of leaving us with a lingering feeling of mystery, we're simply ordered to eat up this poor excuse for a science fiction and asked to feel satisfied about it nonetheless.I think ""The Prestige"" wants itself taken far too seriously. All in all it's a good fun ride, just not all the way. A ride I don't feel like repeating.PS. For the record, and since _everyone_ compares these two, I cared immensely more about the characters in ""The Illusionist"", and the ending was much more satisfying, too: you could either reason it, or you could just believe there's some magic after all... Nothing else to it for a mission accomplished.PS2. And Nolan, if you really want to tell us a story about Tesla, feel free to do so. We have your interest, and we have an actor for the part as well."
" No Spoiler
",,"This was the only movie of Christopher Nolan which was yet to watch for me.. It's a wonderful movie.. Though it's rated below Nolan's some other works, but i find it really good, as good as the likes of dark knight and inception if not better .The movie revolves around the rivalry between two magician , set upon nineteenth century, Nolan shown that era quite wonderfully ..And like almost all Nolan movies, it has an mind jolting ending. and so many twists and turns :)Performance is eqaully good from both hugh jackman and Christian bale as the two rival magician. And the ladies haven't got much to do but rebecca hall and scarlett johansson does well .. and o'course michael caine , as always in all the Nolan movies (batman series and inception) excelled in his small but significant role. lastly i just wanna say ""Are u watching Closely? "" ;)"
" A True Cinematic Experience; A Perfect Masterpice
",spoiler,"Few movies are on the same visceral level as Christopher Nolan's ""The Prestige"". Most movies and film directors allow their actors (uusualy A-List Stars) take over their films making story an afterthought. However I applaud Nolan for while letting his actors do their best and truly achieve superb acting, he keeps them at bay, making the overall experience more complete. All the actors still truly shine here with Hugh Jackman giving a standout performance as a conflicted, obsessive man who is brilliant and mad at the same time. He is sharp, dramatic, and fulfilling and I hope he does more roles like this rather than playing Wolverine in X-Men. Christian Bale matches him very well as the sly, creepy, but perhaps a little more lighter character than Jackman's giving the film more balance. Michael Caine delivers a top-notch performance as is expected and Rebecca Hall and Scarlett Johansenn are quite good as well making a superb ensemble cast.Now as for the much talked about plot, this is where the film truly shines. The plot, like most of Nolan's films it told while randomly switching through different time-lines but it always very clear when we are in the storyline and each time we switch back to a new time we gain more insight and exposition making the main storyline an exciting puzzle to piece together. The twists and surprises are plentiful and varied, all perfectly revealed and perhaps very smartly reserved for different points during the film. For example forty minutes through the film we have one plot twist, ten minutes later we have another, fifteen minutes later we have another, and Nolan keeps the best for last delivering the last plot twist in the final minutes or so crowning the film with a true prestige. One of The greatest things about this plot and Nolan Films in general is that they are visually and mentally stimulating at the same time proving that big-budget films with Hollywood actors can be smart and entertaining. Also along with the main plot there is a minor sub-plot of the romance between Bale's character and the two female leads which turns to be tragic and heart-breaking and giving this very stylish film an emotional core.The last thing i can say about this film is the atmosphere. ""The Prestige"" is most likely one of the most atmospheric films ever made and this in equal part to the haunting score and the hypnotic cinematography courtesy of Nolan standby Wally Pfister. The score firstly has often been criticized at being too simple and not being able to stand on its own without the film. But that's the Point! For some strange reason people expect that they can listen to an original score that was meant to be part of a complex plot and paired with cinematic ambiance and still enjoy it. However this score was rightfully designed to be an integral part of a perfect whole.Pfister's Cinematography is breathtaking making each frame evocative in its own right, and gradually brings you intimately close with the characters and the wonderful period sets.If there's one thing I need to warn you about this film is the suspense. I found myself having trouble breathing during some scenes due to anticipation or terror and throughout the film i could not tear my eyes away from the screen. The film is highly addictive and engrossing. Nolan rivals Hitchcock in terms of mastery of suspense. Be warned though, this film is dark and depressing. One thing Nolan could have done was adding some sort of comic relief. Notwithstanding this a superb film and is among the best films ever made and rightfully deserves your attention. :)"
" I DID watch closely....
",spoiler,"...that's why I saw - yes, actually saw - that Fallon was a twin...geez, why couldn't he tell his wife (whoever's...;-))? ...that's why I was reminded again why I don't like ""magic"" tricks at all, never have....give me some Hogwarts magic instead anytime! Or real science fiction.This could have stayed in the real world with maybe using the lookalike and then killing HIM off as revenge - but no, they had to make poor Nicola Tesla into something he was not...Nice cinematography, and I happen to like Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman (and Michael Caine of course, THAT goes without saying...check out Harry Brown!), and I think Rebecca Hale is sooo much the better actress than Scarlett Johanssen, so I was entertained, but not really fooled...no, I did not see everything coming, but the main points --- the diary stunt was actually a smooth one! One of the best films I've ever seen? Hardly. Not much substance imho, really good films have an impact on your life, you take something home from them.This one just leaves me with the image of a squashed bird...and that was only the first of a number of superfluous deaths..."
" Are You Watching closely
",,"This ones from my favourite director and is a a masterpiece. Great story,great writing,dialogues,throw in wonderful performance by top of the league actors,suspense,thrill and the WORLD OF MAGIC AND MAGICIANS and you have an excellent movie. went beyond my expectations.One of those rare movie where you would love to cling onto every word uttered and every dialogue spoken which in themselves have very deep meaning(something similar to THE DARK KNIGHT).and if will watch it you wont be disappointed. Only the question is:ARE YOU WATCHING CLOSELY??9.8/10"
" (Magic) Layers
",,"I really don't know where to start. The great production design, the fabulous acting, the great cinematography, the superb writing, the awesome directing ... I really don't know. But I do know, that this is another Nolan movie. Which kinda is a trademark or became one for me. That is why the number one movie I was looking forward in 2010, was ""Inception"".But I will get into that other movie on its own page. If you haven't watched any Christopher Nolan movie yet ... well it's almost not possible. Even if you got away from all the buzz Memento created, it's almost impossible, that you haven't seen at least one of the Batman movies he made. Then again you might not be into that sort of movies. And that's the great thing about Nolan. Making entertaining movies, that have substance.Maybe Insomnia is his ""weakest"" movie (if you count the reception it got) and ""Following"" was just a student film, but even those two are a showcase of his talent. But then again, I might be just a fan-boy drooling about achievements that you think are not worthy mentioning. You have to make up your own mind ... start with this mind-boggling or with any other of his movies ... Repeated viewing is almost necessary! And you will most likely want to anyway!"
" Full of wit, intellect and gripping moments....
",,"""There are 3 parts to a trick...."" Full of wit, intellect and gripping moments, The Prestige is a splendid watch.Ever since I watched Memento, I've always admired the prowess of Nolan and watched most of his films(Batman series, Inception). This was a movie that was on my watch list for quite sometime now. I'm glad I watched it.If Memento was a cerebral adventure, in this movie, Nolan tries to create an era bygone to tell a masterfully crafted narrative. Some distant reflections of Amadeus/Othello, the story adapted from a novel is original indeed. The director explores the magicians' battle for survival in a world that rewards only the best. In an attempt to overpower the other, they lose their emotions, morale and mind. The good and the evil are separated by a thin line....Of the performances, both Hugh Grant and Christiane Bale deserve tremendous credit. Its a performance that's hard to chose between just same as that of Cage and Travolta in Face-off. Michael Caine is superb in his role once again and brings in authenticity & respect to his character. As his trademark in many movies, Nolan keeps the best for the last. Though you had enough clues, you'd never guess the climax. A simple yet riveting climax that will surely mesmerize you.Christopher Nolan started shooting with his dad's camera at the age of 7 and made his first movie at just 27. Easily, my director of the last decade. With the kind of cinema he's making, he would soon be a legend - the likes of Scorcesse. Looking forward to see the next Batman adventure in which I'm sure we'll see another legendary character 'The Riddler' panning out.Prestige done. ""Following"" next; Nolan's debut movie :-)"
" Strange, good, mysterious and very imposing.......
",,"Although initially confusing and mysterious once you think about it (and maybe do some wider research of the plot) then you start to piece together the narrative of the film and you realise what Christopher Nolan wanted to portray with the very imposing last shot. The character development is brilliant as you don't know which side to be on as they are both flawed in their own way. A very complex but clever and unique narrative which is to be appreciated once you fully get it. Great cinematography and art direction, very imposing as your mind still keeps unravelling what you have just seen but you still love it. Amazing performances by Hugh Jackman, Christian Bale, Michael Caine and the rest of the cast. Christopher Nolan is no doubt a very artistic and creative director. Worth the watch"
" Interesting but confusing
",,"The film is great. I mean it has interesting plot, some action etc. BUT look at the actors. OK, they are not ""the same"" people, but with fake beards, hats and stupid cloth it is nearly impossible to understand who is on the screen now. Plus the plot is not chronological, so at the end of the movie you simply do not understand the reasons of what is going on. Who wants revenge, who does not, what does the other guy want!? This is the reason nowadays if there are 2 main characters in the movie one of the is white and the over is black. Because you do not get confused who is who!!! But com on, if you want to make two white actors make of them blond and the other brunet."
" Good movie
",,"I'd have given it a 9, but I gave it an 8 because of the lack of the climax. It was a good movie; very good,I'd say. But I can't seem to find out what moment is the peak of the action. It's all too flat; not insipid-but flat.Now that I've mentioned the only problem this movie has, the good parts:Interesting mix of history and magic. It successfully recreates the XIX century atmosphere; not like a glance of the past though, but like a glance of another dimension. And this maybe because of the fact that -unlike other magic-based plots- it let's you take a look at the methods they use, it let's you see the magicians world not as an intruder, but as if being one of them."
" No illusions as Nolan's piece hits the mark
",spoiler,"The Prestige is a unique thriller that works very well thanks to the slick direction of Christopher Nolan and a terrific contribution by a stellar cast. A movie that revolves around the acts of Victorian magicians is perhaps not at first glance the most obvious backdrop to set the story to, but Nolan delivers a powerful, engaging and compelling piece that is thoroughly enjoyable. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale play two rival magicians, who through fate and tragedy, become competitively obsessed with the success of each others' acts. The sense of illusion is perfectly pitched throughout by Nolan, and it even gives the audience a wide appreciation of the world of magic (one almost can't wait to get home a try a few card tricks!). Jackman and Bale are magnificent, and are ably supported by the usual brilliance from Michael Caine. Quite how David Bowie pops up is anyones guess, but the whole movie is well made and will rightly be regarded in years to come as a superior picture."
" Good? no, GREAT !
",,"It's a twisted complicated not-short movie ! that gets all of your five senses! from its very first moment to its amazing unexpected ending! i must say, both the actors did a great believable job, and boredom becomes impossible while watching this masterpiece. the directing was great, the acting, and most importantly the twist in the end. movies like the prestige mostly are the kind that you watch for just once for some reason, the ones that you watch for more than once are those simple happy movies, or Disney movies, yet, for some reason, I tend to enjoy the prestige every time it's on TV, great much? INDEED! if you haven't gotten the chance to watch this masterpiece yet, go for it!"
" The Pledge. The Turn. THE PRESTIGE.
",,"In an era where most human perception was still inferior to the magic of the lightest human tricks, comes a montage of amazement from the blinded audience.It's also the applause, the acceptance, the stunned audience's hunger for curiosity why these self proclaimed magicians thrive in an environment where your name is only as good as your last show.It is for this same reason why rivalry emanates among them. They study, they search and drools for the required learning to ecstatically shout that they own that next best kept secret in town. For what? For The Pledge, The Turn and The Prestige.The Prestige is an enigmatic film. It's smart, that you can fall for its conundrum or choose to just wait as a patient spectator. Or, you can even be smart enough to just open your eyes, as the film quotation tells us, ""Are you watching closely?"" If appropriate praises are needed for cleverly making this film, then I would simply give it hands own to, Christopher and Jonathan Nolan for the FANTASTIC screenplay, the great editors of this film for expertly putting this puzzle in one piece and off course, to the person who started it all, Christopher Priest.And for the cast, to me they are sort of pieces of puzzle that incredibly fit to fill every space in the story board, Good job.I won't dare to give any detail from any act in this film. It's better to watch it with a sense of urgency to literally look out for the answer like every magician's audience does. After all, the same enlightenment we get from any magic does not differ from any. We learn it is always about detail.It's safe to say, that this Nolan's masterpiece is centered about magic but is never entirely about it. The film's depth is about human ""ambition"". Frailty as an effect of the consequences following that bold dream and is subsequent when be fallen to an obsession. But it is also that human ""will"" that won't stop us chasing it. For every little inch we grasp by reaching it fascinates us, wanting more. And for what Again? The Prestige."
" AMAZING movie
",spoiler,"This is by far one of my favorite movies. One of few movies I consider to be artwork. It is truly a masterpiece of a movie. It is suspenseful, mind-boggling, intellectual, and humorous and action-filled at times.I have watched this movie about four times now, and every time I watch it I pick up on things that escaped me the previous time. This movie has an ability to dazzle and entertain, which is essential for a movie, while also providing the audience with serious food for thought.The Prestige is well researched and surprisingly believable too. It has a sci-fi twist that plays well with the plot. At first when I learned of the sci-fi component I scoffed at it, believing it to be a misplacement of something better off in a James Cameron film. As it turned out I was completely wrong. It fit right in, as a mater of fact it was essential, to the plot. Whether the science of the device is believable or not can be discarded. The movie is based on the moral repercussions that result from using the device more than the device itself.Speaking of moral repercussions, there are so many thought-provoking moral questions in this movie that it's a wonder they fit them all in!This is a wonderful movie. I suggest that anyone who can loose a night of sleep over it should watch it. You'll stay up pondering the plot, the morals, the 'what ifs,' basically the whole movie itself! Definitely worth a watch, or two, or three...."
" the major logic flaw that isn't addressed in anywhere
",spoiler,"***** contains spoiler ********as the logic flaw is with the plot. Rupert Angier and Alfred Borden both had versions of the transported man. i don't see how one magician used his double over and over in the same trick, but the other didn't use his double. geez, could have had triples with his duplicator. why kill the original or the copy ? it was pointless, when they could just put on a show like the other.if i'm not making myself clear, watch the movie, then read this. i'm not saying the logic flaws the movie. no. it's a great movie. it's well done, per all the other reviews. what i'm saying is that it isn't logical to kill a double or triple. a magician could have a really good show with five or ten or a hundred copies of himself without having to get rid of the originals."
" Battle of the Magicians
",,"Nolan's 'The Prestige' is full of magic and surprises. Based on Christopher Priest's absorbing novel, Nolan brings it to life on screen. The story develops from interesting premise about two magicians, who were once friends, now turned into rivals. But the strength of the storytelling lies in how the events unfold with its twists and turns, keeping the viewer in sheer suspense and wonder while at the same time never losing its main focus. The director has an eye for visuals and almost each and every frame of the movie is very intricately detailed. The film is set during some time in the Victorian era but I liked that it still felt contemporary rather than a period piece. Yet, that is not to say that the art direction does not deserve mention. Quite the contrary because toning it down had a brilliantly subtle effect. Likewise, the cinematography too is effectively downplayed. The score flows smoothly. Hugh Jackman delivers one of his best works to date. The actor is simply excellent as the caring and easy-going turned into ambitious, competitive and vengeful magician. Christian Bale too is impressive while Michael Caine almost always knows how to deliver a memorable performance and here he's no different. Scarlett Johanssen is quite forgettable while Rebecca Hall fairs better and Piper Perabo shines in a small role. 'The Prestige' is one of Nolan's best (along with his debut 'Memento') movies. Not only because it's spectacular to look at but it has all that I look for in a movie experience."
" One of Nolan's and Bale's most prestigious films which proves gripping and enthralling
",,"If any director could make a film about two rival magicians who compete for a few tricks to bedazzle against each other at every prospect, then Christopher Nolan has definitely proved the man for the job. His almost trademark nonlinear narrative structure is as far from hackneyed as Christian Bale is having an angry outburst at the director of photography on a film (oops sorry about that Christian).Robert and Alfred - Bale and Jackman are two manic, manipulative magicians (like what I did with the m's there?) whose obsession with trickery and determination to be the best of the best plays a huge motivation for The Prestige. And it is all cleverly manifests by all the intervening past scenes that show how the smallest details became significant to the present day plot where our story begins; but by present day I mean early 20th century.So with these flashbacks you can expect plenty of 'Ahhhh I see how they did that' moments and a plot with so many layers it will match your homemade birthday cake. But Nolan can't receive all the credit for what makes this film so riveting. The rivalry between Bale and Jackman is intense and real sense of history and abhorrence is among them, so much so that it feels like World War three could break out at any moment. Scarlett Johansson though slightly underused for such a talented actress provides numerous ardent scenes between the main leads and shows she isn't just someone to ogle at in a corset - no complaints about that though.On this form Nolan's Inception should be a blast which The Prestige will no doubt wet your appetite for and give you a reason to watch over and over again not that one is needed anyway."
" A wonderful film--also see the Ilusionist
",,"http://mix.dailyevergreen.com/index.php?aid=29302 ""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" were both phenomenal movies that received far less attention than they deserved. They made magic cool again, yet two blockbuster magic movies in one year may have canceled each other out. If you haven't seen these movies, I highly recommend renting or buying them.Michael Caine's character in ""The Prestige"" explains that every great magic trick consists of three parts.""The first part is called 'The Pledge.' The magician shows you something ordinary. The second act is called 'The Turn' – the magician takes the ordinary something and makes it do something extraordinary,"" his character says. ""But you wouldn't clap yet. Because making something disappear isn't enough, you have to bring it back. That's why every magic trick has a third act, the hardest part, the part we call 'The Prestige.'"" That is essentially what both movies are – great big magic tricks that will keep you guessing throughout the films. There are times during the movies where things get a bit slow, just like any magic trick, but the payoff at the end. The prestige is always worth it. As usual, Christopher Nolan (The Dark Knight) does a near flawless directing job in ""The Prestige."" Two magicians, who begin as colleagues, become rivals after a tragedy. Their obsession with each other grows darker and more extreme as the film progresses. Hugh Jackman (X-Men, Wolverine) gives a great performance and creates the haunted charismatic Rupert Angier. Christian Bale (The Dark Knight, Batman) plays Alfred Borden the silent brooder. Acting all-star Michael Caine rounds out the trio as the experienced sage wise man caught in the middle.On the other hand, ""The Illusionist"" focuses on a different obsession – forbidden love.Edward Norton (Fight Club) is brilliant in his leading role as the mysterious Eizenheim the Illusionist. Despite my initial doubts, Jessica Biel (Seventh Heaven) gives a surprisingly solid performance as Norton's love interest, the Duchess Sophie. The chemistry between the two is very believable.The conflict arises on several fronts. The Crown Prince already has plans to make Sophie his wife and grows enraged at her denial due to her feelings for the Illusionist. Paul Giamatti steals the show as Inspector Uhl, the man chosen by the Prince to shut Eisenheim down. His performance as a man torn between his duty and his own fascination of the Illusionist's many tricks is wonderful to watch.""The Prestige"" is the better film. It had superb directing and a better plot. Yet at the same time, ""The Illusionist"" was a more enjoyable film experience. Giamatti and Norton rival Caine, and they completely outclass Bale and Jackman. ""The Prestige"" is dark, and for some, perhaps too dark. The magicians are so unlikeable at times that it is easy to stop caring about what happens to them anymore. ""The Illusionist"" has better pacing than ""The Prestige"" and doesn't veer into the absurd and unlikely.Both movies are fantastic and either one is worth multiple viewings. They are similar but also very different. It just depends on the individual as to which one is better. However, both will make you believe in magic."
" Very entertaining
",,"The Prestige tells the story of two rival magicians in the nineteenth century,Alfred Borden(Christian Bale) and Robert Angier(Hugh Jackman). Before becoming rivals they worked together for a magician but one night Angier's wife died performing one of the tricks and Angier blamed Borden. From that point on both individuals become accomplished and successful magicians and trough the years they try to steal each other tricks often interfering with one another shows.They get more obsessed, more envious and end up playing a very dangerous game...I found The Prestige to be a highly entertaining film. The magicians obsession in topping one another and the extreme lengths they go to do so, make this rivalry very interesting to watch.The story is full of twists and turns,most of them unexpected.Both Jackman and Bale delivered good performances and the movie was well directed.Near the end answers are provided to the two biggest secrets in the movie but they might not please everyone.I guessed one of the answers but the other one, I never saw it coming and some might feel cheated. Also it might not seem that way but this is a very complex movie and after watching it you should read the faq on the movie page.8/10"
" Magical.......Truly Magical
",spoiler,"Watched this movie for the second time and loved it even more. Based in England at the beginning of the 19th century, The basic plot revolves around two rival magicians Alfred Borden and Robert Angier played by Bale and Jackman respectively who crave to outdo each others magic tricks and in this endeavor face very tragic results or ends. The basic plot itself is very interesting and when we have the great non-linear narration style of Nolan attached to it, it becomes even more pleasing and extraordinary as an overall piece of art.This movie also has many twists and turns which will challenge the viewer and keep him engaged and shocked until the end credits . The movie contains disguises, look-alikes, betrayals, magic meets science and the overall different layers of human natureThe two lead actors have done a tremendous job, so much so that I cannot make out who outdid whom in acting. The actresses Scarlett and Rebecca have played their part well. A special mention goes to the legendary actor Michael Caine who plays his supporting role in the best possible way. Overall, surely this movie makes it to the top 3 movies of Nolan until nowRating : 8/10"
" A movie that keeps you hooked to your seat till the last minute.
",,"This movie was quite different from the kinds Hollywood is making all these days. First things First, it was quite a confusing at the start. but each and every minute of this will be worth watching after you reach the end of this movie. the cast was very cleverly selected and the best part of this was the fusion of conventional magic with the science. the best part of this movie was of course it's PRESTIGE, the term coined by magicians for the ending of any trick. every minute of this drama is put down in black and white towards the last 10 minutes of the movie. the twins, the fingers been cut, generation of clones through TESLA's machine, killing the original performer every night. it was fun watching this. overall i would rate this movie at 8.5/10. well a deduction of 1.5 points because there were some things which could have been less complicated."
" The prestige is when conscious awaken folks minds!
",spoiler,"The Prestige, is a compelling masterpiece that deliberate and argue the relation between superpowers: Ex Imperial UK, Newly forming EU, and the ageing universal superpower, The US. This beautiful brain-oriented and highly written with mastery novel by Christopher Priest and the adaptation of The Nolan\\'s, is really one of the best ever produced picture motions, right beside The Cinderella Man, and Vendetta! Yet each phrase and sentence of the dialogue between the characters say it into our faces, especially, the shocking ""Are you watching closely?"" The director and writer tell us it is our freedom have been manipulated by Lords! It is when all the ladies ""The Nation"" asks to stop lies and throw it into their faces ""Both of you deserve each other""! It is when arrogance of the Twins take it to the high risk and tie the wrong knot! It is the Nuke devastating and peaceful double nature represented by ""Tesla\\'s terrifying alternating current"". It is when Caine can NOT follow the obsession of the new imperialism, it is when the intelligence twist facts and when rivalling between superpowers brakes bones of Angiers, and torn Bordon\\'s fingers, leaving both injured but NOT disabled. It is when the power leave to the new land the US. It is when citizens being fooled by their governments. This is a true cinema and one of the best that will last in history. Caine\\'s one of his best, when the conscience decided at the end to rectify a wrong decision, when the future is on the edge ""Jaycee!"" When obsession of abusing science and its power weapons could NOT be limited to only 100 times! The dialogue between: The Nations (Ladies), Governments (Angiers! & Bordons!), Lords (Cutter!), Capitalism (theatre owners and financiers), Citizens (audiences of theatre shows), Justice (compromising on trading a secret against the condemning of the government). Every and each name of the characters was highly picked, it is a masterpiece of course! Thanks to everyone participated to this work."
" A cool movie
",,"A cool movie that has a really good ending.Directed by the same director as The Dark Knight, I enjoyed this much better.The cast was great and the costumes were really done well.For a movie all about English people, most of it was filmed in L.A., in a warehouse or on a stage - which looks really cool.The set design is what impressed me the most. The entire film had to be done in late 1800 time period and looked like the real deal.It shows a few magic trick secrets that are nice to know.The entire film was just great from start to finish."
" Stunning film that questions the reality of the mysterious art
",,"Working in the magic industry has turned Alfred (Bale) and Angier (Jackman) into bitter enemies that are threatening their professional and personal lives.With J.K Rowling's unbelievable success the answer to magic is simply Harry Potter. And though the films are undoubtedly good hearted and entertainment at its highest standard they do not look at the complexity and creativity of the world of magic and the power it can truly have, whereas Christopher Nolan's picture explores that gritty depth and delivers a bitter reality about the world of magicians.Magicians, with the exception of the Harry Potter franchise, are stereotyped in a disastrous way in most modern films. The silly hats the awkward dialogue and the cringing costume designs make the concept of magic seem equally ridiculous but The Prestige looks at the inner torment of a magician and add a special something to a figure that was apparently dead.Bale and Jackman deliver knockout performances. Bale particularly shines with a hard and truthful approach to his character. Both actors are helped along by a finely scripted narrative that challenges the magician stereotype and questions the existence of magic.The film isn't afraid to admit that magic is all a trick but takes a brave step to demonstrate the tactical approach of the mysterious art.The Pledge, The Turn and The Prestige help invite audiences into that world and though designed to entertain, feels slightly educational as an added bonus. You will be tempted to have a try at magic once this film reaches its closure, which is a heap of questions in itself.Filled with twists, turns, flashbacks and futuristic views, The Prestige grabs the concept of magic and puts a bitter spin on it using these devices to tremendous effect. The ending raises many eyebrows and is a marvellous question raiser that will require another watch that will no be hesitated.Nolan's artistic direction from Memento and Batman Begins is present in this Oscar nominated drama. His close and careful shots feel free and exquisite against an artistic backdrop. The setting of the story feels special and appreciative, a time when people could recognize the surprising element that is magic.The prestige is a fine mystery drama that questions the existence of magic through its forever twisting narrative."
" Nolan at his best
",,"I am a huge fan of Christopher Nolan.The climax of the film is far too awesome and well directed.I wonder if the movie is so good, then what about the novel? Both Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale have done an extremely terrific job.The magic sequences were very well executed and the secrets were an eye-opener. It surely is the best movie of 2006.The depiction of rivalry between the two magicians is very well portrayed and Bale's comic act is the high point of the film.In fact there are many high points, but i guess this was a cut above the rest.Also the opening and closing narration regarding ""the prestige"" is very beautifully penned and I keep repeating it in my mind.Nolan is GOD!"
" Great performance from the two leads but not a great film
",,Both Jackman and Bale are excellent in this film and the sets and camera work are also really good. Petty quibbles would be yet another rubbish performance from David Bowie as a scientist and the boring choice of Micheal Caine for the character Cutter.This aside my main reason for ending up a bit disappointed with The Prestige was that I saw the end coming about 30 minutes into the film. I can't say I'm the most astute at spotting endings and it's not something I concentrate on when watching films either so I reckon the film just made it too easy.Still worth a look for the beautiful production and for the main performances.
" Mad Scientists/Mad Magicians
",spoiler,"Starting with when the movies first got sound, for several decades there was a genre of semi/horror films that's usually called ""The Mad Scientist."" Boris Karloff did wonderful work in some, and other actors shone as well.Basically a scientist in his obsession to learn the secret of life, death, the universe, or whatever and sacrifices his honor, his reputation, his morality, his sanity, not to mention his family, friends, and assorted innocent bystanders while he pursues his obsession.Well THE PRESTIGE takes this attitude and applies it sort of to magicians. It works, but the story adds more twists, reversals, and ambiguities than were seen in most of those horror movies. Among them being the stunning work of David Bowie as a scientist who is extremely sympathetic and warns of the dangers of obsession.Anyway it's a well made, well acted film, that if it suits your taste you may want to watch several times to fathom all the twists of character and plot.Oh, another usual character in those old movies was a sweet, innocent, beautiful young woman. There are a couple of such characters here but they have their twists as well. And near the end of the film, when we're in the underground cellar and the camera pulls back to show all the tanks, I kind of missed that piercing scream of horror that the young female usually gave out at such a moment in the golden oldies."
" Smoke and mirrors
",spoiler,"Engaging, engrossing but in the end, for me, confusing movie helmed by dark mystery purveyor extraordinaire Christopher Nolan. The movie plays like a magicians' version of ""The Duellists"", with Jackman and Bale vying to pull off the perfect disappearing act on the Edwardian stage. To make such a thin premise the basis for a whole movie takes some doing and it's to Nolan's credit that he pretty much pulls it off. I did find the constant change of narrative perspective somewhat confusing and the ""reveal"" at the end far fetched to say the least (unless I'm wrong Bale's disappearing device is actually a duplicating or cloning machine, with the doppelganger dying every night) but the journey along the way is well purveyed, helped by a stellar cast on good form. Michael Caine as elder statesman and lead narrator holds the story together, the stunts are effectively conveyed and throughout the dark cinematography holds your attention. As I stated above though, the implausibility of the piece ultimately detracts from the end result. Derren Brown does it better on TV!"
" Not expecting a great stuff, I was not disappointed.
",,"Not expecting a great stuff, I was not disappointed.Like the Illusionist (same year), this is not one I did like a lot.One month separated the public coming out of these movies Once seen, is enough... (I even preferred the Illusionist, though in it the acting was like a tasteless menu)Yes, the Prestige's acting and cast is much better than in The Illusionist, and the machinery is interesting, but for me, the supposed magic didn't work.Good acting and decorum seldom save a whole movie...The script is too complicated, and twisting a lot for an poor result...Not very funny, insisting on special effect...In fact what I appreciated was the acting as i wrote before, good if not top notch...The rest: ""bof"" ... the french interjection perfectly describe my appreciation!So, the same year, with an interval of a month, two ""magic films"" came out, at least for me (knowing the IMDb voters top marks for both!) for a so-so result : it must be the law of series...Fortunately, after expecting much pleasure from the Illusionist, and in fact was just a passable OK saying, for this one my hopes were lowered : it corresponded to what I got..."
" confusing ending, supernatural elements should never have been used
",,"I liked how this film shows you how some of the magic tricks are performed. It doesn't try to make the magicians look like warlocks. The centerpoint of the film is the dark rivalry between Angier and Borden. Angier blames Borden for the death of his wife during a magic trick and they become enemies. They try to one up each other. Angier is obsessed over Borden's Teleported Man trick. He must find out how it is done. He gets a new assistant that he falls for but sends her to Borden to discover the secret. However, she falls for Borden and this cause's Borden's wife to commit suicide. Angier goes to see a scientist and he invents a cloning box using electricity. This is where the supernatural elements come into play. Through a series of events, Borden is accused of Angier's murder and is sentenced to die. But, is Angier really dead? What about Borden? What was the secret to the Teleported Man? All of these questions are answered in a confusing ending, but the cloning part still doesn't make complete sense to me.FINAL VERDICT: OK, but I though it was difficult to follow and plus a little to long. The film jumps around a timeline and you have to think about what time frame the film is in."
" A special thriller
",,The storyline is very tricky and you have to pay some attention here. It is a thriller from another view of dimension. I didn't see many of those films that have to do with illusions. My wife didn't like it because the time is set in the last century but I don't mind. So we had at the end of the movie mixed emotions and opinions. She gave a 3/10 and me a solid 7/10. I never got bored because the pace was rather fast and there were finally many surprisingly scenes till the end when I was impressed solving the enigmas. All the cast delivered a respectable performance and the director was very good after his disappointing Memento. I think for all these reasons the audience gets a very interesting show. Final vote is a solid 5/10. I am curious how will do the other THE ILLUSIONIST.
" This one frustrated me
",spoiler,"one of my sister's actually said that it was probably because I love Hugh Jackman so much that I couldn't bear to see him in such an obsessive state but I beg to differ. It was well shot, very imaginative and the actors were at the top of their game, I just really didn't like this film. The Prestige and The Illusionist both arrived at the box-office within months or maybe even weeks apart from one another and sort of K-Oed each other with their similar look and plot lines. I went to see The Prestige, thinking it would be the better movie because it seemed to have the better cast but I can confirm now that this was not the case. The tale within The Prestige dealt more with obsession, revenge and the darker side of the art of magic whereas The Illusionist dealt with romance, illusions and perhaps sweet revenge or shall I say karma.Anyways, since I'm reviewing The Prestige let me keep it at that. The film revolves around two rivaling magicians: Robert Angier (played by Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (played by Christian Bale). Upon the suspiciously accidental death Angier's wife Julia (played oddly by Piper Perabo) the tension between the two magicians not only intensifies (seeing how Borden was supposedly the one who tied the knot to the rope that killed Julia) it becomes a flat out tug-of-war. With Angier trying to find answers as to why his wife was killed and with Borden trying to avoid being murdered by his rival. Scarlett Johansson's Olivia shows up later to play the mediator between the two men but to no apparent avail. With either of the other trying to outdo the other with the latest magic tricks, the competition eventually turns into a fatally dangerous obsession. Michael Caine & David Bowie co-star."
" Not as good as it could get
",,"The movie has all the right ingredients for a good simmering thriller. Two magicians with their bag of tricks, motive for revenge, class actors in Caine, Jackman and Bale, and above all the genius of Christopher Nolan.However, at the end quite a few viewers may end up feeling a bit let down. Owing to Nolan's gift of offering an ingenious storyline with a twist at the ending, (Memento, Batman Begins), the expectations were always going to be very high. And indeed, the polished storytelling, the beautiful sets and the tight script all add up to a good package. But for people trying to figure out the movie, and guess the ending, most will feel a bit let down at the ease at which this is possible.The cast is nicely rounded out. The two magicians do a very good job, and are very well supported by Michael Caine. Scarlett Johansson has little screen time, but performs well. The film is undoubtedly good, but one gets the feeling it could have been much better."
" excellent...but not for me
",spoiler,"There might be something in here that spoils some element of the film-watching experience, so if you prefer to be completely and utterly shocked... don't read any further! The Prestige deserves a lot of recognition. The story was beautifully crafted: nothing was left unresolved and all of the resolutions made perfect sense. It's really a brilliant character study. The actors turned out phenomenal performances, as expected. Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman are amazing, and or course Michael Caine is awesome. The movie got me emotionally involved. The ending was... well, completely shocking! I found myself sucked in. My heart was pounding every time an illusion was about to happen. The sound mixing was a little off, but the cinematography more than makes up for it. I just... didn't like it. It's well thought out, but extremely depressing. I'm not one for revenge, so I hated that element. I tend to prefer films that leave some hope for human character, but this one really doesn't. All in all, it was an amazing film! It just was not my thing."
" The Prestige
",,"The Prestige is another example (as if one is needed) of director Christopher Nolan's talent behind the camera. Here he has crafted an intimate film that feels like a blockbuster with such a natural flair for solid storytelling that I would have no difficulties in saying that he is - despite only making a handful of films - one of, if not the, best British filmmaker around. The film concerns two magicians in turn-of-the-century London. Alfred Borden (Bale) is on trial for the murder of Robert Angier (Jackman), and the film slowly unravels the story of Borden's and Angier's friendship that, after a tragic accident that leaves Angier's wife dead, turns into a bitter rivalry. When Angier sees a trick of Borden's that he describes as ""the best magic trick I have ever seen"", he becomes obsessed with discovering Borden's secret. Of Nolan's' films, The Prestige is most like Memento, at least in terms of its narrative structure. It is chronologically mixed up, forcing the viewer to pay constant attention to what is going on, as it can take a while to work out exactly when a particular scene is set (there are no subtitle clues or such like). This can prove slightly disorientating at first, but it is just another way for Nolan to keep his audience guessing, and keep the suspense up. Indeed, the constant build up of suspense feels in many ways like a well crafted horror film, with the film drenched in period atmosphere and misdirection. On the topic of period, The Prestige is also noticeable for not forcing the time period on the audience. There are no sweeping shots showing us the grandeur of Victorian London or any such thing; the camera is constantly focusing on the characters, not their surroundings, and this combined with the use of a hand-held camera gives the film a near-claustrophobic feel, accentuating the mood still further. Performance-wise, both the main characters give the best performances of their careers  Jackman especially showing depth that his recent blockbuster films have not allowed him to do. His portrayal of Angier first evokes our sympathy, but his descent into obsession quickly makes us reconsider who our loyalties lie with. Borden, who seems to be the clear-cut villain of the film, begins to steal our sympathies away from Angier despite knowing that he is certainly no better a person than Angier becomes. Of the supporting cast, Michael Caine is as strong as ever, and David Bowie's odd choice of casting is let go by his steely characterisation of Nikola Tesla. Only Scarlett Johansson disappoints with a dodgy English accent failing to give her role any spark. But her role is small and thus not a great dent to the film. The film seems so based in a fictional reality that the more fantastical scenes that crop up (involving the real life character of Tesla and his involvement in Borden's/Angier's tricks) seem to go a little too far; stick with it though, and the result is an incredibly well constructed tale with brilliant performances that really will keep you guessing right up until the end. The bad points? Well, like any magic trick, once you know the secret, the trick becomes less special. In fairness to Nolan, the audience has to know the big secret for the film to make any sense. However, as if the film was a magic trick, the ending takes something away from the rest of the film. It's not that it cheapens the film  indeed, the ending is handled quite expertly  it's just that one wishes the trick could stay and wonder us for a long time to come, rather than be revealed. It's a shame that films can't do this like true magic can, because otherwise The Prestige would be on it's way to being the perfect ten. Rated: 8.5/10More reviews at: http://www.thelazylounge.net"
" Egaging Thriller
",,"Entertaining and thought provoking. This film uses magic as ""theMcGuffin"" in a story that is more of a Hitchcockian mystery and H.G. Welles style sci-fiction and revenge thriller. Magic, and the performance of it are the side light setting of this tale of two men obsessed with one-upsmanship, hatred, and ultimately, personal depravity.Excellently produced, the above the title actors all perform well, some surprise luminaries show up in smaller roles, and the heart of the story is Rebecca Hall (as Bale's common law wife), turning in a tattered, star-making performance that steals the show from all the glossier people. Michael Cain keeps the action moving in a narrative role that sees quite a bit of action.The leads here are very hard to care about, Johannson and Bale don't have much sparkle, and it is especially notable in her performance where see seems mostly rather bored, and this makes it begin to feel too long. Jackman always has sparkle, and plays his own double  believable a completely different person, unfortunately, the double (a soused, underemployed great thespian) is more interesting than the anti-hero. Clearly, Jackman will make the transition to older character actor with a second half of his career that will eclipse all his handsome leading men. Something to look forward to!A completely engaging and entertaining thriller, with many twists and turns, you need to keep tuned in to keep track. The final reveal happens so quickly that some may not understand what really was happening. The advert says you'll want to watch it again as soon as it is over. I did not want to, but it certainly did keep me thinking and puzzling out some of the plot points and questions of morality/mortality. ( I watched this with THE ILLUSIONIST, which was underrated, that film is much more magical and romantic, my favorite of the two.)"
" Modern Magicians
",,"I agree with those who have said that ""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" are not really comparable just because they are stories of magicians in the Victorian Era, (although I think ""The Prestige"" must be Edwardian because Nikola Tesla didn't move to Colorado Springs until 1899). But you can learn about films by comparing them to similar films and the temptation to make the comparison is great. When I rent films, I usually rent two at time because I figure one of them is bound to be better than the other. I find it interesting to rent films that have some relation to each other: the original and the remake or the sequel; two films with the same actor or director or author; two top films from the same year, or two films in the same genre. These two were an ideal mix.They are both well made and have interesting stories. The big difference is that ""The Illusionist"" is a romantic caper film and ""The Prestige"" is a dark examination of rivalry and revenge. The characters in the first are more likable and the story more palatable. I enjoyed the film more. The acting is a mixed bag: Edward Norton gives a performance that is restrained to the point of being flat. Jessica Biel is adequate. Rufus Sewell is fine and Paul Giamatti again dominates a good picture, although someone should tell him that the old theatrical scene-stealing technique of whispering your lines went out with Oliver Reed. Christian Bale dominates every scene with Hugh Jackman. He just has more gravitas. Michael Caine is Michael Caine, which is fine. Scarlett Johansson is Scarlett Johanssen, which is OK.What's interesting is the reaction of some fans that magic tricks that are the result of trick photography or CGI somehow are disappointing. The cinema did not evolve from the theater or from novels. It evolved from magic. Its predecessor was the ""magic lantern show"", which used some of the same concepts of projected images and the simulation of motion, was used first by magicians and not story-tellers. The works of Georges Méliès were those of a magician, not a novelist. If Eisenheim, Borden or Angier where here today, I think they'd all approve of the magic show these films represent. Then they'd probably become filmmakers themselves."
" how far can prestige go?
",spoiler,"OK, im not saying i didn't like this movie, as a matter of fact i loved it, cause we could learn something from this, its a moral kinda thing. Here is my point of view:Twin #2 i don't think his twin brother wanted to get executed at all.Twin #1 he risked everything and everyone,by losing the one he loved (his wife suicide), destroyed his daughters life (no mommy) and let die the one that stood by his side all the time until the end (twin #2 executed), just to get back his prestige? and after killing his rival what? I think he lost more in life, than what he really gained, he gained prestige but lost happiness. I say the hell with it, why not answer the damn question instead, why did you tie that motherfu_king knot? how hard can that be,lol"
" In 'magic' it's all about the third act! The Prestige.
",spoiler,"""The third stage is sometimes called the effect, or the prestige, and this is the product of magic."" (Christopher Priest) That is the derivation of the movie's title. The whole plot involves two magicians who are competing ever since they were magician helpers together. Their jealousy and desire to learn of each others' best magic tricks provide the tension in the story.Hugh Jackman is Robert Angier, eventually the lesser of the two, and who spends much of the movie time trying to avenge a death. Christian Bale as Alfred (Freddy) Borden is the better of the two, always seeming to one-up Angier. Michael Caine is Cutter who designs the illusions and equipment, and is ready backstage with an ax in case the escape from the water tank is not made on time.Scarlett Johansson (with British accent) as Olivia Wenscombe becomes the 4th member of the circle. She at first assists Angier, but he sends her to get a job with Borden, to learn the secret to his ""transported man"" trick.An interesting casting is David Bowie as Nikola Tesla, a real historical scientist who experimented with electricity. Many recognize his name for the ""Tesla coil."" I didn't recognize Bowie during the movie.We found it a very interesting 2 hours. All the cast members are good and the twists and turns held our attention.SPOILERS. Early when Angier and Borden are working together, and Angier's young wife is part of the act, she drowns after being dropped into the water tank because she cannot get out of the wrist knot that Borden tied, and thus could not reach around and unlock the trick lock. Angier never forgives Borden, and much later a trial found Borden guilty of killing someone else and sentenced to a hanging. Eventually Angier develops a transported man illusion, using a very close double they find, on one side of the stage Angier opens a door to conceal his dropping below the stage, while behind the door on the other side of the stage the double surfaces from beneath. Trouble with the double (doubt planted by Borden in a pub) cut that act short. Meanwhile Borden was doing his amazing trick and only at the end, while Angier is dying, do we learn that there were 2 Bordens, identical twins. One was loyal to his wife, the other was in love with Olivia. There was no cheating.Within that story, was a highly fictional one where Angier paid Tesla to develop an electrical device which ""transported"" him by actually creating an exact double of himself, which of course he had to drown each performance to hide the fact. He framed Borden with one of those drownings."
" Confused thriller about two magician's rivalry in Victorian London.
",,"There's only one way to say it: this is a bad movie! It uses a conventional form of interweaving the past and the present, starting with a pivotal event, the death of one magician with the other in attendance, and weaves back and forth, in and out, all the way through to the present.Within this conventional structure we are supposed to be amazed by the magic, which is not particularly amazing, and we are almost always shown the techniques they use. Again, the magic in the film is mostly conventional.The characters are the part of the movie that is not conventional, each one having enough neuroses and personality disorders to make them interesting, and rather humanly inconsistent, but also annoying and totally unbelievable. And I believe that all things that happen in movies have to appear credible, even the incredible events and plot twists. All of the ones in this movie seem terribly contrived.With all the time they take for exposition (2 hours and 10 minutes!) they still have to hit you over the head with some of the plot points, and that is a sure sign of bad direction -- I won't spoil it by telling you where these are, they are so obvious that you will most likely be able to anticipate every surprise and be a bit bored as I was.What kept me watching was the fabulous Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, and the beautiful sets and costumes of Victorian England."
" One of 2006's Best --- Overshadowed by The Illusionist
",,"Odd that in 2006 --- the worst year in 70 years in terms of film quality --- that TWO superior and engrossing dramas would be made about turn-of-the-century magicians. Odder still that magicians are not very interesting to begin with, at least not anymore.Look at Sigfried & Roy. They put on one of the leading magic shows, with their tigers appearing and transformed all over the Mirage stage. Great, but then we saw a magician at Bally's (not the show's leading act) make tigers appear and disappear quicker than S & F ever did. This guy said disappearing tigers is the easiest trick in the book ""once you know how."" Then there's David Copperfield and his nonsense about transporting a person from New York to Hawaii in 2 seconds. Gag me, please! Anyway, both Illusionist and Prestige are set in the late 19th Century, when magic was obviously much better than today. In my opinion the plot line ""In 19th Century Vienna, an illusionist uses his powers to gain a woman of higher stature, once his first love"" is so much more interesting than a deadly rivalry between two master magicians. Both pictures are skillfully acted and produced, but Illusionist is the better of the two.My recommendation: With DVD's for rent at $2.65 or less; by all means just go wild and see both films."
" Okay-Good
",,"Two Magicians Angier (Jackman) and Borden (Bale) who were once friends now are intent on destroying the other by learning each others' magic secrets. Sounds like this will be very good, doesn't it?""There are 3-parts to a magic act"" as Cuttter (Caine) tells us in the beginning and at the end of the movie, the Pledge, the Turn, and the Prestige. Who knew? You want me to tell you what each one is, don't you? Not going to happen. I just like the parts where now you see it, now you don't; or where you see nothing and then you see something. Anyway, now you know there will be twists and turns and that is what you expect to see, and you are not disappointed. The beginning of this movie is somewhat confusing, but it all works out and yet, there are still some parts I am not up on. I might have to see this again. They go into flashbacks and somehow you have to keep telling yourself it is a flashback you think. See? Troubles there too. And, the problem with the flashbacks have to do with a murder that you didn't see happen and that was confusing until the last 10-minutes. It was confusing because I kept asking myself for most of the movie, how was the murder committed? Why is this person in jail? See? Was I misdirected by the Director who knows misdirection is the key to magic? Hmmmm.The audio (or was it the English accents) was a problem for some of the dialogue that I couldn't get, but otherwise the cinematography, the dialogue in general, and the acting performances were okay. However, I keep thinking that Christian Bale was not right for the role he played. I don't think he brought his ""A"" game. Is there another Batman film in his future? Wasn't truly aware that David Bowie (he played Tesla) was in this. He is outstanding. And, when he spoke I said ""that sounds like Pierce Brosnan, imitating a slow-talking Chinaman speaking very good English."" It was great. I loved it. Michael Caine is always good and he is the only Englishman I can understand easily. As for Scarlett Johansson, I wasn't aware she was in this movie also (I don't look at the box). She is, as always, excellent, but needs a movie with more lines. We don't see enough of her. Again, some humor might have helped this production, as things were played much too seriously, and, there were too many scenes that were too dark to really see what was going on. And, you will never guess the outcome in the last 10-minutes. And, after you see the outcome, you may want to see the movie again to be sure you understood what you thought you understood. Save me a seat as I need to catch up on some things too. But, despite some shortcomings, this is a good movie, not as good as The Illusionist, but okay-good. Violence:Yes, Sex: No, Nudity: No, Language: No"
" The Pledge, The Turn, The Prestige: We see what we want to see
",,"Jonathan and Christopher Nolan have collaborated on previous projects (namely the brilliant MEMENTO) and here take on Christopher Priest's dazzling novel THE PRESTIGE. Where MEMENTO kept the audience tense and on the edge of the seat and of quizzical mind, THE PRESTIGE attempts to use the same techniques but ends up being an overly long, at times ponderous, and ultimately rather bland examination of illusion and magic and the need audiences have to believe in what they see as an exit route from the mundane lives they lead.The time is turn of the century England (with a foray into the United States) when Magic Shows were a popular form of entertainment (as they still are in Las Vegas). Two friends - Borden (Christian Bale) and Angier (Hugh Jackman) - are both fascinated with illusion and are frequent audience volunteers for magician tricks. The boys become magicians themselves with Borden becoming the superior illusionist and Angier the superior showman. Their rivalry is healthy until an unfortunate illusion/trick fails at the hands of Borden and the loss of the beloved assistant of Angier. From this point the two friends become archenemies, each sworn to discover the secrets of the other, a journey which eventually leads to murder and the ultimate illusion of life over death.There are so many subplots that they defy summation. Suffice it to say that inventors (electricity scientist Nikola Telsa - David Bowie), magic machine creators (Cutter - Michael Caine), wives (Julia Angier - Piper Perabo and Sarah Borden - Rebecca Hall), lovers (Olivia - Scarlett Johansson) all weave in and out of the plot, at times illuminating the ideas and at times confusing them. The ending is predictable: it is the only way to explain the Transported Man secret trick. Still, in all, THE PRESTIGE is an entertaining if uninvolving film and while the characters may not make us care very much for them, they are well executed by a strong and literate cast. The production values are what really make the film work. Worth an evening's viewing - a long evening... Grady Harp"
" was the intend to let the viewer to figure out the 'prestige' of the movie?
",spoiler,"it is curious to me after watching the film that why some of the scenes that gave way Borden's version of ""the transported man"", or more obviously, Angier's version, was left in the film.It seems that if those scenes were cut, outcome would have had more ... ""wow"" factor, with more of a The Sixth Sense type of ending. But that way, IMHO, would be less friendly in terms of increasing audience participation level, and more in-line with the introduction by Michael Caine on the 3 ""acts"" of magic.Or was that the trick? Since the film is so plot based, the element that would 'interest' a goer would be how the twist of the plot can be presented, in a refreshing way, instead of cheating out the audience, or adapt more character insight - which the story do not allow in the film slot time of around 120 minutes, and the 2 major characters.would I rate this higher then The illusionist? Or can it be compared? I'll leave that up to you!!!"
" Great Story, Lifeless Acting
",,"The Prestige, the newest film from acclaimed director Christopher Nolan(Memento, Batman Begins) is an extremely well written and thought provoking film that makes the viewer think about what is happening in the film. It is a film that may require multiple viewing for a complete understanding of the story. As far as scenery and production, the film succeeds on all levels. That being said, the film's biggest flaw is this: the acting is wooden. While the characters are well written and developed, the actors fail to convey any sort of emotional pull for their characters. The two leads, Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman, are both talented actors, a fact which is not in doubt. However, their performances fail to captivate the audience to care what happens to them. Michael Caine gives as usual a capable performance, but his character really doesn't affect anything. The same goes for David Bowie. Scarlett Johansson is wasted as Jackman's assistant who abandons him for Bale. She comes off as a gold-digging woman who doesn't really love either of the two magicians. The film's ending is clever, but to have been great, it would have required for the audience to still care about the fates of the two leads. The fact of the matter is that the film has a great script, as well as great direction by Nolan, but both are wasted by wooden, mediocre performances."
" Nearly as flawed as it is amazing
",,"Vastly entertaining period piece, centered around the rivalry between two magicians desperate to one-up each other, could have been one of the greatest mainstream riddlers to come along in some time. Instead, The Prestige tries so desperately to be the mind-melt it is envisioned as that the constant surprises feel suspiciously rote, character motivation feeling surprisingly laughable. Clearly, the Nolan brothers' dense script wished to outdo themselves, perhaps a tad overambitious coming from minds that produced the solid, compelling, deliciously confusing Memento.Here, crazy turn of events run like clockwork, authenticity comes and goes depending on the scene, and viewers foolishly witness a plot inside a vacuum that does not contrast any sort of real world interaction with the magic-centric scenario. All this makes the enjoyable twists and turns that Christopher Nolan employs throughout the introspective romp feel slightly less impacting then they should have, at times even coming across as laughably ridiculous; which is a shame really, since this original cat and mouse tale still ends up being something quite special. Banking on heavy replay value through inherent ambiguities that further enhance the mystery's shelf life, there is still an admirable amount of rational explanation to justify the increasingly unbelievable and enjoyable pace that will continue to indulge throwing viewers out of the loop if they do not, as illusionist Alfred Borden insists ""pay attention"". The brief narration may feel slightly condescending by basking in the art of it's own clever twists, but if someone had to be pretentious about the intricate script they have crafted, I am glad it is these guys. I just wished they would have spent a little more time fine tuning some of the individual scenes, since their ambitions often seemed to exceed a hard pressed wow factor. Cast-wise, the always hard working Christian Bale seems to be the only one that truly owned his character in the period it was meant to take place. Hugh Jackman usually felt way too modernized, and the A-list supporting cast felt out of place, almost superfluous. Even Michael Caine, one of our oldest and most respected working actors around, here in a role that is written as the glue to hold all of these wild themes together, feels unnecessary and forced most of the time. All in all though, The Prestige is a treat, overcoming the awkward setup to seduce viewers into caring about this most irrelevant of fictitious rivalries with compelling, creative force by the time the stage curtain has lowered."
" The Prestige
",spoiler,"Christopher Nolan is really one of the most reliable directors working today. That's really something I appreciate very much and ""The Prestige"" is yet one another great piece of cinema. I like movies that deal with obsession. A recent one was ""The Aviator"" which I absolutely loved, but most people didn't. A thing that nearly all stories about main characters, who are obsessed with something share, is that their heroes are having the biggest troubles when it comes to interpersonal relations, and mainly in their love life. And that's a theme, which always gets me. The highlight of ""The Prestige"" for me is Christian Bale. His character and the way he plays him, that's A-rate acting. I also liked the  nowadays omnipresent  Scarlett Johansson, who had an unthankful thin part. Nolan continues his confusing style of storytelling and keeps the tempo up. A great thriller, although the way the end resolution was unveiled felt awkwardly inappropriate to me."
" what a twist!!!!
",spoiler,"love it to bits.. Everything about it was amazing. The script, the acting, the filming and the location was just PERFECT! Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale were amazing. We would have NEVER thought to put them in the same movie together. Their relationships were VERY real. They were almost like best friends at one point (before the fighting, shooting and WIFE KILLING started) and played both the friendly and competitive personalities superbly. The flow of it worked well, how it could jump from being a romantic scene to Christian Bale getting his fingers shot off. It just worked. They never really led on to the fact that Christian Bale had a twin and Hugh Jackman was duplicating himself time and time again and then killing his duplicate. (not at ALL) although if you watched it again you would be able to pick stuff out like the VERY beginning where Sarah's nephew asks ""But where's his brother?"" after being shown Bale's bird trick. (VERY OBVIOUS, RIGHT?) In conclusion, very muchly amazing and suspensefulP.S. can you say David BOWIE WITH A CREEPY MUSTACHE?!?!"
" As simple as that.

If you have seen it - you know everything i can say.If you haven't seen it - you've got to do everything possible, but see it.After watching the film I've had a strange feeling left - just like I understand everything in this movie, although in fact I understood nothing... Guess, that's what The Prestige means.Speaking with bare facts - Hugh Jackman's play is amazing. Never thought that it could be at such a high level. Bale is very, very good.

" Machines - Clones and Actors

Kinda a giveaway huh!They say the simple truth is the hardest to grasp and makes for the best illusion ... the simplest explanation is the unbelievable truth the machine works!Its only a film so I can go with this, hell if I wanna rip a film for unbelievability and paradox I will watch 'Back to the future' 1 - 2 and 3 ... but the idea of a movie as with magic is to without our sense on disbelief and THIS film does that perfectly as the twist is... there is no twist! It WORKED and its kinda sick when yu think about it!AND THERE IS MORE....Remember the bird in the cage trick ... one smushed bird (Same deal)Loads more to look at in the film, but basically it says magic lies between the lines and thats the illusion, when the illusion is best placed ON the lines where you Don't expect it to be found!Either way, its got everyone here talking about it and I think I will get the DVD for the extras to see if they have an alt ending with clones everywhere covered in squashed doves:)ENJOY THE FILMI did"
" You don't really want to know the secret. You want to be fooled.
",spoiler,"The Prestige is not a bad movie. Its luxurious cast consists of Hugh Jackman (X-men), Christian Bale (Equilibrium, Batman Begins), Sir Michael Caine (Children of Men), and most important of all, Scarlett Johansson (Lost in translation). It has plenty of twists and turns in its plot, and unravels secret after secret to keep you anxious about the truths till the end. Magicians went mad, scientist got crazy. Even without all these splendors, the Prestige is still good enough for its revealing all the gadgets and tricks about which conjurer had their mouse kept shut for centuries.But I felt a fool when the final answer was given. I don't like being fooled so I'll drop my rating substantially for this movie. Had I been told that it was a fantasy movie, I would have accepted its alibi and left the cinema satisfactorily. Had I not been a graduate student who happened to pick the Mind Body problem for this quarter, I would have believed its explanations and stop questioning its logical validity. But the final part now looks so ridiculous that I feel obliged to use some paragraphs to reprove the stupidity that blemished all these clever tricks.Firstly, and most obviously, if we are willing to assume that such a copy machine could exist, then unlimited profit could be made. Just copy wealth. What they used it for in the movie was so dumb that makes most of the second half hilarious.Secondly, we forget about gold-copying fantasy and just focus on human duplication. Body duplication is quite straightforward biology and physics. It is the mind that is befuddling us. Actually this is a legitimate question of cognitive science, and quite some papers have been published about it. Basically there are two schools of theories. Egoism talks about self being a unique, continuous entity that does not necessarily depend on the physical existence. Such kind of self has an old alias, ""soul"". Soul is commonly described it as induplicatable. The logic is, if two souls claim one identity simultaneously, then it should be considered as one. Therefore, as soon as a mind is duplicated, they by definition will merge back into one. The bundle theorists disagree with the concept of a unique soul. These people held that in deed there is no self at all  all are just bits and pieces of various inputs, bundled together to give the body illusion of a self. In such cases, duplicated body entails different selves, and the consciousness could never be smoothly transferred before and after the duplication. In summary: no consciousness preserving mind duplication could exist.Finally, if Fallon could behave that cruel to their family as depicted in the movie, then after getting jailed, why would he care about his daughter so much at all? Despite these logical flaws, the Prestige is still quite absorbing. Scarlett Johansson is so gorgeous that just her appearance in the movie worth the ticket. The first half is intense and reasonable in plot. The second part is  well, let me here quote the last line: ""You don't really want to know the secret... You want to be fooled."" Yes, I hate the secret Chris Nolan gave up at the end."
" Were you watching closely?
",,"Because if you were, than this movie shouldn't have seemed that great in the end. I had high hopes for The Prestige. I thought to myself, if Nolan thinks this is important enough to be made before Batman Begins 2, than it should be good. Unfortunately, the film fails to be completely amazing as I thought it would be.Yes, the cinematography is beautiful, it throws you right in the middle of Angier and Borden's rivalry. Yes, Jackman and Bale's acting is superb and convincing. Yes, the directing is nothing short of amazing. So, in that case, what was missing? Call me crazy, but this film was predictable. If you simply pay attention to the story, you can figure out the ending 10 minutes or so before it. That's OK by, but why did they have to reveal the twist at the very end, when everyone already understands everything? Did they actually think the story was THAT complex? Because it wasn't. Nolan gives us this big, breathtaking finally, thinking that we're idiots, who can't figure out what is so painfully obvious. Well, I'm sure he doesn't really think that we are idiots, but it sure looks like it.In the way it was made, The Prestige really reminded me of Memento. Not that it's a bad thing, it's just that Memento worked on every level possible, but The Prestige just doesn't. It's like a step back from the brilliance that was Memento.Otherwise, this film was marvelous. And thankfully, I'm not someone who hates an utterly brilliant film, just because the ending was too simple. I am more interested in the process, than the result. And this film is a perfect example of when the process is more tasteful than the result.8/10"
" An Original Movie
",,"Spoilers: The Prestige focuses on the blood feud between American abroad Robert Angier (Jackman) and Cockney Alfred Borden (Christian Bale).They're introduced as ""volunteers"" picked from an English music hall audience to bind magician's assistant Julia (Piper Perabo). Plunged into a water tank, she miraculously escapes. In fact, the two young men are apprentice magicians, secretly a part of the act. Further, Julia is wife to personable Robert. He's a natural showman, while taciturn Alfred is a more gifted illusionist.But in the name of slick presentation, Alfred takes risks that don't pass muster with safety-minded mentor Cutter (Michael Caine). One day, Alfred ties a more-difficult yoke with Julia's permission that results in her being unable to free herself; she drowns before an ax can break the glass tank.Robert is enraged and inconsolable,particularly when he spies Alfred with new wife, Sarah (Rebecca Hall), and baby,the happy family he feels robbed of.The men develop separate acts, with Robert's successful while Alfred toils in dives. Nonetheless, Robert remains consumed by thoughts of vengeance. What starts out an exchange of petty humiliations turns into vicious, increasingly violent one-upmanship.Seeing Alfred perform a stupendous act called ""The Transported Man,"" Robert vows to steal it. When he's unable to figure it out himself, he dispatches on stage assistant and offstage lover Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) to seduce the secret from his rival. This central chronology is interspersed throughout with dual flash-forward threads. In one, Robert travels to Colorado Springs to petition reclusive inventor Nikola Tesla (David Bowie) to build a machine like the transport he supposedly built for Alfred. In the other thread, Alfred stands trial for the death of Robert, whom we've seen drown just like his late wife.This movie actually turned out better than I had expected. Jackman, Bale and Johansson did a particularly good job. Overall, this movie's definitely worth seeing. A few twists in the end will leave you in awe, but you'll love it just the same. Great acting, original plot, amazing magic tricks revealed and not boring at all. If you enjoyed watching ""The Illusionist"", you will not be disappointed.Highly recommended. 8/10"
" A great looking movie, almost too grim to recommend
",,"If the misdirections in The Prestige are effective (and even if they aren't), the suspense, intrigue, and sometimes humor of competing illusionists can make for an entertaining story. I also enjoyed how the movie moved back-and-forth through different time points to keep me curious and interested. However, at the same time, the emotional effect of some of the underlying themes and metaphors and the way they were developed was pretty grim and unsettling. The most obvious (and effective) to me dealt with the existential costs of letting certain perceived inadequacies and vanities drive your obsessions. The beautifully rich and dark, and sometimes grotesque, tones of the Victorian and Colorado settings seemed to enhance those feelings and also made the movie appealing to look at. Some of the key plot differences from the book leave even less room for sympathy for some of the characters, yet somehow the overall effect still felt worth the experience."
" A weak spot in the setup
",,"We are mystified about which kind of knot Borden ties before the accident, and I find it strange, however dramatically efficient, that Nolan doesn't use the question until the burial. I think that in real life that would be the first thing one would check to see what went wrong with a trivial trick - especially because it has been an issue between them. But certainly a highly entertaining movie, with great acting, beautiful pictures, and a catching storyline. Like ""The Departed"" it is a movie one can watch over and over again and still enjoy for it's many twists and cleverly situated clues. The mind-blowing experiment with electricity which is accredited to Dr Telsa, is symbolically destroyed by Edison. The rivalry of the plot mirrors itself on another level, bringing back the words of Oscar Wilde from the same period: ""The world is(...)tolerant, it will forgive anything; except genius."""
" 3 illogical mistakes
",spoiler,"3 (illogical) mistakes probably deliberately made by the director.The first two are made for the benefit of the story (you have to go along with it): 1) When Borden's engineer is kidnapped by Angier and Cutter he's questioned. They don't find out he's missing two fingers, he has a false beard and is Borden's twin brother?2) When Angier is doing his final act Borden's mind never crossed the idea Angier is working again with his lookalike?Then the third mistake is made out of marketing/commercial reasons (also known : artistic freedom of the director) :3) In the lost shot we see a copy (made by the machine) of Angier drown in a water-tank. This is a blink to the audience of the movie : does the machine really work or not? Open end! Discus it, talk about it, search for a logical explanation,.... extra publicity for the movie....etcIt's like the manager of Elvis once said : ""I don't care what they say about Elvis, as long as they talk about him"".By the way the audience sees Angier make a trip to Colorado Springs, meeting professor Tesla, seeing the machine duplicate (living) things. We all see these things according the diary of Angier ; a diary specially made to misguide Borden so he will give up his secret. For all we know Angier did meet Tesla, saw that he was an impostor and made up a fake diary to get even with Borden. (Borden gave him deliberately a false clue with the name 'Tesla')Remember The Usual Suspects : Kevin Spacey made up a story for Chazz Palminteri about 'Keyser Söze'.... etc. At the end of the movie we realize that 95% of it is just a made up story by a crook. Well, probably 95% of the diary of Angier is made up as well.Angier waits until Borden goes looking in the basement to settle the score with him and Angier's lookalike.Voilà."
" Entertaining but not much
",spoiler,"I went to see this movie because I liked Memento, because it was about magicians and because Hugh Jackman was in it, and it was a bit disappointing. The first half hour, which should introduce the characters and make the viewer understand their situations, was plain and poorly told. After that half hour the director gives a few too obvious clues that with a little imagination let the viewer figure out the end in 2 seconds. I was one of those and I guessed the end, but I was curious about how the director was going to make it happen. The next half hour has some clever twists (the script keeps being poor though) and that is the part I enjoyed most. But then the director gives the movie a sci-fi turn and suddenly an unbelievable machine is used to give an end to the story. Looked like the director couldn't come up with a decent end after so many twists and he had to make up a machine to fix it. Well, I didn't buy it. I like the idea of multiple Hugh Jackmans circulating all over the world though :D"
" LOVED the trick with the canary!
",spoiler,"Performing magic shows is literally a 'tricky' business. Unquestionably these magicians are good artists, as they have to disguise a presumably very simple and logical trick and build a whole show around it, but at the same time the whole concept quickly tends to get boring. Just because you automatically presume there's a simple explanation for every illusion, you risk losing interest and I was more or less worrying that the movie would suffer from this exact same problem. It isn't very interesting to hear Michael Caine enlightening us about the different phases of a successful trick and it's even less interesting to constantly hear about two beginning magicians wanting to become the biggest performers of their time. Personally, I wasn't really hoping for a thriller revealing a lot of magic-secrets. I was merely anticipating a dark & sinister post-Gothic portrait revolving personal vendettas and macabre set pieces. And for the largest part, The Prestige actually delivers! The man in the director's chair is Christopher Nolan, and both ""Memento"" and ""Insomnia"" already proved he's a terrific storyteller, as he has the talent to bring an ordinary tale much more complex than it actually is. Nolan once again uses as irregular narrative structure, with jumps back and forward into time and well-camouflaged hints that eventually all lead to a gigantically grotesque denouement. Robert Angier (Hugh ""Wolverine"" Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian ""Batman Begins"" Bale) are two gifted pupils of the already legendary 'engineer' Cutter (Michael Caine), both treasuring the ambition to become the nation's biggest magician. A regretful accident, resulting in Angier's wife tragic death on stage, causes their friendship to turn into intense competition and pretty soon they spend even more time sabotaging each other's shows than actually building up their own acts. When Alfred Borden eventually presents his perplexing Transported Man trick and Angier can't possibly decipher the logic behind it, the rivalry turns into a dangerous obsession that will require large sacrifices. The main attraction of this film is probably meant to be the guessing along for the tricks and the detailed exposition of a handful of basic magical acts, but honestly that whole aspect impressed me the least. With just a tad bit of concentration and the experience of having seen similar mystery-thrillers, the red herrings are fairly transparent. Also, the whole set-up of Robert Angiers ultimate act (with the help of pop star David Bowie in a remarkable role) is simply impossible to take serious. Whatever remains, however, is definitely worth watching. The mysterious late 19th Century set pieces are intriguing, especially the transporting machinery which seems to be inspired by the ""telepods"" in David Cronenberg's ""The Fly"". The detailed illustration of magical tricks didn't really fascinate me, although there's one notable exception: the disappearing canary! It's a cruel and pretty offensive old-school trick, but hilarious in case you have a weird sense of humor. Quite embarrassing, because I was the ONLY person in a sold-out theater who was laughing with this sequence. The acting performances are top-notch, but with an ensemble cast like this we wouldn't accept it any other way. Particularly Christian Bale is terrific, since his naturally mysterious charisma is ideal for a role as a magician. Scarlett Johansson's part is rather small, but her beautiful appearance helps cheering up the dark sets a lot."
" Were you watching closely? An explanation of The Prestige. (spoilers)
",spoiler,"The Prestige is a beautifully intricate movie with a very disappointing end. Or at least that was what I thought as I watched the ""Deus ex machina"" that the Nolan brothers decided to pull at the last minute to extricate themselves from a plot that, perhaps, was starting to spin out of control from some many ""twists and turns"".However, I couldn't keep my mind from the last few lines of the movie that seemed to speak directly to the viewer. Were we wanting to be fooled by the lightning and thunder of the Tesla machine, because the true explanation of the trick is just too simple and uninteresting? And so it dawned on me the idea that the Tesla Machine doesn't really work. That the Prestige is not a sci-fi film, but that it is 100% realistic. That, in fact, one of its many ideas is that behind all the hocus-pocus of magic lie simple and oftentimes disappointing explanations.So, what follows is my opinion of what really happened. I think it can provide for an interesting reinterpretation of many of the film's scenes and dialogs.I believe Tesla, a man with evident showmanship as depicted in his public exhibition in the Albert Hall, ended up agreeing to build the transporting machine for Angier, in order to fund his research. Not being able of constructing such an impossible device, he planned with his magic-enthusiast assistant a little bit of a magic show of their own. The cats and the hats scene was staged by them to led Angier to believe that the machine worked as a replicator.The scientific-naïve Angier was played upon, with the two men of science humoring him with good-natured irony. For indeed Tesla did not really want to swindle Angier. He did build and supplied him with the only possible machine that could be built: an illusionist's contraption.Angier tested his new acquisition and realized that no such replicating machine existed, and that Borden must have been using a double all along. He understood now, however, the deceptive power of science, and returned to London with the idea of employing the machine in a new trick and in the enactment of his final revenge upon Borden. Ironically, his new trick was not new at all, but was the same old simple trick as before. Whenever Borden was not present, Angier himself appeared in the prestige, being finally able to personally receive the audience's applause at the end.He knew Borden would come to see the act, so whenever he spotted him in the audience we would present the Transported Man himself and his double would only appear for ""the prestige"" far away in the balcony, and therefore not recognizable by Borden, who was now starting to be taken in, as Angier had been, by the power of the ""true magic"" of science.In the day Borden came intending to expose the trick, Angier, who was watching for this moment, spotted him among the volunteers from the public and quickly had placed the water-tank under the trap door.However, things turned for Angier when Cutter went to see him and learned of the truth. Upon meeting ""Lord Caldlow"", the pragmatically minded Cutter finally understood the true nature of the trick. In his mind, Angier had gone too far that time by killing an innocent man and using Cutter himself to incriminate and sentence to death their former colleague.Cutter suspected, from the first Transported Man, that ""Borden"" might have a twin, which he confirmed when Fallon was kidnapped. He thought the only fair thing to do was to give the surviving Borden the chance of retribution.In the warehouse, a disenchanted Cutter sets the tone for the final sequence: ""Take a minute to consider your achievement."" He then tells him about the sailor who said drowning was like going home. Angier had taken comfort in that thought, not only in connection with his wife death, but to appease his mind for the murder he committed.Angier, who had struggled with the idea of drowning, upon seeing Cutter leave instinctively turns his lantern towards a water-tank, and what does he see? A corpse strongly resembling himself. In a split second he understands that it must have been put there by Cutter. He even knows how he did it: ""No one cares about the man in the box"".Cutter, who was a master of characterization, obtained and characterized several corpses (men in boxes no one cares about) to resemble Angier, the effect being aided by the obfuscation in the warehouse and of the water-tanks themselves.However, Angier was still not able to understand the purpose of all this. It was then that in entered Fallon, who tells him about the true nature of his relation to ""Borden"" and how they performed their trick, not before shooting Angier in the chest.Angier, a dying man, now understands that the twin was let in by Cutter in order to kill him, but also that Cutter in his sympathy did not wish to dispossess him of his strange ""achievement"", which he so greatly prized. And so Angier takes advantage of the scenario Cutter prepared for him and proceeds to play on Borden the final part of his trick, telling him the imaginary story of his first use of the machine and the ""price"" that he had paid for his art.For he knew well that he had paid a great price  an innocent man's life and his own. But in the game of illusion and masterful deceit, Borden's secret disclosed and his own preserved, he had been the victor  and he had, after all, performed a most wonderful magic trick in this ""solid, solid world"".In the end, a close shoot of one the tanks is shown. Not just any tank, but a special one. The tank where Root, Angier's double, lies."
" The real trick here... is having us entertained and intrigued nonstop!
",,"It's a treat to take part of this combo of adventure, thriller and character study of two rivaling magicians in London ca 1900. I find it so refreshing with a historical story and setting, that's carried out with such modern wit, cleverness and technique. And it goes deep into the dark sides of its characters, Nolan style, expectedly- it's certainly no more Mr. Nice (or good) Guy here! What's more, it throws eye-filling images, production design, two charismatic lead stars, and mind games galore at the audience. And the real trick here... is having us entertained and intrigued nonstop! But of course, it wouldn't be a magician movie without a punchline that outsmarts us and makes us lift our hats, like any great magic act. Juuust a tad long.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe"
" Very smart
",,"I went to see this film without big expectations. After all, there's another film with magic involved and none of them had Golden Globe Nominations. It was a big surprise to find such a clever and original film with many plot twists and amazing performances. I would recommend it to people who like to be surprised and to the ones who appreciate the world of showmen, circus, magicians, some bohemian love life, betrayals, etc ... The main roles (Slater and Jackman) are brilliant and very credible, and once again Michael Caine delivers a quality performance. Also Scarlett Johanson looks beautiful and is perfectly casted in this mysterious and romantic role."
" clever puzzle
",,"It's certainly impressive and the way it's filled with turns and twists makes it gain other interesting elements and gets it to continuously challenge the audience. I couldn't say the entire movie is enchanting - that's why in my opinion it doesn't deserve an excellent vote - but when surprises are revealed so that the movie-goer can find the film gripping and, in spite of the complicated plot, ""the trick works"", the result is a story interest to be told. Besiders Cristopher Nolan insists a lot on human emotions as well as on the dimensional aspect, so, although sometimes the film gets a bit too sullen and dry, I can say the aim is reached and the purpose satisfied."
" American child
",,"I enjoyed the film, it was really entertaining. However, this maybe be silly but why was the little girl American? They were living in England and her parents were English. Did I miss something?? A couple of my friends were disappointed, I just wanted to know what everyone else though in general:) This is the first time I have commented on anything, and why won't it let me post without having ten line? This is why I am filling up this post with mindless rambling......................................I liked Christian Bale better in The Machinist as well.................................................sorry about this!"
" Excellent plot- - but too predictable
",,"I went to see this movie the other day... I had seen many trailers and I've been expecting it for a long time. This is what I think about it: it has an excellent plot and pretty good performances (well...Scarlett is a piece of wood and Hugh-- I believe he didn't notice it wasn't X-men's set... but the rest of the actors are good). It has many ridiculous things (like the fact that ""Robert Angier"" kept all the bodies of the men he'd killed) but the special effects are amazing! Everything is SO predictable, that all the explanations at the end of the movie shouldn't be there... Finally, I think it could have been THE movie of the year."
" The Prestige mistakes..i guess
",spoiler,"Okay, saw the movie the 20th of October and loved it! I'd suggest though...if you saw the movie and didn't like it...then you need to read the book...it gives a better appreciation for it. I'd ALSO like to point out that Angier's first name is NOT ROBERT it's RUPERT! Okay...had to get that out...well I'd give the movie a 10/10. I *heart* Hugh Jackman. (But that's not why I loved it!) OH! In the book....Rupert didn't get shot. Julia didn't drown and Sarah didn't hang herself. but oh well.Geez...you have to make this ten lines.... This is hard. Why won't it let me send my comment yet? Grr...so you don't have to keep reading. I'm just trying to waste space."
" Tribute to Nicola Tesla
",,"This is a great movie and proof that Hollywood CAN still create excellent movies WHEN IT WANTS TO (which is not too often). The acting is excellent and the story is original and quickly engages the audience. Also, this movie is a tribute to one of the great inventors in history, Nicola Tesla. Mr. Tesla was responsible for the introduction of alternating current and knowing that will make the movie even more entertaining. Indeed, perhaps Hollywood should make a movie about the life and career of Nicola Tesla. All the actors in this movie are excellent and offer compelling and powerful performances, especially by Hugh Jackman who proves once again that he is one of the premier actors in Hollywood today. Watch this movie."
" Wowee!
",,"WHAT...A....GOOOD...MOVIE!!!! And WHAT...A...GOOD...CAST!!! And WHAT...A...GOOD...SCRIPT!! Oh and the directing rules too! Nolan is a god, how he could come up with such an elaborate story, make it into an understandable script and then make an amazningly directed film of it i just don't know.It feels impossible to me. Hugh Jackman is no longer wolverine. I don not see him as just that anymore, so thats good. He was great in this. Christin Bale i could not stand in Batman Begins, but in this he was so engaging, making im look like a subtle villain.The story is just so...wow! It never lost me or made me bored it was just...well go see it. And look oput for the twist!"
" Excellent!
",,"The Prestige is a superb movie that tells the story of two rival magicians trying to outdo each others magic tricks, sometimes without mercy. It's visually brilliant, the tricks that are performed on screen are fantastic to watch. The acting is brilliant, ""Batman vs. Wolverine"", with Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman playing great lead roles and Scarlett Johansson and Michael Caine playing really good supporting roles. But the story and plot, what the movie relies on, is fantastic. Plenty of twists and turns to keep you captivated and enough drama to keep you interested. Some of the twists are bit...well, odd, but otherwise, pretty flawless in its delivery.Great movie, a must-see for 2006."
" A Bit Predictable, but Such Fun!
",spoiler,"I will not recap the entire show, but will warn anyone reading this that spoilers abound, so quit now if you have not seen this movie.The science fiction parts of the show do deter from the final result, as I think magicians have enough going for them that science fiction need not play a part. However, once you accept that this is a science fiction story, you can relax and enjoy the superior study in personalities.The acting was very good, and I especially liked Jackman and Bowie. The ladies were overshadowed, but the movie dictated that the two male stars dominate.The ending was predetermined once you see (major spoiler) the duplicated cat and top hats. At that point, it becomes obvious what Jackman's character is going to do and how he will do it.Bales' character had a few tricks up his sleeve as well, but his motives with his wife and girlfriend are the most unbelievable. If a person truly loves someone else, a modicum of trust is mandatory.I loved the final few seconds of the film, it showed that the Jackman character was not necessarily evil, but I would be interested in knowing what happens to him later. I have not read the book, perhaps this is told there.The sets were good, the mood appropriate and I enjoyed this show more than any I have seen in 2 years. I am hard to please and the 8 out of 10 is a high mark from me. This show reminds me a lot of Michael Douglas' ""The Game"", and if you like twists upon twists, even to excess, you'll love this movie."
" Magical
",spoiler,"This film at first doesn't seem to be more than a tale of two Victorian magicians bickering over who is better, the feisty Christian Bale or the 'too wimpy for his own good' Hugh Jackman. Yet by the end of the film, the plot has made the audience look the other way and shocked us all ironically like a beautiful illusion.You never see the end coming. Bale's character has a twin yet this is never obvious. Jackman repeatedly murdering his sci fi made clones and then framing his rival for it. I swear if you haven't seen the film then all this sounds like a worst film than scary movie 4 but it works brilliantly.By its conclusion you have changed your mind so many times about who is the bad guy that you feel a little stupid yet warm inside from audience satisfaction.And David Bowie is not all that bad. Michael Caine blows the bloody doors of your mind. Both are sweet glazier cherries on a thick, rich movie trifle.This is the dogs nuts my friend. Watch it or shut up about recommending movies to anyone..ever."
" good film?
",spoiler,i loved this film and i thought it was a surprisingly good performance from bale as i wasn't really a fan Michael Caine was Michael Caine just his voice alone brings a smile to my face there are a lot of twists thats cant be explained and could be a few endings so i really recommend this film i was very impressed my dad is bringing out a film hopefully 08 maybe 09 and Hugh Jackman's wife is being approached to direct it so hopefully i will meet Hugh himself and if we are lucky we might get a role for him in there i am still in the daze of did Caine know Bale was a twin? or did he realize at the end and why was he with jess the daughter of Bale
" Do you really care about the clones!!!
",,"I really don't care much about the clones, the movies is great, the way they go back and to the future and present is good, it doesn't let you lose interest , and besides the ending is even greater, perhaps I have the same doubts, how come the clone always ends up on the tank? and why on his first try when he reached for the gun the clone tried to talk and say something, who know's and the one that got the bullet was the original Hugh and not the clone!!! shouldn't it be the same person? during the last hour of the film I was starting to hate ""Freddy"", he was bad and inhuman as Olivia called him, but with the twins everything made sense, and I feel in love with the character all over again! Every one tried to patched up their mistakes, one brother asked the other for forgiveness for Sarah's suicide and was worried hell for Jess's well being! And Cutter tried to make it up for hiding since the beginning the fact that there were two brothers, 'cause he knew, he made them disappear and reappear, as all magicians should! I hate magic"
" Just a short review, sorry about the spoilers if you haven't seen it yet
",spoiler,"""Are you watching closely?""Of all the movies that I've seen this is the best,hands down. Pretty much every thing about it made it great. The storyline, characters, and lets not forget the magic. The way the movie is made makes you wonder what is going on until the end where it all makes sense and the director becomes the magician like the ones that he has created.The best part about the movie is the way that it's told. It's a story in a story in story. You as the audience are watching a film about a man reading a book about a man reading a book. It's a little confusing at first but by the end it all makes sense. It's a lot like Nolan's other movie ""Memento""."
" Incredible
",,I can honestly say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen. It has been a long time where I have seen a movie that has kept me riveted all the way to the end. The set was brilliantly made as well as the costumes. I love movies that keep you guessing and this movie will do that all the way to the end. They do a brilliant job of portraying obsession and how it destroys lives. Hugh Jackman does an excellent job yet again his portrayal of utter obsession makes the movie brilliant.I won't give away the ending but it was hard to see coming and yet it makes perfect sense. All in all it was excellent and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to see a masterpiece of a movie.
" To those who claim to know how ""the box"" works ...
",spoiler,"... I see some people saying that the ""original"" is transported, whereas the clone remains at the point of electricity, as evidenced by the tank beneath that point ...... however, I just got back from the movie, and during Hugh Jackman's confession to Christian Bale after being shot, I thought I heard him say something to the effect of, ""you don't know how hard it was, not knowing whether I'd be the one beneath the stage (i.e. drowning) or the one in the balcony"" ...... this led me to believe that even he himself couldn't predict where the ""clone"" would end up Did I miss something, or did that actually make sense to some people?"
" big glitch
",spoiler,"In the movie there is a scene where he is testing the new machine and puts a gun next to it just in case. When he goes to turn the machine on the ""duplicate"" is created and sent to the end of the hallway, the ""original"" shoots him. When the time comes to show the magic trick on stage the ""original"" is in fact sent to the top and the duplicate would be dropped and then drowned. So the question arises, ""How does this work?"" There are a few possibilities it could have been either a big glitch that they missed. Or there could have been a replicate that knows the same exact history with the same genetic codes. Which is scientifically impossible, if you create a clone and grow it up in a different generation it will be different, so I don't see how there could be an exact copy that catches on to the whole show immediately. For the hats to disprove this either the ""original"" is sent outside or the ""duplicate"" is sent outside. If the ""original"" is sent outside, then it disproves the test where he stays and the duplicate is made outside and he picks up the gun and shoots him. If the duplicate is sent outside then it disproves the ending show where the ""original"" is in fact sent to the top and the duplicate stays. For the cats' part, if the ""original"" cat stays and a duplicate is sent out then it's the same as the hat. So no matter how it is explained, the test ruins the entire concept. If you forget the test then it is fine, and you know the ""original"" is sent out and the ""duplicate"" is dropped, or ""stays"" for the hat/cat part. If you believe that there is an exact copy made then you can believe the ""duplicate"" has the same mindset and knows all the history and information and therefore was a new one made every time, but that is not scientifically possible. If you grow (clone) a person with the same genotype then their personality will be different because they grow up in a different time and experience different things. Even though their phenotype (physical appearance) can be the same, personality cannot. So there is no justifiable reason to what happened and therefore have to accept that they messed up the whole movie with the test."
" Problems with an otherwise good film.
",spoiler,"Wouldn't Angier (assuming he is very observant) realize that Fallon (Borden's assistant) is actually Borden (considering he kidnapped him)? The credibility of the characters is contingent upon the audience (us and their own) believing in their keen ability. I find it hard to believe that all of these intellectuals never considered that Borden's double was, in fact, his assistant. Considering that Cutter assumed it was a double all along. You could argue that, in their haste, they never noticed, while they kidnapped him. However, it wouldn't even require the kidnapping for them to suspect it. Angier comments on how strange Fallon was (even under duress he never spoke). Furthermore, you could argue that Angier became so obsessed with learning the trick that he became careless in his craft. And, if the Borden twins was the supreme secret and therefore trick, why waste time on the dangerous bullet-catch trick? Why not break out the big guns earlier (no pun intended) (aside from it being a much shorter movie)? Also, as an epicurean, and skeptic, I HATE that they used Tesla to try and stamp the movie with certain credentials that the man would never abide. Tesla was certainly eccentric, but he was a scientist first and foremost, and he never made, or endeavored to make a machine like the one in the film. Its a pet-peeve when writers, and director's try to advocate chicanery with science. I go to the cinema willing to suspend disbelief. There is no need to tarnish the reputation of a great man to do this."
" fun - but not quite satisfying
",,"An enjoyable movie which will wile away your time pleasantly in the company of some excellent actors, principally Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale - the latter surely one of the most interesting, intense and unpredictable actors working in movies today. They are expertly supported by the one and only Michael Caine, with a couple of delectable cameos from Andy Serkis and David Bowie.The women's roles, though well-performed, are under-written and fundamentally unengaging. This is a regrettable flaw, but there is a greater one - a trap which the authors were clearly perfectly aware of, but didn't seem to be able to avoid.The trouble with movies which have Great Revelations in them, as the story of this one goes to great pains to point out with regard to magic tricks, is that there is an inevitable disappointment once you know the answers. Given that the Nolans knew this to be the case, one might have hoped for some chasm of mystery left open. But it's all pretty much rounded off in the manner of an old-fashioned whodunnit. One can almost hear the writers' glee as they tied up another loose end, and then planted the trail that leads to it somewhere unexpected. The last time I felt anything so self-conscious was in The Last of Sheila, many years ago. What stops this from being as brittle as that film is the warmth of Bale, Jackman and Caine. Even so, for some reason the writers' minds somehow tick away audibly in what I'm sorry to say seems to me a too-clever-by-half kind of way.Whatever my complaints, this is a very fine confection, full of clever tricks, and a pleasant way to fill a couple of hours. My feeling is that the Nolans wanted to achieve something more than that. Unfortunately, they haven't succeeded."
" Truth about the Fallon/Alfred ""relationship"".
",spoiler,"Fallon is a clone. bottom line.When Alfred explains to Fallon to ""leave Angier alone"", Fallon does not listen. The reason? Because Fallon had NO IDEA how the transported man was done. He didn't realize that he was a clone, and had no concept of there even being a possibility of making a clone. Thats why Fallon went behind Alfred's back to see how the secret works. You didn't see Alfred going to see how the trick worked because he already knew the secret. Thats why when Fallon is in prison and he's walking away from Alfred on his way to death he says that ""he should have left Angier alone"". Basically my belief is that when Alfred made his clone he never explained to Fallon that he was actually a clone, but maybe a brother."
" I'm confused about Cutter.........
",spoiler,"What was his part at the end of the movie??? All through the movie, he is friends with Hugh Jackman. What did he know about Borden in the end???? Did he help him somehow in killing Hugh Jackman?? I'm really confused. He was not going to approve of what Hugh Jackman was planning for Borden, so he tried to keep him out of it. Also, what were they trying to show at the very end of the movie, they showed Hugh laying on the floor dead, then they show a clone or whatever of him, standing somewhere else, what was that?I thought they were twins, just by how upset he was when he found out he was buried underground, and I never suspected he had a twin. Even though I am confused about the whole thing because he gave Jackman the name of the man to build his cloning machine. Where did that come from? But he did show up at Jackman's performance to see how he was doing the whole trick, why would he want to see how he did it, if he was suppose to already know? It just does not add up."
" What happened to The Prestige?
",,"There are three acts in every magic trick, as Sir Michael Cane says, the pledge, the turn and the prestige. Just like the three acts of these so-called illusions, The Prestige is played out like its subject. Christopher Nolan's newest endeavor tells the story of two magicians, Robert Angier, played by the overtly childish Hugh Jackman, and Alfred Borden, played by the always consuming Christian Bale.Separated by a magic trick gone bad, involving Angier's wife, Julia Angier (Piper Parabo) , the two magicians become rivals, sabotaging each others illusions at an attempt to destroy their credibility. The plot thickens as Angier becomes obsessed with one of Borden's newest tricks, due to his inability to understand its inner workings. Plagued with his misunderstanding of the illusion, Angier attempts to copy or re-create the trick, but due to its finally, never enjoys the audiences amazement after the prestige is finally revealed.Nolan uses a non-linear storyline to confuse us, and to ultimately try and take attention away from some of the vast plot holes within the films twists, turns and surprises. Despite its flaws within the plot and some of the mediocre acting, compliments of the ever so dull, faintly British accented Scarlett Johansson, The Prestige does lend a sort of entrancement into the world of 18th century magicians only Nolan could make alluring. Teaming back up with his brother Jonathan Nolan, the writing/directing team has fallen miles short of their first collaboration, the artfully masterful play on the human memory, Memento.When The Prestige finally shows us the prestige, or third act of its illusion, it is not as shocking as Nolan intended it to be. It seems that the brotherly duo tried too hard in the implementation of the prestige, they forgot to solidify the first two acts of the film or trick, depending on how far you would like to take this metaphor. Finally, The Prestige is a beautiful piece of film, with a few flaws that keep it from being a perfect film, but will surely be an upstanding contender in this years Oscar race."
" *Spoiler* about Angier
",,"Here's what I think. I don't know if it's already been stated, but I'm sending it anyway.The first time Angier ""transported"" himself he did transport himself, leaving the clone behind. That's what I gather from the scene, because it seems that the clone picked up the gun as Angier was trying to explain that he was the real one, but was shot before he could finish. So from then on out the clones died. That explains the reason why at the end when Borden is down there Angier is so shocked from drowning. Yes, it could all be part of the frame up, or he could just be freaking out because he was in fact drowning. And that's got to suck. But you'd think after the first time of going through that, if it was him who was dying every night and not the clone, he'd figure out a different way. So go ahead. Tear me apart."
" Not so sure...
",spoiler,"First off, this movie was misrepresented in it's trailer. It absolutely made it out that Christian Bale's character (Alfred) had some kind of real power to do his magic and that's what was stumping Hugh Jackman's character (Robert). The quote that Michael Caine's character used to give us this impression (in the trailer) was never in the movie. We kept looking for Alfred's ""secret"" of the supernatural sort.I wasn't completely disappointed since there was my gratuitous ""Hugh's got his shirt off again"", but what girl wouldn't like that? I can't wait to see Flushed Away to see if his cartoon character has his shirt off. Anyway, back to the movie. I was a little confused because after all, having 2 kids does remove some brain cells, however, I did enjoy the plot twists and having to actually think during a movie was refreshing.We didn't know how dark it would be. There were a lot of missing explanations such as, why did they hate each other so much, since Robert's wife death was an accident. Why did Robert wait until the strange funeral to ask which knot he tied? Why did Edison have thugs? Where did Robert get all this money? If it's because he was the ""Lord"" guy, that makes no sense. I guess my hubby and I are also a bit disappointed because there was no real ""hero"" for which to root. So, like they were both creepy. They both were real losers. What's wrong with them??? A little too much human hatred at the risk of all others for us. That is insanity, not obsession. So, leaving just left us kind of empty. Having a lot of questions after a movie is cool, but it really had no redeeming qualities (except of course, Hugh shirtless that is!!).If you want a really good plot twist (that you could understand)movie, I suggest ""Death Trap"". There's no Hugh, but there is Michael Caine again and a fantastic story and ending!"
" Possibly the best picture of the 21st century
",,"I'm going to keep this short and to the point, I've got to admit, this, for me as an experienced film composer, is probably the best written and most entertaining film of the 21st century thus far. On a whole new level in comparison to some of the other pictures and screenings with similar settings. It literally kept me in my seat glued to the screen in attempt to understand and comprehend the plot at hand. The acting was superb, really impressed with Jackman's and Bale's performance! Great actors as far as i'm concerned. Caine and Johansson added great flavor and were completely appropriate. I recommend this video 100%, whether it be at home with the family and friends, or by yourself at theater or with your loved one (Kelly), there just isn't a setting in which this movie isn't superb. Not surprised if it is listed as an academy nominee, should be rated higher on IMDb.10/10"
" Great discussion movie
",,"I really enjoyed this movie. Very suspenseful, funny, and entertaining. Great acting as well and love to see Cain anytime. The movie was a little confusing as to what actually eventually happens. Most of the people I saw the movie with think that Borden had a twin brother. However I tend to think that Borden cloned himself and let the clone live. This leads to many questions. Was it Borden or the clone that was hung?....I think Borden. How come they did not suspect that Angier had bought a transporter machine?.....or did Borden's clone not know that he was a clone and that there ever was a transporter machine? Did the clones know they were going to die? You can amuse yourself for hours talking about this kind of stuff. very good movie."
" abrakaDRABra aka anticlimactic has a new ending
",spoiler,"After reading a few reviews, I approached the watching of this film with much anticipation. For better than half the movie, that anticipation was heightened. I felt that as the energy on screen was building, that energy was leaving the audience,including me. To borrow a line from another movie Christian Bale starred in, ""Sometines, things just go bad."" And, they did.I do want to spoil the implausible end. However, it wasn't that the characters couldn't have been such psychological misfits unless of course they all came from the movie next door, Saw 3, which grossed 34 mill last week, to this movie's 6 mill.This movie left me with an uneasy feeling, but not enough to fire any excess emotion. Anticlimactic has a new ending."
" Rival magicians get seriously vicious in another twisted tale of identity, guilt & redemption from the Nolans, who brought you ""Memento""
",spoiler,"The Nolan Brothers sure know how to mess with a viewer's mind! In their time twister, ""Memento,"" a lowlife cannot form new memories after a vicious blow to the head. There the Nolans - Christopher directing and collaborating with his brother Jonathan in writing the screenplay - turned the tables on time (moving backward from the present in overlapping segments), personal history and culpability, as the protagonist uses Polaroid photos and other aids as substitutes for recall in his desperate attempt to find the person that killed his wife and left him badly damaged. I had to see ""Memento"" twice to get the complex arc of the thing.Now, in ""The Prestige,"" a period film about magic and magicians, set in 1878 in London and Colorado Springs, the Nolans are at it again, messing with time, identity, guilt and me. Things are even more complicated in this maddening, fascinating movie that's part thriller, part melodrama, and part science fiction. And, so, once again, I had to squander precious time and effort, seeing this movie twice in order to get the fine points, often spoken in brief, toss off lines, or visually displayed in tiny fragments, glimpsed for an instant, then gone again.Without entirely giving away the secrets of this film, which would be felonious, I can safely say this much. Two aspiring young magicians become bitter rivals, their increasingly vicious attitudes toward one another fueled by acts that inflict pain and loss for each. The impoverished Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), is an ingenious inventor of tricks but a poor showman. Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman), comes from wealth; he's a slick showman but far less creative than Borden.Borden produces a dazzling new stage trick, ""The Transported Man,"" in which, within the span of just a few seconds, he disappears through a doorway on one side of the stage, then reappears through another doorway on the opposite side, in time to catch a rubber ball he had set bouncing across the stage before disappearing! The crowds are wowed, and Borden becomes the toast of the town. Angier tries to duplicate the trick, even sending his newest stage assistant, Olivia (a distractingly buxom Scarlett Johannson) to spy on Borden. Instead the sham in Angier's act is exposed by Borden.Humiliated, Angier goes off to America to meet the controversial inventor of alternating current electricity, Nikola Tesla (David Bowie). Angier wants Tesla to create an electrical machine that will enhance his magic show. Angier stays on for more than a year, bankrolling Tesla's problem plagued efforts to produce the contraption Angier desires.Ultimately Tesla's efforts pay off. Angier returns to London and launches a new stage production in which Tesla's imposing device, generating impressive electrical arcs, is able somehow to make Angier disappear from the stage and reappear in seconds high in the theater's balcony. Matters turn decidedly more grim from this point forward: people are killed, or seem to be. In the end justice prevails, or does it? Compared to the manipulation of time in ""Prestige,"" ""Memento"" seems, well, almost straightforward. In ""Prestige,"" we switch back and forth among three timeframes: the early careers of the rival magicians, leading up to their competing 'transported man' acts; the period of ferment and exile when Angier lives in Colorado, then returns to mount his extraordinary new show, employing Tesla's machine; and, finally, the morbid developments that follow, and their resolution.Early on, we receive lessons on the structure of good magic tricks from a veteran London magic man, John Cutter (Michael Caine), who gave Angier and Borden their first jobs. To be successful, Cutter intones, a trick must follow a three step sequence: first, ""The Pledge"" (when the magician shows the audience something ordinary), next ""The Turn"" (in which the ordinary object is made to do something extraordinary), and, finally, ""The Prestige"" (when the audience is shown something shocking that they've never seen before).I think the Nolans have used this formula to great advantage in creating the structure of their narrative: the early rivalry and love interests of the young magicians are ordinary stuff. Tesla's machine surely can transform the ordinary into something extraordinary. And events toward the end, concerning personal identity, guilt and redemption, show us shocking things we've never seen before. So, bravo to the Nolans for their ingenuity.Bale and Jackman perform competently, each displaying impressive range. All three of the men's love interests, are well played (Piper Perabo as Julia, young Angier's wife; Rebecca Hall, as Borden's partner, Sarah; and Ms. Johannson, who manages to insinuate herself as mistress to both men).But the scene stealers in this movie are Michael Caine and David Bowie. It is a treat to see Caine in top form as an understated, wise but world weary fellow who's done it all. His performance has depth and grace, and is achieved with seeming effortlessness. Bowie is a wonderful surprise. His Tesla - displaying a formal, almost stiff manner and cautious, circumspect speaking style, with a splendid east European accent  perfectly captures the reserve we would expect of a man who had become the object of international controversy and defamation.""Memento"" is daringly complex but its premise holds up well, in part because the Nolans modeled the protagonist's handicap on an actual neurosurgical patient. ""Prestige"" is based on a 1995 novel by Christopher Priest that I haven't read. There are continuity problems in the film (see the IMDb's ""Goofs"" observed in ""Prestige""). Some of the disguises the two rivals wear to scope out or foil each other's work are way inadequate: if I can spot these dudes in a heartbeat, why can't they? More importantly, I think the movie is overly burdened, made unwieldy, by its complexity. It's surely not a great film, or a ground-breaking one in the sense that ""Memento"" was. But, like a well performed magic show, it's still darn good entertainment. My grades: 8/10 (B+) (Seen on 10/28/06)"
" ""Batman Begins"" meets ""Memento""?
",spoiler,"I had very little knowledge of what this movie was about, and was starting to think about the other ""magician"" movie that was released earlier this summer with Edward Norton as I watched the opening credits. It was somewhat slow as it began (but then again, was this going to begin with a car chase/bank robbery?), but it was interesting when they began to reveal some of their secrets by the second reel.After a lot of holes that had been dug up and some not quite filled, I began to tune out of this film more and more- thinking about what I was going to eat that night for dinner, the laundry, etc.- but I kept focus, particularly at the film's climax. Basically, there was a twist layered upon twist layered upon twist, and I felt slightly annoyed that this has now become a standard in storytelling (along with excessive uses of flashbacks). Nolan's usage of twists and flashbacks were channeled eloquently in 2000's ""Memento,"" but now it has become somewhat sloppy.The reason why I didn't buy these twists were the mere fact that both of the story's main principals, Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale, didn't seem intelligent enough to anticipate and second guess each other. I mean, they were both clever at times, but if Jackman could not see that Scarlet Johanssen was playing him all along- how could he predict EVERY move that Bale made like he did? It just did not seem plausible enough to convince me that either one of these characters were that brilliant. And maybe I missed it, but whatever happened to Jackman's double? Scarlet Johanssen is another issue. Not only has the woman been in every fourth movie, but she plays the fourth character as well for about the same amount of screen time per movie. She slips into this film, but slips out just as fast. I wish she would take more complicated roles because I thought she was somewhat interesting in 2001's ""Ghost World."" Perhaps she assumes the easy-on-the-eyes part whenever a casting director is in a snag on whom to cast for a female star in a film.""The Prestige"" has its moments and is fair. Sir Michael Caine has been better in other films, but never bad. I was surprised to see that David Bowie did not try to ham up the screen and instead appeared as a possible Pierce Brosnan as an old man instead.Perhaps this was Christopher Nolan's mainstream follow-up attempt to ""Memento,"" but seemed more like ""Insomnia"" meeting ""Batman Begins."""
" Just Plain Stupid.
",,"the era was ridiculous, the magic acts unbelievable, more like just plain Computer Graphics. The entire concept of this film is just pure loony. ""magic""? come on ! Only the stupid would regard any of this stuff entertaining. Dialogue was even dumber. Camera angles BORING . Yeah, tree's disappearing into thin air. Hahaha. so stupid. I was laughing so much in the Theatre. This IMDb is totally inaccurate. or the demographic is certainly skewed. The only redeeming element of this film was David Bowie's Character Nikola Tesla. If anyone can perform acts of extraordinary ability it'd be Nikola, he was a genius ignored by Americans cause of his Jewish/Hungarian heritage. Not to mention how Thomas Edison started a propaganda Campaign to discredit Nikola's inventions. Nikola developed a device that would allow the conversion of energy in such an efficient way that he wanted it to be Free. A free energy/electricity for everybody. Thomas Edison didn't want people to benefit from Free energy. and blah blah blah,.. okay the movie was just plain stupid, did I write enough here yet ?"
" The Best Movie of 2006!!!
",,"I loved this amazing movie! The basic plot concerns two magicians with an intense rivalry that becomes so intense that they begin doing horrible things just to out-do each other.There are many twists and turns in the film and the film stays consistently interesting. There are many thrills and a lot of mystery in the film also to keep you guessing! You must pay close attention to the film, for if you miss one scene then you're likely to not have a clue what's going one. But the movie is extremely entertaining, so it is unlikely you'll want to miss anything! This is a very fantastic film, and sci-fi fans, mystery fans, and just about everyone else will love it! There are many shocking twists in it that the audience was gasping and ""ooh""-ing at when I went to see it! This is a great movie, and so far, the best movie of 2006! I give this one a 10 out of 10."
" Remarkably smart, yet sadly dark
",,"In many ways this film is about duality and extremes, and that theme also carries over into audience reaction. What works about this movie works brilliantly -- excellent cast and acting, intricate plot with lots of twists and turns to keep you engaged and entertained. Yet what doesn't work about this movie fails in a way that is difficult to overlook. The ""big secret"" is unexplained, unexplored and a bit too far out there to really be believed. In a way it almost feels like the writers created this wonderful maze, but in the end couldn't figure out a plausible way to get out of it and resolve the storyline. The final ""twist"" is disappointingly dumb in comparison to the intelligence with which the majority of this beautifully twisty turny plot is constructed. The other incongruity of this film that is difficult to reconcile is that the elaborate dueling of the magicians is great fun for the audience -- wondering and guessing at the tricks, what they will do next. But the obsessive competitiveness between the men themselves - the motivation behind their cleverness - is NOT fun. It's dark and sad, as both men simply sink deeper into heartless one-upsmanship, inflicting more and more damage, neither of them pausing, reflecting, or regretting -- neither learning anything. That's why it's hard to know what to make of this film -- remarkably smart and satisfying on some levels, yet disappointingly cheap and heartless on others."
" This movie has the pledge, the turn and the prestige
",,"This is a movie about two rival illusionists, Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale), who try to outdo each other's tricks and prove to be the better one. And while they are trying to learn the secrets of each others' tricks, they also sabotage each other's shows. One day, Alfred invents a trick that seems to deny the laws of physics (but after all, this is magic and all magic tricks seem to deny the laws of physics). Robert sets his mind to figuring out Alfred's trick and improving it so he can come out as the better magician. His journey to understanding Alfred's trick takes Robert to the US where he meets a scientist who seems to have found a way to manipulate electrical energy at a whole new level. He invests his money in a machine that can perform real magic (something all illusionists claim to do but only wizards can do).The movie begins with Alfred being accused of murdering Robert (while Robert was performing his magic with that electrical machine) and sentenced to death penalty. Since they are known to have sabotaged each other's shows, people take this to be one of those incidents that just ended up deadly for Robert. As Alfred is in jail, he gets Robert's journal and begins reading it. From this moment on, the movie moves backward in time and we get to see how the feud between the two magicians initially began and the events leading up to the Robert's death. The movie doesn't follow a straight time line and can be a little confusing at times. With Alfred's reading Robert's journal in where Robert speaks of reading Alfred's notes, sometimes it is hard to know where we are at the story.Overall, I think the Prestige is a pretty good movie and I must add that it owes much of its success to directing skills of Christopher Nolan. The way he tells the story piece by piece as he pulls them from different places and times can easily go wrong but he is very good at doing that. I also liked the unknown element in the movie. There were some simple explanations to the seemingly magical tricks and there were also some unknown, sci-fi elements."
" good technique but still a bit disappointing
",,"Don't get me wrong. The acting was superb. Jackman, Bale, Caine, Johansson and the rest of the cast gave admirable performances. Visually, the movie was stimulating but the culmination was so-so. And sure I wouldn't weigh it so much but I must, because this is a thriller, so the resolution is considerably important. Maybe I had too high of an expectation. I absolutely enjoyed Memento. Loved it. I guess I was expecting something of the same intensely witty mind blowing resolution. The other reason it receives a rather low score for me is that the movie runs a bit long and lags at certain points both plot wise and clue-dropping wise. But if you don't mind a fairly uninspiring resolution and can pay attention through the rather slow portions of this movie, by all means go watch it. It is a wonderfully captured and edited movie with wonderful acting. It is definitely thought provoking and you will leave the theater discussing the twists of the movie. The question is- will you be discussing it in a disappointed manner or an enthralled manner? All in all it was decent."
" um mm....now i need someone else to explain SPOILER
",spoiler,"yeah..i don't know about everyone else. but i totally thought bale just copied himself once. and it was not his twin brother. i mean...i did think at first it was...but then why would his secret be Tesla..you know what bale gave Hugh when he asked for his ""code"" or secret...whatever. i don't know. someone just explain. OH and bales secret was definitely not obvious. Hugh's was, with the hats n all. but i just thought bale was like split personality. other than that i thought it rocked hardcore and the best movie i have seen in a long time. i think that Christian Bale is a amazing actor. there was some great acting in it and all.and the whole thing about the bird and the little kid did not give it away for me. plus i don't understand the whole code thing. maybe thats what threw me off."
" A slow, obscure story done very well
",,"After all the critical brouhaha, I found this film a snore. Ponderous. Glad I saw a screening and didn't have to pay for it.I started out wanting to like this film. It's visually beautiful - great art direction and visual effects, but the pace is much too stately and the major plot lines are too purposely obscure. There is a sense of obsession and an undercurrent of evil, but it's so well hidden you aren't scared, or very interested. While Bale, Caine, Jackman, Johansson, et al gave credible performances, we don't care about the characters enough to attempt to wind the confusing threads of plot into a story we care about. I found the ending ""Yeah, and?..."" Compare and contrast this with 1967's ""Eye of The Devil"" with David Niven, Deborah Kerr, Sharon Tate, et al. While some think this film somewhat slow and muddled, the viewer cares about Catherine's fear and suspicion of the ominous conspiracy surrounding her, her husband, and children, yet she never stops loving Phillipe. You sense Phillipe's love for her and because of this, his ambivalence about accepting his approaching fate, which Catherine discovers, to her horror. And despite her best efforts to protect the children after Phillipe is sacrificed, we see at the end that their young son secretly accepts his gruesome legacy. Wish it had been better./DJ"
" 2/3 a good movie....
",spoiler,"I'll make this quick, the acting and premise of the movie are great. But (and you knew there'd be a but) the ending doesn't work. I guess with all the hype and all of the creative folks involved, especially the Nolans, I thought there'd be something 'more.' As in, the whole concept of the surprise ending revolves around the unreal and nonfactual event of teleportation/cloning. Since cloning is in its infancy (and not done the way portrayed in the film) and since teleportation has never been achieved, the film left me with a 'that's it?' feeling. I hoped for a catch, something cool like the concept of 'Memento' wherein the main character is also the killer (in a way, without getting too explanatory). Anyways, that's my comment. Feel free to make your own..."
" Nolan's sleight of hand
",,"The first film of Christopher Nolan I saw was his remake of the 1997 Norwegian film ""Insomnia,"" and I found it brilliant. Since then I've been hearing a lot of recommendations of his earlier work ""Memento"" (which I have yet to find a copy of). I was also impressed by how Nolan maintained the grit while providing intellect to ""Batman Begins."" So it was but natural that along with Martin Scorsese's ""The Departed,"" one of my most anticipated films this season is Nolan's ""The Prestige."" Based from the novel by Christopher Priest, ""The Prestige"" is a film that tells the tale of two 19th century magicians - Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and Robert Angier (Hugh Jackman) - who are in constant hostility as they try to outdo each other's performance. It is 1878 and Borden is tried by a London court for the murder of Angier during one of the latter's performances. While awaiting his execution, Borden starts reading Angier's diary.Subsequently, the film proceeds in a series of flashbacks. Borden and Angier start out as assistants for a magician whose shows include the risky predicament escape: Angier's wife (Piper Perabo) is tied and placed in a tank filled with water and while hidden from the audience's view, she must free herself from the ropes, and open the trick lock. But a mistake during one performance cost her life as she failed to slip her wrists out of the ropes and eventually drowned.With Angier believing that Borden is responsible for his wife's death, the two went on their separate ways and become magicians as well. Eventually, Borden becomes famous with his ""The Transported Man"" act and Angier grows obsessed in finding out its secret. He sends his assistant Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) to work for Borden with the hope of gaining the knowledge behind Borden's trick but backfires as Olivia falls in love with Borden.Angier then enlists the help of Nikola Tesla (David Bowie), who reluctantly agrees to build a machine that is supposedly set to aid Angier in performing what could be his greatest trick. What ensues is a labyrinth of twists and sleights of hand that to go into details is far too complicated. Let it just be said that the world inhabited by the characters of ""The Prestige"" is eerily dark and suggestive of the supernatural.I had high hopes prior to seeing this film as I've said, and although it wasn't as great as I expected coming from the director, I still find it to be interesting and agreeably diverting. Nolan and his brother/co-scriptwriter Jonathan has paced the film clearly and straightforward. The plot's details are relatively concealed and restrained at least a few minutes before the denouement, wherein anyone who's been closely paying attention will know the sleight of hand to be employed by the filmmakers for the film's final trick.The cast gives good performances despite their crudely written characters. From the exaggeratedly scrawny guy in ""The Machinist"" to Bruce Wayne in ""Batman Begins,"" Bale completely inhabits a different character in every film he's in, and he's always believable. Jackman possesses the strength and the determined fixation to lend credibility to his character's motives. Johansson doesn't have much to do here but she provides a feminine touch.""The Prestige"" is finely crafted movie and a worthy addition to the director's resume. It suffers a bit from its tarrying on some parts and from its inclination to spell out so much justification from the characters, but these are compensated by the superior narrative style, good performances, and the opulent sets of the Victorian era. It may not be an outstanding achievement but Nolan is deft enough to make the film's illusions seem genuine."
" Could Have Been Better
",spoiler,"""The Prestige"" has potential, but fails to fully reach it.The story follows two budding illusionists, Rupert Angier (Hugh Jackman) and Alfred Borden (Christian Bale) and a bitter rivalry that ensues after a disheartening tragedy.The Angier, Borden, Cutter (Michael Caine) and Angier's wife Julia (Piper Perabo) are stagehands for a magic act. A tragedy that ends out taking the life of Julia is to be blamed on Borden and Angier begins to become full of rage.From then on, the movie follows them as they open their own magic acts and try and out-do each other. Cutter joining Angier and bringing along a helper named Olivia (Scarlett Johansson) as Angier runs his own magic show with his stagehand (His name escapes me at the moment, and I can't find a credit for him) Borden pulls off a magic trick that has Angier scratching his head. He asks his new found love, Olivia, to join Borden and be a spy. The movie continues to take you one way and then turn you another. Angier turns to a wizard in order to help him create something that will put Borden out of business. We're not quite sure what it does for awhile, but we know it's not a ""Trick"" and we also don't know what exactly is going on since the movie keeps jumping back and forth between present day, a very long time ago, a short time ago, a long time ago again, etc.And if you are wondering ""Hey, whatever happened to ScarJo?"" I am asking the same question. She just kind of disappears.It all comes together in the end and everything is explained, but it's almost not worth the trouble of being so confused the rest of the time.Their are plenty of twists, but I was able to call all of them before they happened. Not tooting my own horn, just letting you know that I found the twists somewhat predictable. It was a good movie, I'm sorry if I'm acting like it's not, but it's because I know it could have been so much better."
" When are we going to have a ""Carter Beats the Devil""?
",spoiler,"As I'm sure there will be dozens of poetic write ups for this movie available, I'll cut to the chase. What could have been a simple period piece about magicians was instead a decent drama. It had an atmosphere similar to what I would expect a feature film of Carter Beats the Devil to have. When are we going to be able to see that get turned into a movie? What made this one unique was the fact that amongst the obvious, even expected, mysteries expected to entertain the audience, there were a few that catch you off guard. Get the audience thinking in one direction and then show them something they didn't think was possible. Not sure if it fell on the editing floor, but there's no explanation for how Hugh Jackman knew Christian Bale went under the stage and made the decision not to conclude the show by coming out for the prestige part, thereby setting Bale up for murder. Anyone figure that out from the movie? Also, I can't remember Hugh or Bale's character name. I could only think of them as themselves. Same holds true for most actors in the movie except one. Tesla, I mean, David Bowie, was phenomenal. Small role, but done very well. In an era where magicians lived the grand life of rock star performers, it's an homage to have Bowie/tesla the scientist make his entrance through a performance curtain of high energy electricity."
" Watchable, but too predictable
",,"I'd have liked it a lot more if only I hadn't figured things out early on in the show. Far too many clues were given - at least for me. Scarlett Johansen though was stunning. All the acting was very good, and the sets were great. Quite watchable, just not very surprising.David Bowie did a fine job (heck, I didn't even recognize him). The outdoor scenery was excellent. The interiors sets were very accurate for the period/location - both the style and ""upkeep"" - in fact, I think it deserves an Oscar for the sets.All the actors and actresses did an excellent job, even the twins who played the little girl - I expect we'll see more of them in the years to come."
" A great mix of inventive storytelling amid the mystery of magic
",,"Sure, there are explosions and fires and bursts of electricity. There is at least one death and one chase scene, but there is more to this one. It's a compelling and often brilliant story about magic, science, good and evil. And it's set in 20th century London. The film is almost flawless. Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale are both fine as rivaling magicians. They trade the roles of antagonist and protagonist throughout the film. And Bale has continued becoming a very interesting actor, at least one who takes really great roles. Though, Michael Caine really steals the show. He has a very warm role as Putter, the teacher, who is wise and complicated. Rebecca Hall is brilliant as Sarah, Rupert's wife. And David Bowie is less irritating than usual as the great Tesla. The editing is slick and helps the movie progress seamlessly. It's a very involving movie."
" Let's be a bit more objective about this, shall we?
",,"Let me start my review by saying that I enjoyed this movie. It was a thoroughly entertaining 2+ hours, and I certainly did not leave the theater feeling like I did not get my $10's worth. However, in reading some of the other reviews here, I feel as though I need to say something about the obvious flaws in this movie.Christopher Nolan is a very good director/writer, however, this is not one of his best and certainly does not display the genius we saw in his other works, such as Momento. There were a number of twists and turns in this story, but in the end, the outcome was a bit predictable. I also felt that the movie was a bit too long for the outcome and even found myself a bit bored at some points.Visually, The Prestige is beautiful and warrants a 10/10 review solely based on this. However, the screenplay and the acting falls short in my eyes. Most notably - I absolutely love Scarlett Johansen, but this movie seemed to be a bit above her abilities, or she otherwise was eclipsed by the acting abilities of the rest of the cast.Bottom Line: Don't be deceived by all of the glowing reviews. While The Prestige is worth your time and your money, don't expect to exit the theater thinking that this is one of the best movies you've seen this year."
" Very good but ending lacked the dramatic impact that it might have
",,"First the really good stuff - great style, sets, costumes, acting, etc. A very good period type piece and solid cast all the way around.The only real weakness were a few of Nolan's decisions on the cutting room floor. A key ""surprise"" ending was perfectly obvious with 15+ minutes remaining. There was certainly no cascade of gasps in our theater as per Six Sense. A tragic weakness, as this film could have easy have been a 10 all the way around. Nolan could have accomplished the ultimate surprise ending that was horrifying and hit us with a huge ""oh my god"" but didn't.I suspect that he simply underestimated the audience, that we would be too dumb to ""get it"" if he didn't fill in all the blanks ... and much too soon. Assuming that he did wish to ensure that the audience wouldn't miss the point, he could have had a little extra dialog between Angier and Borden at the end, and a little pan around with one of those awesome lanterns.If you MUST assume that the audience is stupid, and needs all the pieces - then give them to us AFTER the reveal or DURING the reveal, not way way before.Anyway, in most respects I did truly enjoy the movie and am glad to have seen it in the theater - it needs the big screen! But, yes, I feel left down as Nolan could have knocked this one out of the park. So, I won't go to the theater again but will definitely watch it again someday on DVD or Dish etc. Perhaps via a directors cut DVD we might see what this movie should have been."
" Lacks substance, but is so much fun you won't care too much
",,"Not as good as Memento or Nolan's first film, Following, but thankfully much better than last summer's Batman Begins (never saw Insomnia). Nolan goes back to the mystery / suspense genre with this tale of two rival magicians (Hugh Jackman and Christian Bale) who compete with each other, sometimes viciously. The film lives on its twists and turns, so it's not a good idea to spoil any of the plot. I thought the movie was pretty entertaining. It's always fun, and I always was eager to see what came next. The twists and secrets are generally pretty good, though one of the story's biggest secrets becomes painfully obvious too early on. I think most of the audience will begin to recognize Nolan's very obvious attempt at sleight of hand whenever a particular character's face is on camera for more than a handful of frames. That doesn't harm the entertainment value too much. What I would have liked, and what I think would have made the film much more memorable, is a bit more emotional involvement. The characters are universally two-dimensional here. They're all just a cipher for the plot. The movie had absolutely no thematic complexity, either. Neither one of these things that it lacks is particularly far from its grasp. And without complex characters or themes, the film is just a ""Wow, this is cool!"" rather than a ""What is it that I just experienced?"" I know that, to so many in the IMDb community, that's the same thing, but it really isn't. I do think Nolan succeeded at finding depth with Memento, but he certainly hasn't here. Still, I'm satisfied with it just being a cool popcorn movie."
" Not to be confused with ""The Illusionist""
",,"""The Illusionist"" and ""The Prestige"" both are end-of-the-century period pieces dealing with magicians. However, ""The Illusionist"" is a beautiful movie. Beautiful visually and beautiful inside the hearts of some of the characters. ""The Prestige"" is an ugly movie. Visually it is dark and gloomy, and the central characters are unpleasant to their core.""The Illusionist"" is truly magical. ""The Prestige"" is more like a gangster/revenge movie at heart. Actually, heart is what it lacks.David Bowie is wonderful, however, in his supporting role as the eccentric genius inventor Nicolai Tesla."
" Tedious. Convoluted.
",,"The movie was slow moving. Unduly complex, as the the competing magicians tried to outdo each other and learn the other's secrets. The audio was terrible as I had a hard time figuring out their mumbling diction. The movie was too long. It could have been finished in under 100 minutes.The acting was good and the movie was well cast. Hugh Jackman and Scarlett Johansson do a good job but Scarlett's fate was left unexplained and she just disappeared from the screen. The score was just mediocre and the direction could be a little crisper. Movies set in England in the 19th century have a dark hue which I suppose is required to depict the truth but it leaves me depressed."
" Magic ""tricks""
",,"I found it jarring that the movie kept using the term ""trick,"" as in ""The greatest magic trick I've ever seen."" If you see the trick, it's not good magic. This is particularly annoying since the introduction (included in the previews) purports to give you a lesson in magicians' terminology, (the Pledge, the Turn, the Prestige) and then goes on to use grade-school argot. A magic trick is something you buy at Jack's Joke Shop. Magicians don't ""do tricks"", they perform, and the performance involves a series of effects or illusions, not a bunch of tricks. An effect may involve one or more tricks (slights, gimmicks, etc.) and it's proper to refer to them as such, but to confuse the effect and the trick is a vulgar error. You don't display tricks, but there may be a trick to what you do. The effect isn't a secret, since that's what people see. The trick IS a secret. Professionals at the turn of the century were pretty huffy about this."
" No Hocus Pocus here
",,"Following the plot is a little confusing at first, but once you get into the swing of the flashbacks, it's a fascinating movie. And the casting, my god, it's genius: Two of the hottest, most talented male actors under 40 - Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman; the latest It Girl - Scarlett Johanson; an established character actor - Michael Caine; and a rock legend - David Bowie. An article in Premiere Magazine says that both Bale and Nolan agreed that right after the first viewing, they wanted to watch it again. I can see why: there are so many layers to this movie that it will take a few watchings to understand and truly appreciate what's happening. Don't know if any of the performances are Oscar-worthy, but it's definitely a film to watch this fall."
" Go see it !
",,"This is an very good ""period"" film. The look of the movie (sets, costumes, etc.) are excellent and work well to set the dark, mysterious tone. Christian Bale is well cast as magician Alfred Borden and Scarlett Johansson, Michael Caine, & Hugh Jackman all turn in nice performances. Jackman especially seems to have fun with his portrayal of the drunkard, out of work actor ""Root"". David Bowie however, as Nikola Tesla was disappointing. Having read the book it was probably easier following the story's twists and turns better than someone who has not read it. That said, the screenplay for this film is so much different from Christopher Priest's book, I was confused by some of the movie's jumping back and forth from past to present. Although not as creepy as the book's conclusion, I found the movie's ending more satisfying."
" Great movie, actors...
",,"Well, the movie is great, actors great, everything....BUT - very clear to solve whole movie trick, beginning. They should not have shown the whole scene with the Angier's death in the tank...made me know the end and all the trick a lot earlier than I wanted. All other aspects are just great! Michael Caine is the greatest artist, Jackman is great too. I loved the performance of all the actors and the costumes, photographs were great! I will definitely watch the movie again, but with closer look! This movie is really one of the best movies, I have seen ""Batman Begins"" and this one is a lot more interesting, but just until you realise what the trick is. And as mentioned before, it is too early as for me..."
" Great Movie Despite Surprisingly Average Acting
",,"After reading the plot, I knew I had to see this at the theater and all in all, I must say that I was not disappointed. Solid story well presented and edited in a way that ensures the viewer is constantly surprised and interested. The script is excellent and so is the basic storyline. Kudos to the Nolan brothers for delivering yet another masterpiece.I agree with many other reviewers that this film deserves at least some kind of Oscar nomination, but I must criticize the movie for the very average acting demonstration of the two main characters. Jackman and Bale are both so-so in their roles, and this movie will not be remembered thanks to their performance. Johansson and Caine on the other hand are great as usual.I highly recommend seeing this at the theaters and actually also buying it on DVD, though I believe that it will mostly be enjoyed by mature audiences (i.e. 21+): little violence or nudity here, but a very dark subject matter.Hugh Jackman (Rupert Angier) - 5/10 - Not too impressed with his non-wolverine abilities.Christian Bale (Alfred Borden) - 6/10 - Gave an eerie Batman-esquire feel to his character, which though can be argued to be in character felt inaccurate to me.Michael Caine (Cutter) - 9/10 - Showing the young ones how it's done.Rebecca Hall (Sarah) - 8/10 - Strong performance from this newcomer.Scarlett Johansson (Olivia Wenscombe) - 8/10 - Strong performance, though by now, regulars should know that I am a big fan.Christopher Nolan - 10/10 - Excellent work, once again."
" Even better than the book!
",,"Christopher Nolan has once again outdone himself. He has taken a tale that has already received international acclaim and boldly changed it into something even more spectacular. For once I was not disappointed that I had read the book before seeing the movie. Although the book is also great, this film makes a few minor changes to the story that have a major impact on how this movie works. The pace is changed up quite nicely and doesn't follow the same linear format of the book. There are also some new tricks introduced that are very pleasing to the eye as well as the mind. Most importantly, the movie does a great job starting the rivalry off with clear reasoning, which the book, although stated very plainly, was still a little bit ambiguous and confusing. The roles are brilliantly cast and Christian Bale in particular does a stand-out job as the cold, calculating, and very one-dimensional Borden. Much like a good magic trick, this movie will astound you with it's secrets and will have you thinking about it long after the credits start rolling. Even as someone who had read the book and thought he knew all the secrets - I must admit I was mystified and just as caught up in it as everyone around me. The Prestige is true movie magic!"
" What film did this remind you of?
",,"For me this movie had more in common with ""The Sting"" than any film I have seen in years.Outstanding period costumes and sets. Art direction was amazing. The Sets and costumes were so real that you just got lost in them. Just like ""The Sting"".Convoluted and time shifting, terrific plot. You always knew what was going on but were totally surprised by the twists... Possibly even better than ""The Sting"". I loved it... Cain should win the supporting actor Oscar for this and the people in charge of costumes, sets and writing should be rewarded as well. One of my favorite films of 2006 without a doubt.It has been a couple of years since I have enjoyed a film this much. A great film about Magic and showmanship, about obsession and about illusion. Bravo!"
